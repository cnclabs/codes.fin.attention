introduction business overview we are a truckload transportation services provider headquartered in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for customers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on a short to medium length of haul 
the principal types of freight we transport include consumer staples  retail  paper products  packaging plastics  manufacturing  and import export commodities 
we provide truckload carrier services from our asset based dry van  temperature controlled  and drayage service centers  as well as brokerage services from our brokerage branches 
as of december   we operated asset based service centers consisting of dry van drayage service centers and six temperature controlled service centers and non asset based brokerage branches 
our asset based service centers and brokerage branches are successful standalone businesses that complement one another to deliver solutions to our customers that we otherwise could not provide 
the results of our brokerage activities were relatively minor for and  therefore  a detailed discussion of the financial results of these operations will not be separately presented 
our business is affected by cycles and other factors that bear on shipping demand and industry wide trucking capacity 
from to  we achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
our growth was driven by expanding our service center network  acquisitions  and rate increases during a generally positive shipping environment 
from through  our growth slowed as a result of economic conditions 
the broad based economic recession and declining shipment activity within our industry in late and early led to intense competition and rate reductions in  contributing to a decrease in revenue before fuel surcharge in in comparison to our industry leading operating margins and debt free balance sheet have afforded us with substantial cash flows and financial flexibility 
during times of more robust freight demand  we have been able to expand our fleet and terminal network internally and through acquisitions largely through internally generated cash 
during times when fleet growth is undesirable  such as in and  we generate cash that can be used for stock repurchases  dividend payments  and as a source for future needs 
during  our cash and short term investment balance increased million  after using million for dividend payments and stock repurchases 
since january   we have paid million in dividends  used million to repurchase shares of our stock  and our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance has increased to million at december   from million at december  
table of contents during  we were once again named to forbes magazine s list of the best small companies in america 
we have been included on this list for consecutive years 
we also received an environmental excellence award from the us environmental protection agency epa smartway transport partnership in we were one of the companies from the partnership s more than  partners to be awarded the excellence award for reducing emissions and improving the environment 
operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable freight lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus on operating in distinct geographic markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating modern equipment  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and minimizing empty miles 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service  in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple stop pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
offering multiple solutions to our customers 
we are able to provide multiple truckload solutions among our dry van  temperature controlled  intermodal  and brokerage operations 
each of our businesses complement each other  reflecting our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers that also bring operational and economic benefits to knight 
our diversified service offerings continue to yield market share growth opportunities 
using technology to enhance our business 
we use technology to help us be more efficient with our equipment and our headcount 
we recognize the value technology brings as an accelerator in our operations 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop service centers and brokerage branches and the markets they serve in selected geographic areas and operate the service centers at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
the addition of our brokerage branches has enabled us to expand our customer service offerings by providing the non asset based capabilities of arranging with other carriers to haul our customers freight when the shipments do not fit our asset based model 
the development of our brokerage model strengthens our relationships with our customers because it provides our customers with more options and complements our existing dry van and temperature controlled truckload carrier services 
our brokerage model is also a less capital intensive way for us to grow our business 
in  we further enhanced our services with our drayage activities through knight intermodal  llc at the southern california ports  where we believe our familiarity with the markets  ability to offer intermodal shippers multiple services  and superior technology afford us a competitive advantage over many drayage operations 
we also expect our intermodal operations to be less capital intensive than our dry van and refrigerated operations  because our intermodal operations do not require trailers and we expect our tractors to remain in service longer 
the expansion of our services represents our continued progression as we build our brand as the premier national carrier  providing local service to the markets we serve 
the freight environment over the last several years has been challenging 
price competition remains intense 
in  many of the large fleets continued to downsize  and a good number of carriers closed their doors 
we have made the decision to maintain our fleet size as a long term strategy rather than downsizing  which may have negatively impacted our short term profitability 
we believe we are well positioned to grow when the market reverts to more of a supply and demand equilibrium 
beyond the immediate challenges that many carriers face  the issues of safety  security  and environmental restrictions are becoming increasingly stringent and costly 
we think all of these factors set the stage for future growth opportunities for low cost  high quality carriers that can self fund growth and serve customers on a national basis 
we believe these factors resonate with customers and will help us differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 

table of contents the most significant expenses in our business include fuel  driver related expenses such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and depreciation of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and service centers and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
since our inception an important element of our asset based operating model has been an extreme focus on our cost per mile 
we intend to carry this focus with us as we add new service centers  grow existing service centers  and make selective acquisitions 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows total revenue  including fuel surcharge  decreased  to million from million  revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased  to million from million  net income decreased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share decreased to from 
the industry wide supply of truckload equipment continued to outpace the freight demand  which pressured pricing and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
throughout  the year over year negative difference in our miles per tractor narrowed as the year progressed until fourth quarter  which turned positive for the first time in many quarters 
while near term challenges in the truckload industry remain  it appears to us that freight volumes bottomed sometime between june and july 
although significant improvement in miles per tractor is needed before returning to the levels experienced a few years ago  we believe that our late year improvement in miles per tractor  especially without major reductions in our tractor count  is evidence that we are in the early stages of a recovery in the truckload freight market 
in  we operated an average  tractors  which is fewer tractors compared to we finished the year with  tractors in the fleet  up slightly from  last year 
equipment productivity  as measured by average revenue before fuel surcharge per tractor  was down in while equipment productivity is down for the year  we experienced favorable sequential improvements each quarter as the year progressed 
our average revenue before fuel surcharge per tractor in the fourth quarter was nearly flat with a decrease of compared to the same quarter a year ago 
revenue per total mile before fuel surcharge decreased from a year ago 
our average length of haul decreased to miles in from miles in the drayage activities in our intermodal business had a modestly negative effect on our average length of haul 
miles per tractor was down overall for the year  while miles per tractor in fourth quarter of improved compared to the same quarter a year ago 
non paid miles remained nearly constant at for  compared to for during  our cash and short term investment balance increased million  after using million for shareholder dividends and stock repurchases 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
in  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for capital expenditures net of equipment sales 
since inception we have been profitable through multiple economic cycles 
we view these cycles as opportunities to gain market share from other competitors that do not have the financial staying power to survive the cycles 
these cycles also provide valuable experience to our managers that will help us develop the leaders to grow this business profitably 

table of contents our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
see off balance sheet transactions below for a description of our off balance sheet transactions 
trends and outlook at year end  we increased our fleet by tractors versus year end in this challenging environment  we will manage our fleet size carefully and consider internal growth or contraction of our tractor fleet as events unfold 
our year over year decline in miles per tractor has narrowed when compared sequentially to the preceding quarter  with the fourth quarter of being positive by 
we believe this is a positive sign of  and confirmation that  we are in the early stages of a recovery in the freight market 
we expect miles per tractor to be the first operating fundamental to improve  followed by revenue per mile improvement 
the length of time that we continue near the bottom will be predicated by the rate at which capacity continues to exit the marketplace and the change in overall demand 
we believe that if the broader demand were to maintain the current status quo  the exodus of supply could be meaningful enough to positively influence revenue per mile during while the bottom of the freight market appears to be behind us  we do not expect robust demand in the near term 
we will continue to utilize the flexibility of our decentralized model to react and adapt to market conditions 
we are always optimizing our model and refining our execution in reaction to  or in anticipation of  the truckload market dynamics 
we are patiently waiting for the right environment to continue our service center growth 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and other opportunities that create value for our shareholders and further advance our long term strategy 
we believe that our level of profitability  fleet renewal strategy  and use of independent contractors should enable us to internally finance attractive levels of fleet growth when demand conditions improve 
conversely  during times when we choose to maintain or trim our fleet levels  as we did over the last three years  our business is capable of generating significant cash flow from operations in excess of net capital expenditures that can be used for stock repurchases  dividend payments  and as a source for future needs 
in short  we believe we have significant financial flexibility to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead of us 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue including fuel surcharge revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue equipment lease expense revenue equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation miscellaneous operating expenses miscellaneous operating expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other income net interest and other income income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income there are minor rounding differences in the table 
gross fuel expense without fuel surcharge 
net fuel expense including fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for decreased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in due to falling diesel fuel prices in most of the year  our fuel surcharge revenue decreased in compared to in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe our relatively high variable costs as a percentage of revenue makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to million for  from million in we continue to face significant challenges as a result of the weak economic environment 
price competition remained intense as carriers struggled to maintain equipment productivity 
in  we experienced a high level of bid activity  particularly in the first quarter  contributing to a decrease in our average revenue per mile for the year 
supply of truckload equipment continued to outpace demand throughout  and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
declines in both revenue per mile and miles per tractor contributed to a decline in average freight revenue per tractor per week  to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in our non paid empty mile percent remained essentially constant at in from in despite the continued challenging truckload freight environment  our load count grew in compared to a year ago 
we ended with  tractors  an increase of tractors from a year ago 
salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in the decrease is due to increased efficiency in our non driver compensation and staffing levels and a decrease in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
at december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in diesel fuel price has been volatile over the past two years 
after reaching unprecedented record high fuel prices during most of  diesel fuel price started to fall in fourth quarter of and continued through the first quarter of the decrease in our fuel expense is due to the combination of lower diesel fuel prices  internal initiatives to improve fuel efficiency  and the decrease in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers versus independent contractors who purchase their own fuel 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of our fuel expense 
fuel surcharge revenue was million in  compared to million in declining fuel prices have led to significant decreases in fuel expense and fuel surcharge revenue this year 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in primarily because of a modest increase in fleet age and a decrease in revenue per tractor that less efficiently covered the fixed portion of these costs 
these items more than offset savings in this expense category from the decrease in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers versus the percentage provided by independent contractors  who pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for the reduction in this expense in resulted from lowered insurance accruals  which decreased as a result of reduced crash frequency  severity  and improved claim management practices  including a significant increase in subrogation recovery 
loss frequency and severity continues to be positively affected by our driver training program  which includes smith system training  a widely recognized leader in behind the wheel defensive driving training and recurrent driver training  as well as other internal loss control efforts aimed at reducing crash frequency and severity 
both our loss prevention and claim management practices have been instrumental in lowering insurance and claims expense in we believe that our internal loss control efforts  including smith system training and claim management practices  will continue to yield positive benefits 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to in  compared to in communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to in  compared to in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from in this increase is primarily due to a decrease in revenue and revenue per tractor in the current year 
this was partially offset by the average percentage of our tractor fleet operated by independent contractors who own their own tractors increasing from most of our fleet is late model equipment that consists primarily of tractors equipped with us epa emission compliant engines 
given higher prices for the epa compliant engines  we expect this category may increase going forward  although an improvement in revenue per tractor in a better freight environment could cause this category to increase by a smaller amount  or even decrease  as a percentage of revenue 
our service center network allows us to efficiently maintain this equipment 
in  we plan to continue a similar trade cycle and adopt the even cleaner burning engines that have just become available 
lease expense for revenue equipment was essentially zero in and we did not have any equipment under operating leases as of december  purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile or per shipment basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended  from for the same period in the increase is due to the combination of an increase in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by independent contractors during  and an off setting decrease in payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which experienced a decline as there was less freight to move via brokerage 
while overall brokerage revenue and purchased transportation services fell year over year from to  brokerage revenue increased in fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter a year ago 
at december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  the increase in our independent contractor fleet is primarily from the expansion of our drayage operations 

table of contents miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for  compared to for other income in the current year includes a  gain from insurance settlement for damage from a fire to one of our buildings 
we had no outstanding debt at december  or income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the small decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to lower state tax expense resulting from changes in our income allocated to the numerous states in which we operate 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe our relatively high variable costs as a percentage of revenue makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to million for  from million in the operating environment in was challenging and reflected broad based economic weakness across all industries 
price competition remained intense as carriers struggled to maintain equipment productivity 
typical seasonal shipping patterns did not hold as volumes were uncharacteristically weak toward the second half of the year 
as a result of excess capacity  our average miles per tractor decreased in combined with a improvement in average revenue per total mile  our average revenue per tractor per week decreased slightly to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in our non paid empty mile percent improved basis points  to in  from in we ended with  tractors  a decrease of tractors from salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in from in the increase is due to the combination of higher workers compensation costs and an increase in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
at december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in after reaching unprecedented record high fuel prices during most of  the fourth quarter provided some relief with falling fuel prices 
our fuel expense in decreased due to falling diesel prices combined with internal initiatives to improve fuel efficiency 
these initiatives enabled us to reduce idle times  reduce non revenue miles  improve driver fuel productivity  and control out of route miles 
we also maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   our fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the increase is mainly attributable to the fact that a higher percentage of our fleet was operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors  during the period 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 

table of contents insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for during  we saw meaningful benefits from continued improvement in insurance and claims expense 
we implemented throughout our service centers the smith systems training  which is the leader in professional driver training with hands on  behind the wheel  instructional training 
we believe such training and other management efforts have been instrumental factors in reducing the severity and frequency of accidents 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for and communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to in  from in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from in the increase is due to a higher percentage of our fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors  and a reduction in our leased revenue equipment in favor of owned revenue equipment 
lease expense for revenue equipment was near zero in  compared to for the same periods in as of december   we did not have any equipment under operating leases 
purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile or per shipment basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for the year ended  from for the same period in the slight decrease is due to the combination of a decrease in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by independent contractors  and an off setting increase in payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which has experienced considerable growth over the last year 
at december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  excluding purchased transportation activities from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in this category is mainly due to a million increase in bad debt expense in as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for we had no outstanding debt at december  or income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a reduction in excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  issuances of our common stock  and borrowings under our line of credit 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease for is primarily due to a decrease in deferred income taxes payable  due to book and tax depreciation timing differences  resulting in an increase in cash paid for current income taxes in  along with an increase in accounts receivable 
our capital expenditure excluding equipment sales decreased million in net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease is mainly due to a reduction in capital expenditures for revenue equipment in capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
excluding any acquisitions  we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately to million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million for the year ended the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a million reduction in payments to repurchase our common stock 
in  we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock  compared to million used to repurchase  shares of our common stock in cash dividends paid in the current year also increased approximately million  due to an increase in dividends paid to our shareholders 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share in the second quarter of at december   we had no outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit agreement and were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as of december  historically  during encouraging freight markets we have self funded our growth by purchasing equipment with the cash generated from our operations 
in  we did not see the right strategic opportunity to deploy capital 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder returns  including fleet growth  acquisitions  dividends  share repurchases  and other strategic options 
we believe that we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash  cash flows from operations  and borrowing available under our existing line of credit 
we will have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of available financing  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
in  we did not have any revenue equipment held under operating leases 
vehicles held under operating leases were not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments with respect to such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to revenue equipment leases was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also use operating leases to lease locations for certain of our service centers and for temporary trailer storage 
these operating leases have termination dates ranging from january through rental payments for such facilities and trailer storage are reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the line item miscellaneous operating expenses 
rental payments for our facilities and trailer storage totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in thousands due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other purchase obligations revenue equipment investment in transportation resource partners trp iii operating leases communication equipment operating leases buildings asc income tax obligations  including interest and penalties total at december   we did not have any purchase obligations for revenue equipment 
a portion of our purchase commitments for revenue equipment are currently under negotiation 
upon execution of the purchase commitments  we anticipate that purchase commitments under contract will have a net purchase price of approximately million and will be paid throughout the balance of our expected net capital expenditures has not yet been negotiated 
asc income tax obligations represent potential liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalty 
we are uncertain when this liability will be settled 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts  and using other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from zero to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
we both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than originally expected 
this determination is based upon i market conditions in equipment sales  ii the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuation in market value that is not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect in our results of operations 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present that indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss 
our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value 

table of contents claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves are adjusted quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention  we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed our coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  in accordance with asc income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management judgment also is required regarding a variety of other factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on our future performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we adopted the provisions of asc income taxes relating to uncertain tax positions  on january  further information related to the implementation is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based payments 
we have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options  which generally ranges between five to seven years 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model and management bases such decisions on historical data 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
we have service based restricted stock awards outstanding 
the compensation expense uses fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r under which we estimate the expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined mostly to the united states  we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
we believe that the majority of the fuel price increases are generally passed to our customers
