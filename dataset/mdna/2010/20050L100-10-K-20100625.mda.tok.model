critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and accounts of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   strategic security services  inc  rodgers police patrol  inc and command security services  inc  the company s three wholly owned subsidiaries  were merged with and into command security corporation 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates that we make include allowances for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  income tax assets and insurance reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we record revenues as services are provided to our customers 
revenues consist primarily of aviation and security services  which are typically billed at hourly rates 
these rates may vary depending on base  overtime and holiday time worked 
revenue for administrative services provided to other security companies are calculated as a percentage of the administrative service customer s revenue and are recognized when billings for the related security services are generated 
revenue is reported net of applicable taxes 
trade receivables we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of customer lists and borrowing costs that are being amortized on a straight line basis over three to ten years and goodwill which is reviewed annually for impairment 
the life assigned to customer lists acquired is based on management s estimate of the attrition rate 
the attrition rate is estimated based on historical contract longevity and management s operating experience 
we test for impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review  if sooner 
any potential impairment is evaluated based on anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and actual customer attrition in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment 
insurance reserves general liability estimated accrued liabilities are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
workers compensation annual premiums are based on the incurred losses as determined at the end of the coverage period  subject to minimum and maximum premium 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
income taxes income taxes are based on income loss for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability asset for the estimated taxes payable recoverable in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
in the event that interest and or penalties are assessed in connection with our tax filings  interest will be recorded as interest expense and penalties as selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation fasb asc  stock compensation  requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we were required to adopt the provisions of fasb asc effective july  and use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  we recognize compensation expense in our financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after july  the adoption of fasb asc resulted in non cash charges of   and  for stock based compensation for the years ended march   and  respectively 
overview we principally provide uniformed security officers and aviation services to commercial  residential  financial  industrial  aviation and governmental customers through more than company offices in states throughout the united states 
in conjunction with providing these services  we assume responsibility for a variety of functions  including recruiting  hiring  training and supervising all operating personnel as well as paying such personnel and providing them with uniforms  fringe benefits and workers compensation insurance 
our customer focused mission is to provide the best personalized supervision and management attention necessary to deliver timely and efficient security solutions so that our customers can operate in safe environments without disruption or loss 
technology underpins our efficiency  accuracy and dependability 
we use a sophisticated software system that integrates scheduling  payroll and billing functions  giving customers the benefit of customized programs using the personnel best suited to the job 
renewing and extending existing contracts and obtaining new contracts are crucial to our ability to generate revenues  earnings and cash flow 
in addition  our growth strategy involves the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses in order to increase our scale within certain geographical areas  capture market share in the markets in which we operate and improve our profitability 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities for contract security officer businesses 
we frequently evaluate acquisition opportunities and  at any given time  may be in various stages of due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect to a number of potential acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will identify any suitable acquisition candidates or  if identified  that we will be able to complete the acquisition of such candidates on favorable terms or at all 
we expect that security will continue to be a key area of focus both domestically in the united states and internationally

we have an insurance policy covering workers compensation claims in states in which we perform services 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
charges for estimated workers compensation related losses incurred and included in cost of sales were   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the nature of our business also subjects us to claims or litigation alleging that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others 
we insure against such claims and suits through general liability policies with third party insurance companies 
our insurance coverage limits are currently  per occurrence for non aviation related business with an additional excess umbrella policy of  and  per occurrence for aviation related business 
we retain the risk for the first  per occurrence on the non aviation related policy which includes airport wheelchair and electric cart operations  and  on the aviation related policy except for  for damage to aircraft and  for skycap operations 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on specific reserves in connection with existing claims as determined by third party risk management consultants and actuarial factors and the timing of reported claims 
these are all factored into estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to us 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  of revenues  from  of revenues in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher i administrative payroll and related costs of approximately  associated primarily with expanded operations  including the acquisitions in florida and new contract awards noted above  additional investment in our sales and marketing group and the hiring of our chief executive officer  ii facility and related office costs  iii insurance related costs and iv amortization costs associated with the acquisitions in florida in september  noted above

criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
we do not know if bad debts will increase in future periods nor does our management believe that the decrease during the fiscal year ended march  compared with the same period of the prior year is necessarily indicative of a trend 
bad debt recoveries bad debt recoveries for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by  to  from  in fiscal due mainly to the timing of recoveries related to accounts receivable previously recorded as bad debts

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  from  in fiscal due mainly to an increase in our pre tax earnings in the current year period

liquidity and capital resources we pay employees and administrative service customers on a weekly basis  while customers pay for services generally within days after billing by us 
in order to fund our payroll and operations  we maintain a commercial revolving loan arrangement  currently with wells fargo  to fund our payroll and operations 
our principal use of short term borrowings is for carrying accounts receivable 
our short term borrowings have supported the increase in accounts receivable associated with our ongoing expansion and organic growth 
we intend to continue to use our short term borrowings to support our working capital requirements 
we believe that our existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in our credit facilities or otherwise 
the failure by us to obtain such financing  if needed  would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cit revolving loan until march   we were parties to a financing agreement the agreement with cit that had a term of years ending december  and provided for borrowings in an amount up to of our eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement  but in no event more than  the agreement also provided for advances against unbilled revenue primarily monthly invoiced accounts although this benefit was offset by a reserve against all outstanding payroll checks 
borrowings under the agreement bore interest at the prime rate as defined in the agreement plus per annum on the greater of i  or ii the average of the net balances owed by us to cit in the loan account at the close of each day during the applicable month for which interest was calculated 
costs to close the loan totaled  and were amortized over the three year life of the agreement  as extended see below 
on march   we entered into an amended and restated financing agreement with cit the amended and restated agreement  which provided for borrowings as noted above  but in no event more that  the amended and restated agreement provided for a letter of credit sub line in an aggregate amount of up to  under the amended and restated agreement  letters of credit were subject to a two percent per annum fee on the face amount of each letter of credit 
the amended and restated agreement provided for interest to be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate as defined in the amended and restated agreement plus  if our ebitda as defined in the amended and restated agreement was equal to or less than  for the most recently completed fiscal quarter  otherwise  the outstanding principal balance bore interest at the prime rate 
for libor loans  interest was calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate as defined in the amended and restated agreement plus  if our ebitda was equal to or less than  for the most recently completed fiscal quarter  otherwise  the outstanding principal balance bore interest at the libor rate plus 
on april   we entered into an amendment to the amended and restated agreement the amended agreement 
under the amended agreement  the aggregate amount that we could borrow from cit under the credit facility was increased from  to  and cit also provided us with a  acquisition advance to fund the cash requirements associated with the acquisition of a security services business 
further  the amended agreement extended of the maturity date of this credit facility to december   reduced certain fees and availability reserves and increased the letter of credit sub line to an aggregate amount of up to  under the amended agreement  letters of credit were subject to a one and three quarters percent per annum fee on the fact amount of each letter of credit

for libor loans  interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate as defined in the amended agreement plus 
in addition  the company agreed to pay cit a fee the amendment fee in consideration for the extension provided to the company under this amendment in the amount of  the amendment fee was payable as follows i if the obligations as defined in the amended agreement were paid in full on or before january   the entire amendment fee shall be forgiven  ii if the obligations as defined in the amended agreement were not paid on or before january   a portion of the amendment fee in the amount of  must be paid on or before february   iii if the obligations as defined in the amended agreement were paid in full on or before february   then the unpaid balance of the amendment fee shall be forgiven  and iv if the obligations as defined in the amended agreement were not paid on or before february   then the unpaid balance of the amendment fee must be paid on or before march  wells fargo revolving loan on february   we entered into a new  credit facility with wells fargo the credit agreement 
this new credit facility  which matures in february  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
this new facility replaced our existing  revolving credit facility with cit  and was used to refinance outstanding indebtedness under that facility  to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and  thereafter  for working capital including acquisitions  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for a letter of credit sub line in an aggregate amount of up to  the credit agreement also provides for interest to be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 
for libor loans  interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 
as of march   the interest rates were and for revolving and libor loans under the credit agreement  respectively 
closing costs for the credit agreement totaled  and are being amortized over the three year life of the credit agreement 
as of march   we had borrowed  in libor loans and had approximately  letters of credit outstanding representing approximately of the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit agreement based on our eligible accounts receivable as defined under the credit agreement as of such date 
we rely on our revolving loan from wells fargo which contains a fixed charge covenant and various other financial and non financial covenants 
if we breach a covenant  wells fargo has the right to immediately request the repayment in full of all borrowings under the credit agreement  unless wells fargo waives the breach 
for the fiscal year ended march   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended march   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities investing we finance vehicle purchases typically over three years and insurance through short term borrowings 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures at this time 
financing during the fiscal year ended march   we increased our short term borrowings principally to support higher accounts receivable associated with our ongoing expansion and organic growth 
the company may obtain short term financing to meet its insurance needs 
for the fiscal year ended march    was borrowed for this purpose 
working capital working capital increased by  to  as of march   from  as of march  we experienced checks issued in advance of deposits defined as checks drawn in advance of future deposits of  as of march   compared with  at march  cash balances and book overdrafts can fluctuate materially from day to day depending on such factors as collections  timing of billing and payroll dates  and are covered via advances from the revolving loan as checks are presented for payment 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of march  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include an agreement to purchase uniform cleaning services that is legally binding on we and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
outlook financial results future revenues will be largely dependent upon our ability to gain additional business from new and existing customers in our security and aviation services divisions at acceptable margins while minimizing terminations of contracts with existing customers 
our security services division has started to experience both organic and transactional growth over recent quarters after a reduction over the past few years as contracts with unacceptable margins were cancelled 
our current focus is on increasing revenues while our sales and marketing team and branch managers work to develop new business and retain profitable contracts 
the airline industry continues to increase its demand for third party services provided by us  however  several of our airline customers have continued to reduce capacity within their system which results in reductions of service hours provided by us to such carriers 
additionally  our aviation services division is continually subject to government regulation  which has adversely affected us in the past with the federalization of the pre board screening services and the document verification process at several of our domestic airport locations 
we expect our gross profit margins to average between and of revenue for fiscal year based on current business conditions 
we expect gross profit to remain under pressure due primarily to continued price competition 
however  we expect these effects to be moderated by continued operational efficiencies resulting from better management and leveraging of our cost structures  improved workers compensation experience ratings  workflow process efficiencies associated with our integrated financial software system and higher contributions from our continuing new business development 
our cost reduction program is expected to reduce certain of our operating and general and administrative expenses in future periods 
additional cost reduction opportunities are being identified and will be pursued as they are determined 
the aviation services division represents approximately of our total revenues and delta  with annual billings of approximately  during fiscal  is the largest customer of our aviation services division representing  on an annual basis  approximately of the revenues from our aviation services division and of our total revenues 
the aviation industry continues to face various financial and other challenges  including the cost of security and higher fuel prices 
additional bankruptcy filings by aviation and non aviation customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
as described above on february   we entered into a new  credit facility the credit agreement with wells fargo 
as of the close of business on june   our cash availability was approximately  which we believe is sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in credit facilities or otherwise 
the financial markets generally  and the credit markets in particular  are and have been experiencing substantial turbulence and turmoil  and extreme volatility  both in the united states and  increasingly  in other markets worldwide 
the current market situation has resulted generally in substantial reductions in available loans to a broad spectrum of businesses  increased scrutiny by lenders of the credit worthiness of borrowers  more restrictive covenants imposed by lenders upon borrowers under credit and similar agreements and  in some cases  increased interest rates under commercial and other loans 
if we require alternative or additional financing at this or any other time  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available upon commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional financing when and if required by us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the fiscal year ended march   we did not hold a portfolio of securities instruments for either trading or speculative purposes 
periodically  we hold securities instruments for other than trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of market fluctuations 
we are exposed to market risk in connection with changes in interest rates  primarily in connection with outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo  which was entered into for purposes other than trading purposes 
based on our average outstanding balances during the fiscal year ended march   a change in the prime lending rate could impact our financial position and results of operations by approximately  over the next fiscal year
