risk factors statements in this report  or in our news releases  websites  public filings  investor and analyst conferences or elsewhere  which are not purely historical facts or which necessarily depend upon future events  including statements about trends  uncertainties  hopes  beliefs  anticipations  expectations  plans  intentions or strategies for the future  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward looking statements  including risks and uncertainties described below in item a 
risk factors 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date the statements are made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks associated with an investment in our securities  with our business and with our achieving any forward looking statements  include the risk factors described below 
any of these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or financial results and reduce the value of an investment in our securities 
we may not succeed in addressing these and other risks 
our email encryption business depends upon customers using email to exchange confidential information  and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our email encryption customers deploy and use our products and services to easily  securely and confidentially send and receive encrypted email messages 
our email encryption business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email to exchange sensitive information electronically 
new technologies or products  or new business models that could support secure communications  could be disruptive to our business 
if prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than ours  our growth prospects and our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
public key cryptography technology used in our businesses is subject to technology integrity risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our email encryption and e prescribing businesses employ public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by encryption depends on the integrity of the private key  which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
public reports of the successful decryption of encrypted messages or encrypted information could reduce demand for our products and services 
if new methods or technologies make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become unmarketable 
that could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could increase our costs  damage our reputation  or otherwise harm our business 
any of these events could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the growth of our business may require significant investment in systems and infrastructure with no guarantee of revenue  which could impair our profitability and negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
as our operations grow in size and scope  we may need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and pursuing reduced costs per transaction 
expanding our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase  which could reduce our net income  deplete our cash  and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we face strong and increasing competition  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the markets for our products and services are very competitive 
with rising demand for private and secure email communications  there is increasing competition to provide email encryption products and services 
our email encryption business competes with products and services offered by companies such as axway  cisco systems inc  datamotion  echoworx  emc corporation  mcafee  inc  pgp corporation  proofpoint  trend micro and voltage security 
increased competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers 
some of our competitors offer email encryption services together with products and services that we do not offer  which could make our offering less attractive by comparison 
our competitors may develop technology solutions and service offerings that are perceived by customers as equivalent to  or having advantages over  our products and services 
competitors could capture a significant share in our markets  causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly 
competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs 
increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services 
competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
some competitors have advantages that may allow them to compete more effectively than us  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  bigger product development and acquisition budgets  established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors  and greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
these resource advantages might enable them independently or through alliances to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can  to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can  or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours 
these advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we plan to increasingly rely on third party distributors to help us market our email encryption products and services  and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we plan to increase the distribution of our email encryption products and services by entering into alliances with third parties who can offer our products and services along with their own products and services 
increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks 
for example  we have limited control over the timing of the delivery of our products to customers by third party distributors  which could increase the length of our sales cycle  cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue 
we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances 
companies with which we have marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us  form marketing alliances with our competitors  or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours 
if a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us  we could experience a interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline 
our failure to develop  maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business substantially depends on market acceptance of our email encryption service  and our failure to achieve market penetration could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our revenue and financial results are increasingly dependent on our email encryption business 
in order to operate profitably  we must achieve broad market acceptance of our email encryption service at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs 
we have been successful in selling our products and services to various high profile customers  particularly in the healthcare  financial services and government segments of our market 
the acceptance and use of our email encryption products and services by those significant customers facilitates our sales to potential customers  and an expanding base of users in the zix directory aids in our market penetration and expansion 
we must continue to respond to evolving business models for technology offerings in order to achieve market acceptance 
the loss of an influential customer could impair our ability to expand the market penetration of our products and services  or cause us to reduce prices  which could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
unfavorable economic and political environments could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
adverse economic conditions in markets in which we operate can harm our business 
if economic growth in those markets is slow  or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost  current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases  including the deployment or expansion of our email encryption products and services 
this could result in reduced sales of our products and services  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers and distributors  which might result in failures or delays in payments to us 
this could increase our credit risk exposure and delay our recognition of revenue 
if these conditions remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
our failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and financial results 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements 
we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments  industry trends  certifications and standards 
for example we must expand our offerings for virtual computer environments and mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices 
we also must develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing  popular operating systems 
our business could be harmed by our competitors announcing or introducing new products and services that could be perceived by customers as superior to ours 
we spend considerable resources on technology research and development  but our research and development resources are more limited than many of our competitors 
unforeseen requirements in our e prescribing business could cause us to divert resources from our email encryption business 
our business substantially depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes and we may be unable to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis  or at all 
our enhancements to existing products and services  or our potential new products and services  may not receive customer acceptance 
our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis  to keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
if our products do not work properly  our business  financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected 
we produce complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software  that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments 
software may contain defects or bugs that can interfere with expected operations 
there can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects  which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services 
the product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect could be material to our operating results 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could cause us to divert resources from our email encryption business and could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service  negative publicity  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  lost revenue and increased expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
the infrastructure supporting our email encryption business may suffer capacity constraints and business interruptions that could cause us to lose customers  increase our operating costs and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business depends on our providing our customers reliable  real time access to our data centers and networks 
customers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  service outages  or insufficient capacity 
system capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business could cause interruptions  outages or delays in our services  or deterioration in their performance  or could impair our ability to process transactions 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our network or to timely increase capacity to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
system delays or interruptions may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties  which could result in our losing customers and revenues  or incurring liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
our email encryption business depends substantially on our data center facilities  and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
much of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in dallas and austin  texas and in the united kingdom 
our data centers might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities or war or other events 
computer viruses  denial of service attacks  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions affecting the internet or our systems might cause service interruptions  delays and loss of critical data  and could prevent us from providing our services 
problems affecting our systems might be expensive to remedy and could significantly diminish our reputation and prevent us from providing services 
an incident that interrupts our data center operations or our networks could result in loss of revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of resources  injury to our reputation  liability and increased costs 
we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all reasonably conceivable losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
outages or problems with systems and infrastructure supplied by third parties could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our businesses rely on third party suppliers of the global telecommunications infrastructure 
we use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers  our customers and end users of our services 
if those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable  real time access to our systems  we may be unable to gain or retain customers 
these suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems 
any of these outages or problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
problems with enforcing our intellectual property rights or using third party intellectual property could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce and may offer limited protection of our intellectual property rights against potential infringers 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
these patents or other proprietary rights might be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information may not prevent its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products 
some jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
even unmeritorious claims brought against our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships  and may have to be settled for significant amounts 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements 
our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop non infringing technology or license technology on commercially reasonable terms 
we may face risks from using open source software that could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
like many other software companies  we may use open source software in order to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively 
open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software 
we could lose the right to use the open source code if we fail to comply with the license obligations 
using open source code could also cause us to inadvertently infringe third party intellectual property rights 
we may fail to recruit and retain key personnel  which could impair our ability to meet key objectives 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace key personnel 
integrating new key personnel may be difficult and costly 
volatility  lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  virtually all of whom are compensated  in part  based on the performance of our stock price 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our usage of personal information  and inadvertent exposure of confidential information  could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
in our email encryption and e prescribing businesses  we collect  process  store  use and transmit large amounts of personally identifiable information about individuals  such as personal healthcare or financial information 
our handling of these types of data is increasingly subject to regulation around the world 
these regulations may result in conflicting requirements 
our business could be materially adversely affected if legal restrictions on the use of personally identifiable information are expanded or are interpreted in ways that conflict with our business practices or increase our costs 
unauthorized disclosure of personal information including through intrusion by a hacker or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties  remediation and other expenses  and damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
governmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non us markets could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption technology  such as our email encryption service  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our email encryption service to almost all countries  the list of countries to which we cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future 
in addition  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services such as ours 
the cost of compliance with us and other export laws  or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non us markets  could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion 
we face a variety of other legal and compliance risks 
if we or our distributors fail to comply with applicable law and regulations  we may become subject to penalties  fines or restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our financial performance could be erratic and asset impairments could negatively affect our financial condition and financial results 
although we generate adequate cash flow from operations and we expect to be profitable  we may not continue to produce sufficient cash flow or show a profit 
we have incurred significant operating losses in past years 
our liquidity and capital resources are limited 
we expect our e prescribing business will generate sufficient cash to offset its expenses as we wind it down during  but we could experience a revenue shortfall if our e prescribing customers do not renew their contracts as we have planned throughout our balance sheet reflects goodwill relating to our email encryption business  as well as other assets 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other assets to determine if their values have been impaired  which could require us to recognize a non cash charge to earnings 
any of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the market price of our securities could be volatile and our securities may decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition to stock price volatility related to our business performance  our stock price may fluctuate due to events affecting our industry or our competitors  as well as general economic and political conditions 
any of these circumstances could cause our securities to decline in value 
exercises of options and warrants for our common stock would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and could negatively affect the value of our securities 
we have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options  including options held by our employees 
the exercise of warrants or options  and the resulting issuance of additional shares of our common stock  would substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our current shareholders 
issuance or sales of those additional shares could cause our securities to decline in value 
our issuances of additional debt or equity securities could dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and could negatively affect the value of our securities 
we may issue additional debt or equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
those securities could be issued in public or private transactions  at or below the then prevailing market price of our securities 
in addition  we may grant our employees shares of our common stock and options to purchase those shares 
our issuance of additional securities could substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our current shareholders 
issuance or sales of those additional shares could cause our securities to decline in value

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we are a leader in providing secure  internet based applications in a saas model 
these applications connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner  enabling the use of the internet for applications requiring a high level of security in the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors 
our core competency is the ability to deliver these complex service offerings with a high level of availability  reliability  integrity  and particularly security 
we operate under two reporting segments  email encryption service email or email encryption and e prescribing service e prescribing where we offer these services on a subscription basis to our customers who subscribe to use the services for a specified term 
as stated in item business  we have announced our intention to exit the e prescribing business by december   following the completion of existing obligations associated with this business segment 
directly related to this wind down of operations  we made significant cost reductions and incurred severance expense during  both resulting from reductions in headcount 
for the year ended december   we improved on record performance in the prior year and achieved our best financial results to date 
a growth in revenue  gross margin and strong cash collections in the email business led to improved performance 
however  our e prescribing business continued incurring significant losses 
the cash flow we receive from our email business is supporting the cash needs of our e prescribing business  which consumed a significant amount of cash and has incurred operating losses 
we believe the decision to wind down the e prescribing business will significantly improve our financial performance due largely to the cost reductions implemented in for  we expect the e prescribing business to be breakeven or achieve a slight operating profit 
we primarily sell our email encryption service through direct sales and telesales 
we also use a network of resellers and other distribution partners  particularly other service providers seeking an encryption offering in an oem like relationship 
strategy and focus areas we credit the growth we experienced during to the continued development and growth of our email encryption subscription business 
the company seeks to build and maintain reliable revenue growth by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
after the years required to achieve critical mass in the email business with the subscription model combined with the decision to wind down the e prescribing business  we believe we entered a new phase of financial stability in the subscription model initially required large up front investment to establish the service  but over time  the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription and transaction fees  and incremental costs to add new users are relatively low 
we delivered several new service enhancements during for both our email and e prescribing segments 
for our email business  we completed new development related to enabling foreign language content transparency and multi language command flexibility  new service environments for new partners and product features  improvements designed to reduce special configuration requirements for zixgateway deployments including development of the technologies required to enable virtual machine flexibility  and other improvements including new customer facing reporting and upgrades to our email encryption audit software 
for e prescribing  we implemented major enhancements to formulary and benefits presentation and prescription renewal functions 
the enhancements to the e prescribing services will help to ensure a steady operating state on the platform during the final year of operation of this business segment 
we continue to balance the cash produced by our more mature segment  email encryption  with the cash required by our e prescribing segment 
operationally  our success is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders nyfo for the email encryption service  renewal rates for the email encryption service  total orders includes nyfo s  second and third years on multi year orders and renewals  our ability to increase business volume with minimal cost increases  and  successful wind down of the e prescribing service by meeting cost objectives while executing on existing customer obligations 
known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on our current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to achieve these key metrics 
our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services 
driven primarily by the growth of the email business combined with the cost reductions associated with the wind down of the e prescribing business  we have improved fundamentals in our cash flow performance despite the significant amount of costs associated with our strategic review of e prescribing 
for we were cash flow positive  following up on when we were cash flow positive for the first time in our history 
we will continue to place a strong emphasis on actions to improve our cash flow  while balancing the continuing need for investments in developing our service offerings 
see item a 
risk factors for more information on the risks relative to our operations and future prospects 
revenue revenue increased by in compared with our growth was driven by a increase in the revenue for our email encryption business where our successful subscription model yielded steady additions to the subscriber base coupled with a high rate of renewing existing customers 
the increase from our email segment was partially offset by a decrease in our e prescribing segment where we saw a reduction in our revenue primarily driven by lower transaction related fees and fewer deployments in and early compared to the prior twelve month period 
operating margins for the year ended  our gross margin of million increased compared with this increase was primarily driven by increased revenues from our email encryption segment on a largely fixed cost structure 
the reduction in gross margin attributable to the drop in our e prescribing revenue was partially offset by a corresponding lower cost of revenues resulting from cost reductions related to the wind down of that segment 
other financial highlights for email encryption  our sales backlog was million in  compared with at the end of for email encryption  our total orders for were million  an increase of from the total orders of million our deferred revenue at the end of was million  compared with million at the end of we generated cash flows from operations of million during our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were million at the end of  compared with million at the end of we maintained a strong renewal rate of for those eligible email encryption contracts that came up for renewal in the loss of annual revenue due to non renewal was approximately  we topped million user email addresses with our email encryption service  with an increased growth rate of approximately  new email addresses each week we announced our planned exit from the e prescribing business 
we are targeting december   as the official termination date for this segment critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue  loss from operations and net loss  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about complex matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition income taxes valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation costs for additional discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we must make significant management judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in an accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimates regarding revenue affect all of our operating geographies 
generally speaking  we develop  market and support applications that connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner 
our services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption and e prescribing subscription based services  various transaction fees and related professional services 
the majority of the revenues generated are through direct sales  however  our email encryption service employs a combination of direct sales and a network of resellers and other distribution partners 
under all product categories and distribution models  we recognize revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we are engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation  no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
both the email encryption and the e prescribing services are subscription based services 
providing these services includes delivering subscribed for software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
our email subscribers generally execute multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
subscription fees received from customers are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
some of our e prescribing services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs or when the predetermined usage levels have been achieved  and when the amounts are fixed and determinable 
we do not offer stand alone services 
further  our services primarily include manufacturer provided warranty provisions 
we recorded no warranty expense in any of the presented periods 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against most of our accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance  is valued at  and consists of  for us state income tax credits that are substantially certain of realization in because the underlying tax is not contingent on us profitability and  for a canadian deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense 
if we begin to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company previously recorded a  tax contingency liability related to tax year  and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged except for currency translation adjustments 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the  tax liability and  in other uncertain positions in  was approximately  included in this balance are tax positions which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets after classifying intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with finite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
we have intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  which became fully amortized in early following their costs being ratably amortized over their respective  estimated useful lives of three years 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization 
goodwill was  or of total assets at december  and and relates to our email encryption business 
our goodwill is not being amortized  but we do evaluate the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to  versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we have non qualified stock options outstanding to employees  directors  and third parties under various stock option plans 
the plans require the exercise price of options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the options  subject to termination of employment  generally expire ten years from the date of grant 
employee options generally vest pro rata and quarterly over three years 
option grants to employees  officers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in the applicable option agreements 
we currently use the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
for periods prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans 
our share based awards are limited to stock options

vs 
email encryption e prescribing total revenues email encryption revenue increases were driven primarily by our continual addition of new users to the subscriber base  while at the same time renewing a high percentage of existing subscribers whose subscriptions were up for renewal 
we measure additions to the subscriber base by nfyo  which is defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
nfyos and renewal percentages are summarized in the table below new first year order value renewal percentage lost revenue due to lost renewals we believe the decline in our renewal percentages has been the result of both the current state of the economy and of competition in this market 
reduced it budgets have forced some of our customers to consider cutting back on the renewal of our services  or in some cases to forego an email encryption solution altogether 
in other cases  competition has been the primary driver  manifesting either through lower prices or alternative solutions which bundle email encryption with anti spam and anti virus services 
our go to market model of selling involves primarily multiple year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
as a result  a high percentage of customers subscribe to the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
we expect this preference for a longer contract term by a high percentage of our customers to continue in  as we have priced our services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
our list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent in when compared with due to the economic downturn we have experienced some pricing pressure resulting in discount percentages off our list price during the periods shown above 
there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on our new orders and or renewal rates as previously discussed 
e prescribing the decrease in revenue between and was primarily related to three items lower transaction related fees after reaching the contractual cap with one customer in the first half of  fewer deployments in and early compared to the prior twelve month period  and a one time contract catch up that occurred in involving the achievement of deployment related metrics for a single customer contract 
the decrease in revenue between and was largely due to reaching the contractual cap for a single payor contract mentioned above 
a one time custom development project for a large clinic and a utilization bonus from one of our sponsors occurring in also contributed to the decrease in revenues when compared to additionally  the impact of fewer e prescribing deployments in approximately deployments in versus approximately  in contributed to the decline in deployment revenue year over year  but to a lesser extent 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in renewal revenues 
revenue outlook our revenue growth in is primarily expected to come from continued success in the email encryption business 
with our continued focus in email encryption on sectors such as healthcare  financial services  insurance and government  along with the increased use of indirect oem distribution channels  we expect to see the business increase its new first year order rate in and fuel a continued increase in our year over year revenue growth rate 
we have announced our intention to exit the e prescribing business  and expect our revenue for this segment to decline accordingly  to approximately to of the annual total 
backlog  orders  and deployments company wide backlog our end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that we expect to fully amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog is comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid net  and approximately  of unbilled contracts 
the backlog divided by segment is  for email encryption and  for e prescribing 
the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
email encryption orders total order input for email encryption in was  compared with  in total orders include customer orders that management separates into three components for measurement purposes contract renewals  nfyos  and in the case of new multi year contracts  the years beyond the first year of service 
the nfyos were  in and  in e prescribing we have targeted december   to exit the e prescribing business 
while we deployed approximately prescribers in versus approximately prescribers in  we do not expect to deploy a material number of physicians in we intend to limit any such deployments to add on requests to practices with existing pocketscript customers 
however  we are committed to fulfilling our contractual obligations through the end of and are also renewing end users for service during this period 
in some instances  our payor sponsors are continuing to fund these prescriber renewals  but generally we contract with the physicians to pay for their renewal themselves 
other sources of revenue include transaction and usage based fees 
we recognized  in total transaction and usage based fees in versus  in the decrease in fees was primarily due to reaching an upper invoicing limit associated with the usage based fees in a single payor contract in the first half of transaction fees are contingent on the number of prescribers using our e prescribing service 
as of december   approximately  active prescribers were using our service  compared to approximately  at year end one clinic accounted for approximately of the decrease in total active prescribers 
this large clinic had previously notified us that they would discontinue our e prescribing service in as they completed their migration to a full electronic medical record solution 
we expect to see further attrition to our number of active prescribers throughout as physicians at other practices determine what action to take in light of our announced exit from the e prescribing business 
cost of revenues the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the cost of revenues by product line 
variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
email encryption e prescribing total cost of revenues the cost of revenue improvement for the twelve months ended december   versus the twelve months ended december   resulted primarily from reduced e prescribing costs directly related to the low touch model adopted during the strategic review  the decline in deployment activity during the last half of and the subsequent wind down plan for this business unit 
these actions associated with the e prescribing business drove approximate year over year reductions in salaries and benefits  cost of contractors performing installations  lower expenses related to installed hardware devices  and lower allocation of shared expenses  such as corporate costs including insurance and facility costs and personnel related costs for employees who provide services for both lines of business 
these reductions were partially offset by increased severance costs associated with the e prescribing wind down of  and other net increases totaling approximately  these cost reductions were partially offset by a slight increase in email encryption costs  primarily associated with the costs of our united kingdom co location site accounting for approximately  of the increase in cost of revenues 
with the reductions in the e prescribing business  the email encryption business absorbed a larger percentage of shared customer service and the network operations center costs which were the primary contributors to the remaining cost increase for the email encryption business 
the cost of revenue improvement for the twelve months ended december   versus the twelve months ended december   resulted primarily from a reduced rate of e prescribing deployments 
new e prescribing deployments in were compared to  in additionally  despite higher email encryption revenue  the relatively fixed cost structure of the email encryption business model  combined with slightly lower cost of professional services and lower depreciation expense drove lower cost of revenue between periods for the email encryption product line 
email encryption email encryption s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support and the amortization of company owned  customer based computer appliances 
for email encryption  a significant portion of the total cost of revenues relates to the zixdata center  which currently has excess capacity 
accordingly  cost of revenues is relatively fixed in nature and is expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue 
e prescribing the company s low touch model adopted during the strategic review  the decline in deployment activity during the second half of and the subsequent decision to wind down the e prescribing business drove costs down in versus these reductions included reduced headcount  contracted installation personnel reductions  reduction in device costs and allocated shared costs as described above 
consistent with the wind down of the e prescribing business  we expect cost of revenues to decline in research and development expenses the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our research and development expenses variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
total research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits  and stock based compensation for our development staff  and other non people costs associated with improving our existing products and services and developing new products and services 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to resulted primarily from i a  increase in salaries and benefits resulting from increases in average headcount  ii an  increase in severance costs associated with the decline of our e prescribing business  iii a  increase in allocated it and occupancy costs due to increase in average headcount and iv an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by various small reductions in other expense associated with research and development activities 
new development activities included improvements in foreign language transparency and multi language flexibility  service environments designed to enable new business by building on our introduction of our data center in the united kingdom as well as other efficiency and integrity improvements to our product suite 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to was primarily attributable to i a  increase in salary and benefit expense resulting from an increase in average headcount and salary increases involving both product lines and ii a  increase in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by decreases in various other non people expenses associated with research and development activities 
new development activities included those related to significant e prescribing enhancements to formulary and benefits presentation and prescriber workflow  as well as the establishment of a united kingdom based data center for our email encryption business to support customers of our oem resellers 
for we plan on continued research and development investment in our email encryption products and expect research and development costs related to this product to increase while the costs associated with the e prescribing business will decrease consistent with the wind down of that business 
overall  we expect total research development costs to decrease in due to the impact of the wind down of the e prescribing business 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expenses variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
total selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  travel  stock based compensation and benefits for marketing  selling and executive and administrative personnel 
also included are costs associated with advertising and promotions as well as fees for professional services and other general corporate activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to reflected i a  increase in salaries and benefits related to severance costs  ii a  increase in professional fees and iii a  increase in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by i a  decrease in travel expenses and ii decreases in various other expenses associated with selling  marketing and corporate administrative activities 
the net increase in salaries and benefits of  described above included approximately  of non recurring severance expenses 
excluding these severance expenses  salaries and benefits declined year over year due to lower average headcount 
the increase in professional fees of  year over year included approximately  of non recurring expenses associated with the company s strategic review of the e prescribing business and subsequent wind down decision 
the remaining increase of approximately  resulted primarily from increased outside legal fees  much of which was incurred in the third quarter of following the departure of the company s general counsel 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during compared to reflected higher stock based compensation expense of approximately  partially offset by i an approximate  decrease in salary  benefit and commission expense for individuals performing selling  marketing and administrative activities due to a decrease in average headcount  ii a  decrease in professional fees and iii decreases in various other expenses related to sales and marketing activities 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for are expected to decrease compared to the levels due to lower average headcount and lower severance expenses 
customer deposit forfeiture in we recorded a  forfeiture of a customer deposit in accordance with a master services agreement  which was entered into in at the time of the mydoconline acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on impairment of operating lease in april we sublet our unoccupied office space in mason  ohio 
the terms of this agreement coincided with our original property lease  which expired in october we made rent payments throughout the sublease period in the amounts of   and  for years  and  respectively 
these amounts were partially offset by the receipt of sublease payments totaling   and  in years  and  respectively and recorded to other income 
interest expense interest expense for was  consisting of interest related to a license subscription promissory note payable 
we incurred no interest expense in interest expense for was  consisting of  for stated interest on notes and  for related discount amortization 
investment and other income investment and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreasing amounts in all years presented was primarily driven by lower interest rates 
income taxes our company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and in the canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of  we adopted a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company previously recorded a  tax contingency liability related to tax year  and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged except for currency translation adjustments 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the  tax liability and  in other uncertain positions in  was approximately  included in this balance are tax positions which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against most of our accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance  is  and consists of  for us state income tax credits that are substantially certain of realization in because the underlying tax is not contingent on us profitability and  for a canadian deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense 
if we begin to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement applicable to all income tax positions 
this includes the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income 
us tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for year canadian tax authorities have conducted no income tax examinations since our commencement of operations in net loss we experienced net losses of   and  in   and respectively 
the following table summarizes unusual components included in the net loss for these three years 
year ended december  unusual items customer deposit forfeiture non recurring severance payments loss on impairment of operating lease expenses related to the strategic review of the e prescribing business loss on extinguishment of convertible debt total unusual items liquidity and capital resources overview based on our performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  contractual obligations  commitments  future customer financings  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months 
we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and debt was  we operate two distinct business segments which are in different stages of their life cycle 
our email encryption segment is profitable and is growing in excess of a year 
our e prescribing segment is generating significant losses and we announced in a plan to exit this business during we expect the e prescribing business to be breakeven or slightly profitable in and we expect to wind down this business by december  for the year ended december   we improved on record performance in the prior year and achieved our best financial results to date 
a growth in revenue  gross margin and strong cash collections in the email business led to improved financial performance 
this improvement was primarily driven from increased revenues while holding our costs relatively flat 
we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future  and believe a significant portion of our spending is discretionary and flexible and that we have the ability to adjust overall cash spending to react  as needed  to any shortfalls in projected cash 
we believe the decision to wind down the e prescribing business will significantly improve the financial performance of this business unit due largely to the cost reductions implemented in for  we expect the e prescribing business to be breakeven or achieve a slight operating profit 
impact of current economic environment we expect access to capital markets to be restricted over the next twelve months and possibly longer should capital markets remain constrained 
although we anticipate funding our operations internally  if we are unable to do so  our ability to raise capital at costs that are similar to market offerings in recent years could be limited 
sources and uses of cash years ended december  net cash provided by used in operations net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities for  our primary source of liquidity from our operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers  accounts receivable from our customers  and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
in we benefited by  from the issuance of common stock to our employees in lieu of cash compensation 
we did not continue this practice in and do not expect to use this practice going forward 
related to our investing activities  we utilized  to purchase various computing equipment primarily to satisfy customer contracts 
approximately of these capital purchases were for computer servers for our email segment  which are required to deliver our services 
the cash provided from financing activities was due to the exercise of warrants 
we used  to fund a small promissory note associated with computer operating system licenses 
although we no longer have significant debt  we have historically used a significant amount of cash to fund debt obligations 
we do not expect such large funding obligations in the immediate foreseeable future 
options and warrants of zixcorp common stock we have significant warrants and options outstanding that are currently vested 
there is no assurance that any of these options and warrants will be exercised  therefore the extent of future cash inflow from additional warrant and option activity is not certain 
the following table summarizes the warrants and options that are outstanding as of december  the vested shares are a subset of the outstanding shares 
the value of the shares is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share 
summary of outstanding options and warrants vested shares total value of included in outstanding outstanding outstanding total value of exercise price range shares shares shares vested shares total liquidity summary based on our current budget plans  we believe we have adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for the next twelve months 
we have in the past expressed a lack of willingness  relative to other alternatives  to raise capital by issuing new shares of common stock given the recent low price of the company s common stock 
should business results not occur as planned  we would first utilize our existing cash resources and would also consider altering our business plan to augment our cash flow position through cost reduction measures  or other such actions 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in carrying out any of these measures should they become necessary 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have total contractual obligations over the next year of  and  over the next three years consisting of various operating office lease agreements 
a summary of our fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december   is as follows payments due by period total years operating leases license subscription note payable we have severance agreements with certain employees which would require us to pay approximately  if all such employees separated from employment with our company following a change of control  as defined in the severance agreements 
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in or beyond in october  the fasb issued guidance that provides principles for allocation of consideration among its multiple elements  allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement 
the guidance introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available  and significantly expands related disclosure requirements 
it is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  alternatively  adoption may be on a retrospective basis  and early application is permitted 
the potential impact of this standard is being evaluated 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or footnote disclosures 
international financial reporting standards ifrs on august   the us securities and exchange commission sec announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  we could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs  and the sec is expected to make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we face material market risk with respect to our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash investments  which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
we held  in marketable securities as of december   and held no marketable securities as of december  at december   we had a  non interest bearing note payable with an imputed interest rate of see note to the consolidated financial statements
