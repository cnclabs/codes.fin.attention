executive summary we are a global technology driven growth company serving the oil  gas  and mining industries by providing oilfield products  services and equipment 
we operate in select domestic and international markets including the gulf coast  the southwest and the rocky mountains  northeastern and mid continental united states  canada  mexico  central america  south america  europe  africa and asia 
we market our products domestically and internationally in over countries 
the customers for our products and services include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies  pressure pumping service companies and state owned national oil companies 
our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our ability to differentiate our products and services  provide superior quality and service  and maintain a competitive cost structure 
our operations are driven primarily by natural gas and to a lesser extent oil well drilling activity  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of work over activity in north america 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of natural gas and crude oil and the volatility and expectations of future natural gas and oil prices 
our results of operations also depend heavily on the pricing we receive from our customers  which depends on activity levels  availability of equipment and other resources  and competitive pressures 
these market factors often lead to volatility in our revenue and profitability

demand for our services in the united states and canada is driven primarily by natural gas and to a lesser extent oil drilling activity  which tends to be extremely volatile  depending on the current and anticipated prices of crude oil and natural gas 
during the last ten years  the lowest average annual us rig count was in and 
table of contents the highest average annual us rig count was  in with the decline and volatility of natural gas and oil prices in  tightening and uncertainty in the credit markets and the global economic slowdown  drilling rig activity in north america declined significantly 
the average active north american rig count declined in as compared to the weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early october continued throughout the slowdown in the economy  particularly the industrial sector  coupled with the successful production results in the unconventional shale and tight sands plays in the us led to a natural gas oversupply situation  which negatively impacted natural gas price forecasts 
this in turn reduced the return potential of drilling projects causing less drilling activity as exploration and production e p companies slashed their capital budgets 
oil prices showed some resilience toward the end of  however our business is more dependent on the north american gas markets than oil markets 
therefore  the recovery of oil prices toward the end of did little to support a significant improvement in our business performance 
in total  this translated into lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services throughout north america 
late in the fourth quarter of  we began to take actions to scale our business to cope with these factors by implementing various cost containment actions such as deferring employee salaries  reducing travel levels  suspending the k match  and eliminating any non essential discretionary expenditures 
early in  we took actions to size the workforce to our expected near term work load  resulting in headcount reductions  including contract employees and full and part time employees 
in conjunction with the market downturn  we decreased inventory levels and took advantage of declining raw material prices to meet our customers demand for competitive pricing 
our drilling products segment is tied closely to rig count  especially vertical rigs  and the significant reductions in rig count had an adverse effect on our business 
despite these pressures we were able to maintain our market share through service quality  product innovation  and competitive bundling of product offerings 
the sharp drop in natural gas and oil prices in the latter part of resulted in lower drilling activity  higher inventories  and further market erosion in as a result of a worldwide economic slowdown which led to a rapid and substantial reduction in exploration and production expenditures 
in addition  margins were under significant pressure as customers sought lower prices for oilfield services and we  in turn sought price reductions from our suppliers 
forecasting the depth and length of the current cycle is challenging  as it is different from past cycles due to the overlay of the worldwide financial crisis in combination with broad demand weakness 
during the fourth quarter of  us drilling rig count averaged  as compared to in the third quarter  an increase of 
while we expect to see continued increases in us drilling activity in  the timing and magnitude of the increase remains uncertain 
the acceleration of drilling activity is influenced by a number of factors including commodity prices  global demand for oil and natural gas  supply and depletion rates of oil and natural gas reserves  as well as broader variables such as government monetary and fiscal policy 
the oil field services sector seems to have experienced its low point early in the third quarter of our business stabilized and the cost containment measures that we implemented in late and early began to take effect 
rig activity in north america began to improve toward the latter part of as gas price forecasts improved as the supply overages began to shrink as a result of some improvement in the economy and colder than normal temperature forecasts 
we expect that these improved economic conditions will continue throughout as e p companies outlooks improve with these higher expected gas prices  we expect this will lead to increased capital budgets for drilling and completion activities 
oil prices have currently stabilized and this should continue to add rig count in the oil basins which should help improve our drilling products revenue and lead to margin relief on pricing 
we expect the north american gas market activity will continue to see increases in the unconventional plays such as the barnett  haynesville  marcellus and other basins where our drilling tools are utilized 
our chemical additives enhance performance when added to fracturing fluids utilized in this type drilling 
our chemicals and logistics segment is also tied to rig counts  especially horizontal drilling rigs 
we also expect to see additional international opportunities in  particularly in our chemical and mwd business units 

table of contents our business is comprised of three reportable segments chemicals and logistics  drilling products and artificial lift 
we focus on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our chemicals and logistics and drilling products segments  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our artificial lift and chemicals and logistics segments 
we believe that our product offerings and geographical presence throughout these three business segments provides us with diverse sources of cash flow 
each segment has its own technical expertise and a common commitment to provide its customers with competitively priced quality equipment and services 
the chemicals and logistics segment develops  manufactures and markets specialty chemicals used in oil and gas well cementing  stimulation  acidizing  drilling and production treatment 
additionally  the segment provides well cementing  bulk blending and transload services and transload facility management services 
the drilling products segment rents  inspects  manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment for the energy  mining  water well and industrial drilling sectors 
the artificial lift segment assembles and markets artificial lift equipment which includes the petrovalve line of rod pump components  electric submersible pumps  and gas separators  valves and services to support coal bed methane production 
over the past three years  we have grown both organically and through strategic acquisitions and other investments in complementary or competing businesses in an effort to expand our product offering and geographic presence in key markets 
we strive to mitigate cyclical risk in the oilfield service sector by balancing our operations between drilling versus production  rental tools versus service  domestic versus international  and natural gas versus crude oil 
the acquisitions we completed in the preceding three years include teledrift  inc teledrift  which designs and manufactures wireless survey and measurement while drilling tools in february  sooner energy services  inc sooner  which develops  produces and distributes specialty chemical products and services for drilling and production of natural gas in august  a partnership interest in cavo drilling motors  ltd  co  cavo  which specializes in the rental  service and sale of high performance mud motors in january  and the remaining partnership interest in november  triumph drilling tools  inc triumph  a drilling tool sales and rental provider in texas  new mexico  louisiana  oklahoma and arkansas  in january  non cash impairment we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of every year and on an interim basis if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
testing of goodwill requires an assessment of the current business environment  future economic market indicators  expectations surrounding our future performance  the cost of working capital  projected revenue and operating margins  assessment of market and industry risk rates  and recognition of changes in these variables which may indicate the potential existence of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any 
during the quarter ended june   we identified certain triggering events resulting from the continued downturn in the then current business environment 
this assessment impacted and lowered forecasted earning potential of our reporting units from that previously estimated at december  accordingly  we recorded a goodwill pre tax impairment charge of million relating to our teledrift reporting unit during the six months ended june  
table of contents as our current economic climate continues to be weak  we incorporated into our annual impairment assessment  and our full year forecast  a measure of the recessionary environment of the second half of we anticipate a continued challenging environment for the first half of  followed by a slight recovery in the latter half of we anticipate benefits from a re leveraging of sales in the second half of and early the continued unfavorable business environment  volatile economic downturn continuing during the latter half of  low rig count projections  and uncertainty as to the recovery of the global economy  have contributed to conservative projected cash flows and higher risk adjusted discount rates used in our current annual assessment as compared to those used in our interim and annual assessments 
we believe cost containment actions taken in late and throughout were successful 
these included closing certain operating locations  curtailing capital expenditures  reducing costs through reductions in personnel levels  discontinuing our k matching  and focusing on our cost margin management 
we emphasized collection of customer receivables and inventory management 
this helped ensure preservation of the economic value of our businesses 
through our analyses  we determined that the fair value of reporting units exceeded the goodwill carrying value 
accordingly  we determined no further impairment charges were necessary as part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
we utilize a combination of a market approach and a present value discounted cash flow valuation technique to measure the fair value of the goodwill of our reporting units 
the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received from selling the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
the market approach is dependent upon market data of comparable public entities with operations and metrics similar to those of our operating segments 
if quoted market prices or market indicators are not available  we include a fair value estimate in our assessment which incorporates valuation techniques based on a weighted average cost of capital and multiple of after tax cash flows attributed to the reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted to a present value using risk adjusted discount rates over a period of expected future returns 
this income approach valuation technique is consistent with the objective of fair value measurements and is consistent with the methodology applied in our previous assessments 
the income approach is dependent on our weighted average cost of capital and our forecasted operating results and future cash flows 
therefore  we consider available and relevant market multiple measures along with the estimated and expected future cash flows of our reporting units to determine fair value

table of contents results for compared to consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the same period in revenue decreased in all three of our segments as decreases in petroleum and natural gas prices drove down rig counts and related drilling activity  negatively affecting volume in all segments 
in addition  pricing pressures drove down revenues as customers moved to less expensive products where possible 
consolidated gross margin decreased million 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  from in due primarily to margin compression in the drilling products segment and segment direct expenses  that while reduced million  decreased at a lower rate than revenue 
gross margin is calculated as revenue less the corresponding cost of revenue  which includes personnel  occupancy  depreciation and other expenses directly associated with the generation of revenue 
selling  general and administrative costs are not directly attributable to products sold or services rendered 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in indirect personnel and personnel related costs and professional fees due to cost containment efforts 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction of amortizable intangible assets as a result of the asset impairment recorded in research and development r d costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in r d costs in the chemicals and logistics segment were and of total r d expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate r d spending levels to remain consistent with expenditures 
r d expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
in the second quarter of  we recorded goodwill impairment of approximately million related to the teledrift reporting unit 
no additional impairment was recorded as part of management s annual assessment of goodwill 
management believes its cost structure is appropriate for its forecast level of activity and does not foresee significant adjustments  however  changes in market demands or forecast may cause management to further reduce headcount or carry out additional cost containment efforts 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  versus million in the increase was primarily related to accretion of the debt discount recorded effective january  associated with adoption of a new accounting principle 
an income tax provision of million was recorded for the year ended december   reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december   reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the change in our effective tax rate is primarily due to an million valuation allowance recorded in against the deferred tax assets of one of our filing jurisdictions 
in addition  the impairment had a million impact on our tax provision and there was no similar impact in results for compared to consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in revenue increased in all three of our segments as we experienced 
table of contents organic growth greater than when compared to the previous year with the remainder of the growth coming from our acquisition of teledrift 
the organic revenue growth is primarily a result of an increase in overall sales volume  particularly of our patented micro emulsion chemicals  tool rentals  service inspections and expansion of our mud motor fleet 
sales of our patented micro emulsion chemicals grew  to million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat between both periods at approximately  of revenues 
we actively managed our gross margin through targeted price increases and cost containment measures to offset increasing raw material prices throughout the year 
we continued to experience greater volumes within our higher margin chemicals and logistics segment and volumes related to the teledrift acquisition 
sales of our patented micro emulsion chemicals  which sell at higher margins  made up of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million for the same period in excluding the teledrift acquisition  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in indirect personnel  office and occupancy costs in all divisions as we shifted into the more people intensive rental and service business  expanded geographically and expanded our sales and corporate support staff 
the acquisition of teledrift accounted for million of the total increase  and professional fees increased million due to higher administration and management costs  which were incurred to strengthen back office functions and internal controls 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to higher depreciation associated with acquired assets and expanded capital expenditures 
research and development costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in in we expanded our r d investments in the chemicals and logistics segment by approximately 
r d expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
we impaired the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets based on management s evaluation of the company s sustained low stock price and reduced market capitalization  macroeconomic factors impacting industry conditions  actual recent results and forecasted operating performance  as well as other factors 
the company determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeded the estimated fair value of certain reporting units and intangible assets  and  as a result  recorded an impairment of million at december  loss from operations was million for the year in compared to income from operations of million for the year in interest expense was million for the year ended december  versus million for the same period in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in the amount of million used to finance the teledrift acquisition  non cash interest expense related to the application of asc  debt with conversion and other options  and pay down amounts previously outstanding under our senior credit facility 
additionally  we amortized debt fees related to our financing agreements throughout that amounted to approximately million 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was for the year ended december  versus for the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to impairment charges and a shift in income by jurisdiction 
the impairment had a million impact on our tax provision 

table of contents results by segment chemicals and logistics dollars in thousands years ended december  revenue gross margin gross margin income from operations income from operations results for compared to chemicals and logistics chemicals and logistics revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in chemicals and logistics revenue was primarily due to a reduction in volume as a result of lower crude and natural gas prices driving a steep drop in rig activity and well fracturing activities 
in addition  pricing pressures drove customers to lower priced products resulting in a decrease in average sales dollars per unit sold 
sales of our patented micro emulsion chemicals declined to million 
demand for micro emulsion chemicals is driven by various market forces including the fact that micro emulsion chemicals have a higher per unit cost 
gross margin decreased million due primarily to reductions in revenue and a slight reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from to 
product margins as a percentage of product revenue remained flat 
field direct expenses as a percentage of segment revenue increased to from as revenue decreased at a higher rate than reductions made due to cost containment efforts 
chemical product costs can fluctuate significantly with the price of petroleum and we generally do not lead the market in pricing  therefore  product margins are subject to market and cost fluctuations 
we cannot be assured of passing on timely price increases  however  we believe our margins will fluctuate consistent with other market participants 
income from operations was million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately compared to the same period in income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  field indirect costs decreased by million or due primarily to cost containment efforts  however  reductions did not keep pace with revenue decreases and field indirect costs increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
results for compared to chemicals and logistics chemicals and logistics revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a million increase in sales of our patented micro emulsion chemicals  an increase of million due to the sooner energy services  inc acquisition  and a million increase in services revenue 
the increases were offset by a million decrease in sales of the remainder of our chemical business as those products became commoditized due to increased competition 
we also instituted a price increase in the first quarter of that we maintained for most of the year 
however  in the second half of the year our margins declined as a result of rising raw material costs 
sales of micro emulsion chemicals grew  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in as a result of increased fracturing activities and wider acceptance of our micro emulsion products by independent pressure pumping companies as well as the majors 

table of contents income from operations was million for the year ended december   approximately higher than the same period in income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  the rising cost of raw materials petroleum based feedstock reduced our operating profit 
we partially offset this cost increase through targeted price increases for certain products 
we also made investments related to a new research and development facility and for our international initiative 
as a result of the declining market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of  we began to institute measures to size the organization to the current marketplace 
we relocated one production chemical manufacturing facility 
as a technology driven company  we remained active in our research and development efforts by maintaining these costs at current levels as a percentage of revenues 
we anticipated increased price pressures from our customers within the marketplace and focused our attention on margin protection through management of both raw materials and fixed costs  in addition to technology innovations 
drilling products dollars in thousands years ended december  revenue gross margin gross margin income loss from operations income loss from operations results for compared to drilling products drilling products revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue as compared to was primarily due to decreased demand for our products and services commensurate with the reduction in rig count in north america 
reductions in volume were experienced in all product lines and nearly all products 
in addition  an oversupply of tools available for rent or sale by the company and in the market due to the economic slowdown created pricing pressures reducing revenue on a per rental basis 
gross margin decreased million due to reductions in revenue and margins 
product and rental gross margins as a percentage of related revenue decreased to in from in  accounting for a million relative decrease in gross margin  primarily due to market pricing pressures 
field direct costs decreased by million or due primarily to cost containment efforts  however  due to lower revenues  those costs increased as a percentage of segment revenue to from 
in addition  inventory adjustments  which related primarily to increased inventory reserves  increased million as compared to loss from operations was million in  a decrease of million or as compared to the smaller loss is primarily due to a decrease in impairment to million in from million in  offset by the decrease in gross margin
