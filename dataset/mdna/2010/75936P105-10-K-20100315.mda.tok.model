item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k

the company s primary business is providing commercial real estate market information and analytical tools for its customers  through its reis services subsidiary 
for disclosure and financial reporting purposes  this business is referred to as the reis services segment 
reis services s historic business reis services  including its predecessors  was founded in reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the us the database contains information on apartment  office  retail and industrial properties and is used by real estate investors  lenders and other professionals to make informed buying  selling and financing decisions

reis continues to develop and introduce new products  expand and add new markets and data  and find new ways to deliver existing information to meet and anticipate client demand 
wellsford s historic business the company was originally formed on january  reis acquired the reis services business by merger in may  which we refer to as the merger 
prior to may  reis operated as wellsford real properties  inc  which we refer to as wellsford 
wellsford s primary operating activities immediately prior to the merger were the development  construction and sale of its three residential projects and its approximate ownership interest in the reis services business 
the company completed the sale of the remaining units at its colorado project in september and sold its claverack  new york project in february in addition  the company ceased building new homes in and is seeking to exit the residential development business by selling its east lyme  connecticut project in bulk  in order to focus s olely on the reis services business 
residential development activities at december   the company s residential development activities were comprised of the following the orchards  a single family home development in east lyme  connecticut  upon which the company could build single family homes on acres  which we refer to as east lyme 
sales commenced in june and an aggregate of homes and lots homes and lots were sold as of december  at december   the remaining inventory included one home  two improved lots and fully approved lots 
the stewardship  a single family home development in claverack  new york  which is subdivided into developable single family home lots on acres and includes two model homes and substantially completed infrastructure and amenities  which we refer to as claverack 
on february   this property was sold 
the company is working with local and regional brokers related to the east lyme bulk sale initiative 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell the home in inventory  or any or all of the remaining lots  individually or in bulk  at acceptable prices  or within a specific time period  or at all 
none of the company s remaining real estate assets is encumbered by debt 
unsolicited offers and board rejections on june   costar made an initial  non public  unsolicited offer to acquire the company for per share in cash  which was rejected by the board on june  on august   the board rejected a second unsolicited proposal by costar  which it made public  to acquire the company for the same per share price 
in the view of the board  the price offered in the costar proposals was inadequate as it was below the long term value reis could realize for its stockholders by the pursuit of its business as an independent entity and the continued disposition of its real estate assets  or by an organized sale of the company 
on october   costar publicly announced on its quarterly conference call that it was formally withdrawing its offer 
selected significant accounting policies management has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
intangible assets  amortization and impairment web site development costs the company expenses all internet web site costs incurred during the preliminary project stage 
thereafter  all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives  not exceeding three years 
the value ascribed to the web site development intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
amortization of all capitalized web site development costs is charged to product development expense 
database costs the company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over a three or five year period 
costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred 
the value ascribed to the database intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three or five years 
amortization of all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales 
customer relationships the value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the merger is amortized over years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense 
lease value the value ascribed to the below market terms of the office lease existing at the time of the merger is amortized over the remaining term of the acquired office lease which was approximately nine years 
amortization is charged to general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or after a triggering event has occurred  requiring such a calculation 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a second step is required to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
there was no go odwill impairment identified in or intangible assets  with determinable useful lives  are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in addition  the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
an impairment charge would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
there was no intangible asset impairment identified in or goodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets recorded at the time of the merger are not deductible for income tax purposes  as a result of the tax treatment of the merger 
real estate and impairment costs directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate are capitalized  including interest and other costs incurred during the construction period 
ordinary repairs  maintenance and project operating costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has historically reviewed its real estate assets for impairment i whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for assets held for use and ii when a determination is made to sell an asset or investment 
if estimated cash flows on an undiscounted basis are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over estimated fair value is recognized 
the company recorded impairment charges aggregating approximately  in december  which is reflected as a component of cost of sales on the statements of operations 
no impairment charges were recorded during related to the company s real estate assets 
the company s operations relating to the sale of its remaining residential developments have been negatively impacted by the national  regional and local market conditions 
the timing of future sales by the company could be adversely impacted by the availability of credit to potential buyers 
further deterioration in market conditions  or other factors  may result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
revenue recognition and related items the company s subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web based services and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period  which is typically one year but can be as long as months 
revenues from ad hoc and custom reports or projects are recognized as completed and delivered to the customers  provided that no significant company obligations remain 
deferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract  which will be recognized in future periods 
if a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract  any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount  after considering any recovery of accounts receivable  is charged to cos t of sales 
cost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the company s researchers who collect and analyze the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the company s information services 
additionally  cost of sales includes the amortization of database technology 
sales of real estate assets  including condominium units  single family homes and sales of lots individually or in bulk are recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
the percentage of completion method was not used for recording sales on condominium units as down payments were nominal and collectability of the sales price from such a deposit was not reasonably assured until closing 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 
the company evaluates its tax positions in accordance with applicable current accounting literature 
recognition of uncertain tax positions step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position 
critical business metrics of the reis services business management considers certain metrics in evaluating the performance of the reis services business 
these metrics are revenue  ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin 
following is a presentation of these historical metrics for the reis services business for a reconciliation of gaap net income loss to ebitda for the reis services segment and to adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here  see below 
amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the three months ended december  percentage decrease decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the three months ended percentage increase decrease december  september  increase decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the years ended december  percentage decrease decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin reis services s revenue and ebitda decreased by approximately  and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   ebitda decreased  primarily as a result of a revenue reduction between the two periods of  the  decline in ebitda in consecutive quarters third quarter to fourth quarter is primarily the result of an increase in sales and marketing expenses between the two periods as a result of an increase in commissions and bonuses earned from sales in the fourth quarter 
however  even with the reported declines in ebitda  we have been able to maintain our ebitda margins in excess of through the significant cost control measures initiated in the fourth quarter of and in place during the periods 
the fourth quarter of was the company s best quarter for contracts signed since the fourth quarter of these contracts represent the dollar value of subscriptions for the first months of each contract 
generally  contracts will be turned into revenue over the following months 
the impact of fourth quarter contracts on revenue in the fourth quarter was minimal 
the net effect of price increases and decreases on renewals negatively impacted full year revenue 
beginning in september  contract price increases on renewals were constrained due to usage reductions at certain customers as well as budgetary pressures  predominantly among customers in the banking industry 
our pricing model is based on actual and projected usage  we believe it is generally not as susceptible to downturns and personnel reductions at our customers as a model based upon individual user licenses 
we generally impose contractual restrictions limiting our immediate exposure to revenue reductions due to mergers and consolidations 
however  we have been and we may in the future be impacted by cons olidation among our customers and potential customers  or in the event that customers enter bankruptcy or otherwise go out of business 
the revenue decreases referred to above are driven by the cumulative impact of declines in reis services s renewal rates over the past months 
our overall renewal rate was for the year ended december   up from for the twelve months ended september  and approaching the overall renewal rate of for the year ended december  the increase in the trailing twelve month renewal rate was driven by an increase in the quarterly renewal rate  which improved from overall and for institutional customers in the second quarter of to overall and for institutional customers in the third quarter of and further improved in the fourth quarter of to overall and for institutional customers 
this consecutive quarter over quarter increase in renewal rates was the first such increase since the beginning of the market downturn in as noted above  there is a delay between these positive changes in renewal rates and contract signings and the recognition of revenue from those contracts in reis services s statements of operations 
as stated above  the fourth quarter of was the company s strongest quarter for contract signings since reis s revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms 
reis recognizes revenue from its contracts on a ratable basis  for example  one twelfth of the value of a one year contract is recognized monthly 
therefore  increases in the dollar volume of new contracts will not translate immediately into equivalent increases in revenue 
similarly it took four quarters to realize the full impact of contract declines on revenue 
see the summarized consolidated quarterly information in note of the accompanying consolidated financial s tatements for the trajectory of revenue over the past two years 
the revenue decline appears to have stabilized in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of as revenue increased a modest  continued growth in contracts  like that experienced in the fourth quarter  would result in a return to revenue growth within the next few quarters 
during the year ended december   our bad debt expense aggregated  or only of annual revenue 
deferred revenue as reported of approximately  at december   represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and or received payments from our customers related to services the company will provide in the future 
it does not include an additional approximately  of revenue under non cancellable contracts for which the company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at december   but will be billed primarily over the next twelve months 
no individual customer accounted for more than and of reis services s revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
reconciliations of net loss income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  impairment losses on real estate assets and stock based compensation 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate metrics that may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the company s business from year to year o r period to period  as applicable 
further  these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes and  in the case of adjusted ebitda  isolates non cash charges for impairment losses on real estate assets and stock based compensation 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in reis services s type of business 
however  investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income loss  operating income loss  or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

see critical business metrics of the reis services business for a discuss ion of the variances and trends in revenue and ebitda of the reis services segment 
revenue and cost of sales of residential units were approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended december  with respect to the sale of the remaining condominium units at the gold peak development  thereby completing our sales activity for that project  and six east lyme sales three homes and three lots 
revenue and cost of sales of residential units were approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended december  with respect to the sale of condominium units at the gold peak development and six homes and eight lots at east lyme during the period 
sales of our residential units declined due to i the completion of sales at gold peak  ii depressed conditions generally and in our markets specifically  relating to sales of residential properti es and iii our determination to cease building homes in which not only reduces the number of sales but leads to lower sales prices and related cost of sales the sales prices for lots are substantially lower than those for completed homes 
the company recorded impairment charges aggregating approximately  in december  which is reflected as a component of cost of sales on the statements of operations 
the december impairment charges were  in general  the result of continuing deteriorating market conditions in the fourth quarter of and management s expectations for the future 
sales and marketing expenses and product development expenses were approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended december  and solely represent the costs of the reis services segment 
amortization expense included in sales and marketing expenses for the customer relationships intangible asset and product development expenses for the web site intangible asset was approximately  and  respectively  during this period 
sales and marketing expenses and product development expenses were approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended december  amortization expense included in sales and marketing expenses and product development expenses was approximately  and  respectively during this period 
the increase in sales and m arketing expense in the current period primarily reflects the effect of additional incentive compensation primarily driven by the strong sales performance in the fourth quarter of the reduction in product development expenses is the result of company wide cost cutting measures in property operating expenses were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  and represent the non capitalizable project costs and other period expenses related to the company s residential development projects 
these costs decreased as a result of the gold peak sell out in september and the efforts to reduce operating costs at our other projects in anticipation of selling them in bulk transactions 
general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  include current period expenses of  depreciation and amortization expense of  for lease value and furniture  fixtures and equipment  and approximately  of net non cash compensation expense 
the net non cash compensation expense is comprised of i compensation expense resulting from equity awards for employees and directors of approximately  and ii additional expense of approximately  from the increase in the reserve for option liability due to an increase in the market price of the company s common stock from per share at december  to per share at december  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  includ e current period expenses of  depreciation and amortization expense of  for lease value and furniture  fixtures and equipment  and approximately  of net non cash compensation expense  offset by the reversal of  of previously reserved unrecognized tax benefits 
the net non cash compensation expense is comprised of i compensation expense resulting from equity awards for employees and directors of approximately  offset by ii an approximate  decrease in the reserve for option liability due to a decrease in the market price of the company s common stock from per share at december  to per share at december  and options settled at an amount less than per share during the period 
also included in the year ended december  is approximately  of legal and investment banking fees incurred with regards to assessing and responding to the unsolicited offers to acquire reis and assessing stra tegic alternatives 
excluding the non cash items  the reduction in general and administrative expenses is a result of concerted efforts to reduce public company and other administrative costs  a reduction in staffing for management and accounting personnel who supported the residential development activities segment  but for which the costs were not allocable to that segment  the termination of the lease for the wellsford corporate office space in the third quarter of and other cost saving measures 
interest and other income was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  and primarily reflects interest earned on cash 
interest rates in the period were significantly lower than in the period 
interest expense of  for the year ended december  includes interest and cost amortization on the bank loan of  non capitalized interest relating to residential development activities of  and interest from other debt of  interest expense of  for the year ended december  includes interest and cost amortization on the bank loan of  non capitalized interest from residential development activities of  interest from other debt of  and a decrease in the fair value of the interest rate cap for the bank loan of  offset by the effect of the capitalization of interest of  from the bank loan to residential developments in accordance with existing accounting rules 
the decreases in interest expense resulted from substantially lower interest rates  as well as substantial reductions in the case of the bank loan or eliminations in the case of our residential property development debt in the principal amount of outstanding debt obligations 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  of  results from current state and local taxes of  offset by a net current federal alternative minimum tax amt benefit of  the income tax benefit during the year ended december  of  results from a change in estimate of nols allocable for income tax purposes to the fiscal period subsequent to the merger of  and deferred federal and state tax credits of  offset by current state and local taxes of  and current federal amt of  income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the net deferred tax liability was approximately  at december  and and is reflected as a non current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the significant portion of the deferred tax items relates to the tax benefit of impairment charges before allowances and nol carryforwards as they relate to deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liability resulting from the intangible assets recorded at the time of the merger 
private reis had nol carryforwards aggregating approximately  at december   expiring in the years to and is not subject to an annual limitation 
these losses may be utilized against consolidated taxable income  all of which amounts are available for use for financial statement reporting purposes at december  during the seven month period subsequent to the merger  the company generated an nol of approximately  which may be utilized against consolidated taxable income through and is not subject to an annual limitation 
the company separately has nols which resulted from the company s merger with value property trust vlp in and its operating losses in  and prior to the merger 
there is an annual limitation on the use of such nols after an ownership change  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code the code 
as a result of the merger  the company has experienced such an ownership change which has resulted in a new annual limitation of  as a result of the new annual limitation and expirations  the company expects that it could only potentially utilize approximately  of these remaining nols at december  of such amount  approximately  will expire in a fu rther requirement of the tax rules is that after a corporation experiences an ownership change  it must satisfy the continuity of business enterprise  or cobe  requirement which generally requires that a corporation continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business assets in its business for the two year period beginning on the date of the ownership change to be able to utilize nols generated prior to such ownership change 
although the company believes there is a basis for concluding that the cobe requirements were met at december  and through may   management concluded that the company could not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognizing a deferred tax asset relating to such losses for gaap accounting purposes 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has determined that a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  was necessary 
the allowances at december  and relate primarily to amt credits and to the excess of a portion of the tax basis of certain real estate development assets over their respective financial statement basis 
the decrease in the allowance in is attributable to the change in the estima te of the realization of the real estate asset basis differences 
the allowance was reduced significantly at december   as a result of the above described determination that the more likely than not criteria could not be met with respect to all of the wellsford nols existing at the time of the merger 
in addition  approximately  of the wellsford nols expired during together  these resulted in a  reduction in the nol asset and the previously established allowance related thereto during the company s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the reductions in and result from a resolution of unrecognized tax benefits one in and two in  offset by interest accruals on other unrecognized items 
interest and penalties related to these tax provisions were primarily included in general and administrative expenses and approximated  at december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s short term liquidity requirements include current operating and capitalizable costs  near term product development and enhancements of the web site and databases  the current portion of long term debt including scheduled principal payments of approximately  on the bank loan  payable by december  and other expected additional principal payments of  to be made in as discussed under reis services bank loan below  operating and capital leases  warranty costs related to construction  development costs  other capital expenditures  potential settlement of certain outstanding stock options in cash the liability for which was approximately  at decembe r  based upon the closing stock price of the company at december  of per share  and repurchases of additional shares of reis common stock at december   approximately  remained available to be purchased under our current authorization  of which approximately  has been utilized to repurchase shares through march  
the company expects to meet these short term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash  cash generated from the operations of reis services  sales of the company s remaining real estate assets including sales of the remaining single family home and lots either individually or in bulk transactions approximately  was received from the february  sale of the company s claverack project  releases from property related escrow reserves and accounts and interest revenue 
the company s long term liquidity requirements include future operating and capitalizable costs  long term product development and enhancements of the web site and databases  the non current portion of long term debt  operating and capital leases and other capital expenditures 
the company expects to meet these long term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash  cash generated from the operations of reis services  sales of the company s remaining real estate assets including sales of the remaining single family home and lots either individually or in bulk transactions to the extent that any remain unsold after  releases f rom escrow reserves and accounts  repayment of the claverack mortgage receivable and interest revenue
