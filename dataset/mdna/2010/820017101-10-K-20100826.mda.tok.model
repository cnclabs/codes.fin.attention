the company believes this information is useful to investors and other interested parties as customer billings represents all invoiced amounts associated with products shipped during the period reported 
such information should not be considered as a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures is included above 
the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased billings in the government million  retail million  and professional thousand markets 
these increases were partially offset by decreased billings in the health care thousand  and pharmaceutical thousand markets 
the increase in the government market is a result of a million increase in billings related to the sale of the company s sharps mwms to a major us government agency under the contract announced in february the increase in the government market also included thousand related to the support of a major us city immunization program  thousand related to the sales of the takeaway environmental return system as part of the state of iowa and state of north dakota funded programs and thousand related to the company s us department of veterans affairs pilot program 
the increase in the billings in the retail market is a result of  i increased market and customer penetration  ii a strong flu shot season ie  purchases of the sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail systems by retail clinics and pharmacies who use the products to collect  store and properly treat syringes used to administer flu related shots including hn  iii increased purchases of the sharps recovery system solutions used to support community programs  and iv fourth quarter retail billings in preparation of the flu shot season 
the increase in professional market billings is due to the impact of the company s recently launched outbound sales initiative as well as physician  dental  and veterinary offices becoming aware through the efforts of the company and its strong distributor network of cost effective a lternatives to the traditional medical waste pick up 
the decrease in the health care market billings is related to the ordering patterns of the larger home health care customers as well as additional distributor incentives designed to drive future growth in this market 
the decrease in the pharmaceutical market billings is due to the variability in timing associated with the patient support programs the company provides to the drug manufacturers and the discontinuance of a major patient support program 
cost of revenues for the year ended june  of million was of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended june  of million was of revenues 
the higher gross margin for the fiscal year ended june  of versus for the prior fiscal year was a result of i the higher revenue ie higher coverage of fixed cost components in cost of goods sold and ii the mix of products and services sold in fiscal year this was partially offset with a lower gross margin percentage in the third and fourth quarters  which is a result of i products and services sold  ii higher operations and treatment facility personnel cost  and iii increase in the fixed components of cost of sales  namely the operational and treatment facility and infrastructure r elated cost 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the twelve months ended june  of million  increased by million  or  over the sg a expenses for the twelve months ended june  the increase in sg a expense is primarily due to higher i compensation and benefit expense of thousand primarily due to increased number of employees increase in year over year headcount of of which are focused on sales and marketing related activities  ii payroll tax expense of thousand primarily related to common stock issued in conjunction with the public offering  iii non cash  stock based compensation expense of thousand primarily due to the accrued quarterly expense associated with the award of  shares of restricted stock of company co mmon stock to non employee directors as the equity portion of the fiscal year board of director compensation vesting over fiscal year and the award of  additional stock options  in november  july  and june  to employees  including officers  iv professional fees of thousand primarily due to contract sales personnel  patent preparation and filing expenses  legal fees related to the ronald pierce arbitration see note of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  regulatory consulting  audit and related fees  and nasdaq listing fees  v costs related to increased sales and marketing related activities of thousand primarily due to increased sales  advertising  and public relations costs including the launch of the company s new waste conversion process  and vi computer and systems related expenses of thousand primarily due to an increase in locations and software support 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year was negatively imp acted a special charge of thousand which represents expenses incurred with the departure of a former officer of the company 
the company generated operating income of million for the year ended june  compared to an operating income of million for the year ended june  the operating margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the increase in operating income and operating margin is a result of the above mentioned increase in revenue and operating leverage inherent in the company s business model 
the company generated income before tax of million of revenue for the year ended june  versus a pre tax income of million of revenue for the year ended june  the increase in pre tax income is a result of higher operating income discussed above 
the company generated net income of million for the year ended june  compared to net income of million for the year ended june  the increase in net income is a result of higher operating income discussed above 
the year ended june  was positively impacted by the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance of million and corresponding credit to tax expense booked in december see note of the condensed consolidated financial statements 
the company reported diluted earnings per share of for the year ended june  versus diluted earnings per share of for the year ended june  the increase in diluted earnings per share is a result of a higher net income discussed above 
the earnings per share for the year ended june  were adversely impacted by the increase in number of shares used in the computation of  which was a result of i the pro rated impact of the  shares of company common stock issued in conjunction with the public offering see note  ii the pro rated impact of stock options to purchase  of common shares july  through june   iii the issuance of  shares of restricted shares and iv impact on diluted shares of the higher stock price 
prospects for the future the company continues to take advantage of the many opportunities in the markets served as communities  consumers  government and health care and commercial organizations become more aware of the need for the proper treatment of medical sharps waste and unused dispensed medications 
this education process was enhanced in december when the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa issued its new guidelines for the proper disposal of medical sharps  revising the previous guidance that advised patients to dispose of used syringes in the trash see http www 
epa 
gov wastes nonhaz industrial medical med govt 
pdf 
add itionally  in july both the states of california and massachusetts passed legislation designed to mandate appropriate dispos al of sharps waste necessary to protect the general public and workers from potential exposure to contagious diseases and health and safety risks 
currently  nine states ban the disposal of used syringes in the trash and four states are considering similar legislation  while the remaining states operate under the epa guidance noted above 
in august  the us house of representatives and us senate introduced bills and  respectively  if enacted  which would provide for medicare reimbursement  under part d  for the safe and effective disposal of used needles and syringes 
in october  california passed senate bill requiring drug companies that market and sell prescribed medications that are routinely injected at home to submit plans to the california integrated waste management board on or before july  and annually thereafter describing how they support safe needle collection and disposal programs for patients using their drugs 
among the methods recommended as part of the above noted regulatory actions are mail back programs such as those marketed by the company 
the centers for disease control the cdc and the epa estimate that there are over three billion used syringes disposed of annually outside of the hospital setting in the united states 
the company estimates that it would require to million sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system products to properly dispose of all such syringes  which would equate to a market opportunity of billion 
based upon the current level of sales  the company estimates that it has penetrated approximately of this billion market opportunity 
additionally  an estimated of the four billion dispensed medication prescriptions go unused every year in the united states generating an estimated million pounds of unused medication waste 
the company estimated the market opportunity for the proper recovery and management of the unused medication s to be at least billion per year 
the company continues to develop new products and services including the sharps mwms  the takeaway line of products for unused medications including the takeaway environmental return system  the and gallon medical professional recovery system  the sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system and the new takeaway recovery and reporting system which offers the collection  storage  audit  witnessed treatment and documentation of unused medications such as flu vaccine  tamiflu  and relenza 
the company continues to develop products and services designed to facilitate the proper and cost effective solutions for management of medical waste and unused dispensed medication generated outside of the hospital and large health care facility setting 
the com pany believes its future growth will be driven by  among other items  i the positive impact and awareness created by the existing and above noted regulatory actions as well as additional potential future legislation  ii the effects of the company s extensive direct marketing and public relations efforts and iii the company s leadership position in the development and sales of products and services designed for the proper and cost effective solutions for management of medical waste and unused dispensed medications generated outside the hospital and large health care facility setting 
demand for the company s primary product  the sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system  which facilitates the proper and cost effective management of medical waste including hypodermic needles  lancets and other devices or objects used to puncture or lacerate the skin referred to as sharps  has been growing rapidly because of its cost effective and convenient mail back component and unique data tracking feature 
in addition  targeted opportunities continue to expand as a result of  i legislation mandating the proper disposal of sharps  ii the growing awareness of the need to properly handle sharps medical waste for safety and environmental concerns  iii the significant increase in self injectable medications and iv the changing paradigm in the health care industry 
the company anticipates another strong flu shot business included in the retail market billings in light of heightened awareness of the need for flu vaccines and increased accessibility of the vaccine at traditional retailers 
traditionally  the flu shot season positively impacts the quarter ended september  however  the company recognized retail market billings of million in the fourth quarter of june  more than double the million in the prior year 
the company is actively marketing its sharps mwms to federal  state and local agencies as well as to large corporations 
on february   the company announced a million contract award the us government contract award to provide its sharps mwms to a major us government agency 
the total contract is expected to be executed over a five year period one year plus four option years 
on february   the company received a purchase order for million million of which was recognized in fiscal year  million was recognized in the first half of fiscal year 
in january  sharps was awarded the first option year ending january  valued at approximately million and is expected to be recognized from february  through january  there is expected to be approximately million in revenue in calendar year for the maintenance component of the contract including million in the second half of calendar year the remaining three option years are expected to be approximately million per contract year 
although  the company believes the amounts above to be reasonable based upon the underlying contract and its current project plan  it makes no assurances regarding the actual recognition of revenue by fiscal year  which could vary significantly from that noted above 
in december  sharps compliance was awarded a five year federal supply schedule contract by the general services administration of the us government gsa 
the gsa schedule provides a streamlined vehicle for federal government agencies to purchase the company s products and services 
sharps was also awarded a distribution and pricing agreement dapa with the defense supply center of philadelphia s directorate of medical material which provides the automated tools to promote efficient procurement of medical related products for the department of defense 
the company believes these two contracts should facilitate the sale of virtually all of the company s products and solutions in addition to the sharps mwms to the many us government agencies whom  to date  have no t purchased significant quantities of products or solutions designed to address the proper treatment of used syringes and other sharps as well as unused medications generated outside of the hospital setting utilizing the usps or ups 
in january  the company announced a pilot program with the united states department of veterans affairs va 
the program was launched within the va capitol health care network veterans integrated service network or visn  which currently provides quality health care for eligible veterans in maryland and portions of virginia  west virginia  and pennsylvania  as well as the district of columbia 
the pilot allows each of the medical centers within the visn region  both inpatient and outpatient  to provide the sharps recovery system formerly known as the sharps disposal by mail system and the takeaway environmental return system solutions to their patients 
since its original launch  the pilot program has now expanded to three other geo graphic regions including visn which covers illinois  wisconsin  and the upper peninsula of michigan  visn which covers arizona  new mexico  and western texas and visn which covers alaska  idaho  oregon  and washington 
the visn network is part of the veterans health administration which encompasses the largest integrated health care system in the united states  consisting of medical centers  in addition to numerous community based outpatient clinics  community living centers and vet centers 
together these health care facilities provide comprehensive care to over million veterans each year 
the sharps mwms  a medical waste management system  is a comprehensive medical waste and dispensed medication solution which includes an array of products and services necessary to effectively collect  store and treat medical waste and unused dispensed medication outside of the hospital or large health care facility setting 
sharps mwms  which is designed for rapid deployment  features the sharps recovery system formerly known as the sharps disposal by mail system and takeaway environmental return system products the products combined with warehousing  inventory management  training  data and other services the services necessary to provide a comprehensive solution 
the sharps mwms is designed to be an integral part of governmental and commercial emergency preparedness programs 
the company recognizes revenue for the product portion of the contract in accordance with the revenue recognition policy for the sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system products 
the services portion of the contract  described above  is recognized as revenue as services are performed 
we believe the pace of regulation of sharps and unused dispensed medications disposal is gaining momentum at both the state and federal level 
currently  states restrict or have introduced legislation to restrict the disposal of used sharps in household trash and states have also enacted or introduced legislation to regulate the disposal of pharmaceuticals to reduce pollution of the environment 
as state and federal enforcement of these statutes increases  more companies will turn to solutions such as ours to help manage their medical waste and regulatory compliance 
we believe the company is well positioned to benefit given our strict adherence to established standards and extensive documentation and records 
the company serves multiple markets including  but not limited to  government  health care  retail  professional  hospitality  pharmaceutical  and other markets 
as shown in the results for the fiscal year ended june   the company experienced a significant increase in its overall business  primarily related to the government million us government contract  retail strong flu shot season and professional launched outbound sales initiative markets 
the million build out phase of the major government contract occurred throughout calendar year there is expected to be approximately million in revenue in calendar year for the maintenance component including the million  which was recognized in the second half of fiscal year in addition  the maintenance component of the contract includes approximately million in years   and these increases were partially offset by decreases in the health care ordering patterns of health care customers and distributor incentives and pharmaceutical timing in association with patient support programs markets 
in the pharmaceutical market  the sales cycle has been longer than initially anticipated 
the company is most encouraged by opportunities in the retail market and government market through offerings to major retail pharmacies and expansion of the va pilot program and the existing mwms program to address unused medications 
the company currently has a cash balance of million and no debt as of june  additionally  the company received a federal income tax refund of million in july on july   the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo  national association 
the credit agreement replaces the credit agreement executed on march  with jp morgan chase  jp as of the date of issuance of the annual report  the company had no outstanding borrowings  thousand in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
the patent pending green waste conversion process  announced by the company in april  eliminates medical waste processed for the company s customers from going into landfills 
the process transforms treated medical waste into a new product called pella drx a clean  raw material used in the manufacture of industrial resource 
treatment of medical waste has presented major concerns for american society as the vast majority of medical waste is ultimately disposed of in landfills  creating massive liabilities for future generations 
the sharps waste conversion process creates a sustainable product and a much needed green method to treat medical waste while creating a useable  safe  and clean raw material 
we believe pella drx is ideally suited for energy i ntensive industries like cement  lime  steel  and power plants 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the increase in cash is due to cash generated by operating activities of million plus the net proceeds from the public offering of million  the exercise of stock options of million and the excess tax benefits of million from stock based award activity  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
accounts receivable increased by thousand to million at june  from million at june  the increase is primarily due to million in retail billings in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year related to the preparation for the flu shot season 
inventory decreased by thousand to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in inventory is primarily attributable to the completion of the initial product phase of the us government contract 
prepaid and other current assets increased by million to million at june  from thousand at june  the increase is primarily due to the prepaid income taxes federal of million which represents the payment in december of federal income taxes offset by tax benefits related to third and fourth quarter losses 
the company received a federal income tax refund of million in july property  plant and equipment  net increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the increase in property and equipment is due to capital expenditures of million which was partially offset by depreciation expense of thousand and disposal of assets of thousand 
the capital expenditures are attributable primarily to the investment of i leasehold improvements of thousand  ii warehouse operations related equipment of thousand  iii facility improvements and related operations equipment of thousand  iv molds  dies and printing plates of thousand v computer equipment and custom software programming totaling thousand  vi furniture for expanded office space of thousand  and vii phone system expansion of thousand 
in addition to the above and in conjunction with the newly introduced patent pending green waste conversion process that transforms treated medical waste into a new product called pella drx  the company spent approximately thousand related to equipment to support the production of this product 
the warehouse operations equipment included racking and related equipment necessary to accommodate the expansion of the company s texas and atlanta operations and distribution facilities 
the leasehold expenditures were incurred to support the company s expansion in both its texas and georgia facilities 
the molds  dies and printing plates were procured for development of new products and duplicate molds needed to facilitate additional production capacity in light of the company s growth 
the facility expenditures included a generator and general facility upgrades to the autoclave system 
accounts payable decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease is a result of the timing of payments for raw materials purchased reflecting the completion of the product portion of the us government contract and capital expenditures related to the expansion effort discussed in the paragraph above 
accrued liabilities decreased by thousand to million at june  from million at june  stockholders equity increased by million to million at june  from million at june  this increase is attributable to  i net income for the year ended june  of million  ii the million effect of the  shares sold in the december public offering at per share net of underwriting commission  iii the effect of stock options to purchase  common stock exercised with proceeds of million average exercise price of  iv the effect on equity credit of non cash stock based award expense of thousand  and v the excess tax benefits from stock based award activity of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed a public offering of  shares  of which  were sold to cover the over allotment option  at a price of per share net of underwriting commission 
the net proceeds of million from the shares sold by the company net of direct offering expenses is expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including expansion of our product offerings  facilities and infrastructure to meet the continued expected growth of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
the company s most significant off balance sheet transactions include commitments associated with non cancelable operating leases see note commitments and contingencies 
the company has other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit see note notes payable and long term debt 
the company entered into non cancelable operating leases for certain of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
credit facility on july   the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association 
the credit agreement replaces the credit agreement executed on march  with jpmorgan chase bank  na the prior credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a two year  million line of credit facility  the proceeds of which may be utilized for i working capital  ii capital expenditures  iii letters of credit up to  iv acquisitions up to  and v general corporate purposes 
unlike the prior credit agreement  there is no borrowing base computation that limits the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires on july  indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings bear interest at either i a fluctuating rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin of basis points or ii at the company s option  a fixed rate for a   or day period set at the option date s libor plus a margin of basis points 
any outstanding revolving loans  and accrued and unpaid interest  will be due and payable on july   the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the company paid a one time non refundable commitment fee of  applicable to the entire two year term of the credit agreement 
the company will pay a fee of per annum on the unused amount of the line of credit 
we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the credit agreement would be approximately as of june  the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth of million and not exceed a ratio of liabilities to tangible net worth of to the company is in compliance with all covenants as of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default that remains uncured after any applicable cure period  the lenders commitment to make further loans may terminate and the company may be required to make immediate repayment of all indebtedness to the lenders 
management believes that the company s current cash resources cash on hand and cash generated from operations along with its million line of credit with wells fargo bank will be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months ending june  treatment facility the company s treatment facility in carthage  texas includes an incinerator which is currently permitted at a capacity of eleven tons per day 
in february  the company installed an autoclave system and technology capable of treating up to seven tons per day of medical waste at the same facility 
autoclaving is a process that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
the autoclave is a technology that is a cost effective alternative to traditional incineration 
it also supplements the treatment capacity of the company and is an integral part of the treatment operations as the company utilizes both incineration and autoclave technology in its day to day operations 
the autoclave system is not impacted by the epa amended clean air act discussed below 
with the addition of the autoclave  the company believes it owns one of only approximately ten permitted commercial treatment facilities in the country capable of treating all types of medical waste 
in november and september  the epa and the texas commission on environmental quality promulgated new regulations under the clean air act and associated state statutes which will affect the operations of the incineration facility located in carthage  texas 
these regulations modify the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility 
the new rules will necessitate changes to the company s owned incinerator and pollution control equipment at the facility or require installation of an alternative treatment method to ensure compliance 
these regulations will also require the company to obtain a title v permit and conduct additional monitoring 
the company is required to comply with these new standards by the end of such changes will require the co mpany to incur significant capital expenditures in order to meet the requirements of the regulations 
the company has studied these amended regulations and their options  and decided in the interim to move forward with the process of adding alternative technology  autoclaving  which meets the epa clean air act requirements  for medical waste disposal which became fully operational in february at its current facility in carthage  texas 
autoclaving is a process that treats regulated waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
combining the autoclaving with a shredding or grinder process allows the waste to be disposed in a landfill operation 
the company believes autoclaving is environmentally cleaner and a less costly method of treating medical waste than incineration 
due to its continued growth  the company anticipates that it will incur additional capital expenditures needed in order to meet the new air emission regulations 
the add itional capital expenditures are not expected to exceed million 
the company expects capital expenditures related to these new regulations to be made by the end of the first half of fiscal year inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal year and beyond 
quarterly results of operations unaudited the following tables set forth selected quarterly information for fiscal years and we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts below to present fairly the results of such periods in thousands except per share amounts

under this guidance  certain products offered by the company have revenue producing components that are recognized over multiple delivery points sharps recovery system formerly the sharps disposal by mail systems and various takeaway environmental return system referred to as mailbacks and sharps pump and asset return system  referred to as pump returns and can consist of up to three separate elements  or units of measure  as follows the sale of the co mpliance and container system  return transportation and treatment service 
the individual fair value of the transportation and treatment services are determined by the sales price of the service offered by third parties  with the fair value of the compliance and container being the residual value 
revenue for the sale of the compliance and container is recognized upon delivery to the customer  at which time the customer takes title and assumes risk of ownership 
transportation revenue is recognized when the customer returns the compliance and container system and the container has been received at the company s facility 
the compliance and container system is mailed to the company s facility using the usps and ups 
treatment revenue is recognized upon the destruction or conversion and proof of receipt and treatment having been prepared on the container 
since the transportation element and the treatment elements are undelivered servi ces at the point of initial sale of the compliance and container  transportation and treatment revenue is deferred until the services are performed 
the current and long term portions of deferred revenues are determined through regression analysis and historical trends 
furthermore  through regression analysis of historical data  the company has determined that a certain percentage of all compliance and container systems sold may not be returned 
accordingly  a portion of the transportation and treatment elements are recognized at the point of sale 
on july   the company adopted asu no 
which further clarifies guidance on revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance requires an evaluation of all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting  both at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the updated guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting 
however  it does not change the timing of revenue recognition or manner of revenue recognition for a given unit of accounting 
the company has reviewed each of the potential revenue producing components the compliance and container system  the transportation revenue and the treatment revenue and determined that there will be no change in the units of accounting 
asu no 
establishes a new selling price hierarchy for allocating value to the units of accounting 
under this relative selling price methodology  an estimated selling price is determined for all deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting 
the actual consideration received in a multiple deliverable arrangement is then allocated to the units based on their relative sales price 
because an estimated selling price must be set for each unit  the residual method used previously by the company to allocate consideration to the compliance and container system is no longer allowed 
the selling price for the transportation revenue and the treatment revenue  which utilized third party evidence  did not change from the prior method 
the company estimated the sellin g price of the compliance and container system based on the product and services provided including compliance with local  state and federal laws  adherence to stringent manufacturing and testing requirements  safety to the patient and the community as well as storage and containment capabilities 
the company has calculated the change in revenue assigned to each of the units of accounting under the relative selling price methodology as compared to using the residual allocation method and determined that the change is not material 
the company has determined that the implementation of asu no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements when compared to its previous revenue recognition methodology 
additional disclosures required by asu no 
will be included in the company s interim and annual reports for the year ending june  stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under guidance which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
total stock based compensation expense for the fiscal years ended june  and june   was thousand thousand included in cost of revenues and thousand included in general and administrative expenses in the company s cons olidated statement of operations and thousand included in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations  respectively 
the guidance requires any reduction in taxes payable resulting from tax deductions that exceed the recognized tax benefit associated with compensation expense excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows and as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the company included million and thousand of excess tax benefits in our cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb emerging issue task force issued asu no 
which further clarifies revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements
