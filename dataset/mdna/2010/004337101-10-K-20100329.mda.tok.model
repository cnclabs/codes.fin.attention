item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an overview of the significant factors affecting the financial condition and the results of operations of the corporation and its subsidiaries for the years ended december  and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this discussion and analysis 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein  including documents incorporated by reference  that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
examples of forward looking statements include discussions as to our expectations  beliefs  plans  goals  objectives and future financial or other performance or assumptions concerning matters discussed in this document 
forward looking statements often use words such as believes  expects  plans  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends or other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation include  but are not limited to  changes in continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions and in the financial markets and the impact of any policies or programs implemented pursuant to the eesa  branch expansion plans  interest rates  general economic conditions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the comptroller  us treasury and the frb  the economy of northern virginia  including governmental spending and real estate markets  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  and accounting principles  policies and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements contained herein  and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 
for additional discussion of risk factors that may cause our actual future results to differ materially from the results indicated within forward looking statements  please see item a risk factors herein 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the corporation s financial statements management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgments that it makes include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principals of accounting i accounting standards codification asc no 
contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and ii asc  receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based upon industry standards  known risk characteristics  and management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation considers among other factors  the estimated market value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
for further information about our practices with respect to allowance for loan losses  please see the subsection allowance for loan losses below 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities the bank s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the estimated fair value of the portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors 
changes in estimated fair value are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
at december  there were no securities in the securities portfolio with other than temporary impairment 
income taxes the corporation uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the deferred provision for income taxes is the result of the net change in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year 
this amount combined with the current taxes payable or refundable results in the income tax expense for the current year 
our evaluation of the deductibility or taxability of items included in the corporation s tax returns has not resulted in the identification of any material  uncertain tax positions 
fair value fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates 
the fair value estimates of existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments do not include the value of anticipated future business or the values of assets and liabilities not considered financial instruments 
for additional information about our financial assets carried at fair value  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition summary the corporation completed its tenth year of operation and recorded net income of million 
total assets at december  were million compared to million in the decrease in total assets is primarily due to a million reduction in investment securities and an million decrease in loans held for sale 
interest bearing deposits in other banks increased million and other assets increased million 
the following discussions by major categories explain the changes in financial condition 
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks represents cash and non interest bearing balances at other banks and cash letters in process of collection at the frb 
at december  cash and due from banks totaled approximately million compared to million at december  the balance fluctuates depending on the volume of cash letters in process of collection at the frb 
interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold at december  interest bearing balances in other banks totaled million compared to million at december  these balances are maintained at the frb and the fhlb of atlanta and provide liquidity for managing daily cash inflows and outflows from deposits and loans 
investment securities the corporation s securities portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  municipal securities  cra mutual fund  mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies and frb and fhlb stock 
the investment portfolio is used to provide liquidity and as a tool for managing interest sensitivity in the balance sheet  while generating income 
at december  the estimated fair value of the securities portfolio totaled million  down from million in the decrease is due to maturing and called securities that were not reinvested 
all securities were classified as available for sale 
the financial accounting standards board fasb requires that securities classified as available for sale be accounted for at fair market value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders equity 
the following tables present the types  amounts and maturity distribution of the securities portfolio

commercial loans increased million in and commercial real estate loans increased million while residential real estate loans decreased million 
the bank concentrates on providing banking services to small to medium sized businesses and professionals in our market area 
commercial real estate loans comprised of the loans held for investment portfolio  however we do not have any exposure to builders or developers 
our loan officers maintain a professional relationship with our clients and are responsive to their financial needs 
they are directly involved in the community and it is this involvement and commitment that leads to referrals and continued growth 
loans held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
the level of loans held for sale fluctuates with the volume of loans originated during the month and the timing of loans purchased by investors 
loan origination volume including brokered loans totaled billion in compared to million in  an increase 
the increase was due to the low interest rate environment and refinance activity

management believes the amount of the reserve and the methodology applied to arrive at the amount of the reserve is justified and appropriate 
outside of our own analysis  our reserve adequacy and methodology are reviewed on a regular basis by an internal audit program  and bank regulators and such reviews have not resulted in any material adjustment to the reserve 
the schedule below  allocation of the allowance for loan losses  reflects the pro rata allocation by the different loan types 
the methodology as to how the allowance is derived is discussed below 
the bank has developed a comprehensive risk weighting system based on individual loan characteristics that enables the bank to allocate the composition of the allowance for loan losses by types of loans 
adequacy of the allowance is assessed monthly and increased by provisions charged to expense 
charge offs are taken  no less frequently than at the close of each fiscal quarter 
the methodology by which we systematically determine the amount of our allowance is set forth by the board of directors in our credit policy  pursuant to which our chief credit officer is charged with ensuring that each loan is individually evaluated and the portfolio characteristics are evaluated to arrive at an appropriate aggregate reserve 
the results of the analysis are documented  reviewed and approved by the board of directors no less than quarterly 
the following elements are considered in this analysis loss estimates on specific problem credits  individual loan risk ratings  lending staff changes  loan review and board oversight  loan policies and procedures  portfolio trends with respect to volume  delinquency  composition concentrations of credit  risk rating migration  levels of classified credit  off balance sheet credit exposure  any other factors considered relevant from time to time 
all loans are graded or risk rated individually for loss potential at the time of origination and as warranted thereafter  but no less frequently than quarterly 
loss potential factors are applied based upon a blend of the following criteria our own direct experience at this bank  our collective management experience in administering similar loan portfolios in the market for nearly years  and peer data contained in statistical releases issued by both the comptroller and the fdic 
although looking only at peer data and the bank s historically low write offs would suggest a lower loan loss allowance  our management s experience with similar portfolios in the same market combined with the fact that our portfolio is relatively unseasoned  justify a conservative approach in contemplating external statistical resources 
accordingly  management s collective experience at this bank and other banks is the most heavily weighted criterion  and the weighting is subjective and varies by loan type  amount  collateral  structure  and repayment terms 
prevailing economic conditions generally and within each individual borrower s business sector are considered  as well as any changes in the borrower s own financial position and  in the case of commercial loans  management structure and business operations 
when deterioration develops in an individual credit  the loan is placed on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely 
all loans on the watch list are evaluated for specific loss potential based upon either an evaluation of the liquidated value of the collateral or cash flow deficiencies 
if management believes that  with respect to a specific loan  an impaired source of repayment  collateral impairment or a change in a debtor s financial condition presents a heightened risk of loss  the loan is classified as impaired and the book balance of the loan is reduced to collateral value or present value of cash flows and a specific reserve is established to further guard against loss upon liquidation

the loans are carried at the current net realizable value after consideration of thousand in specific reserves 
the accrual of interest is discontinued at the time a loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction to the principal balance 
interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
the loss potential for each loan has been evaluated and in management s opinion the risk of loss is adequately reserved against 
management actively works with the borrowers to maximize the potential for repayment and reports on the status to the board of directors monthly 
at december   oreo was composed of one single family property located in suburban maryland carried at a value of thousand  one industrial property located in winchester  virginia carried at a value of thousand  one office building located in prince william county  virginia carried at a value of million  and two contiguous office buildings located in baltimore  maryland carried at a value of million 
all of the properties are being actively marketed in an effort to liquidate these assets 
deposits deposits totaled million at december  and were comprised of non interest bearing demand deposits in the amount of million  savings and interest bearing deposits in the amount of million and time deposits in the amount of million 
total deposits decreased approximately million from december  non interest bearing deposits decreased million from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is due to balance fluctuations in existing commercial accounts 
savings and interest bearing deposit accounts increased million from million at december  to million at december  interest bearing demand deposits increased million and money market and savings increased million as a result of new accounts 
time deposits decreased million and totaled million at december  compared to million in the decrease in time deposits occurred as a result of lower rates being offered to rate sensitive customers 
we use wholesale funding or brokered deposits to supplement deposits and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position 
together with fhlb borrowings we use brokered deposits to fund the short term cash needs associated with the lhfs activities discussed under loans as well as other funding needs 
brokered deposits included totaled million and million at december  and respectively 
we participate in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
through cdars our depositors are able to obtain fdic insurance of up to million 
the fdic currently includes cdars deposits with brokered deposits even though the deposits originate from our customers 
these deposits are placed at other participating financial institutions to obtain fdic insurance and we receive a reciprocal amount in return from these financial institutions 
brokered deposits include million and million at december  and respectively  in reciprocal cdars deposits

banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the corporation and the bank are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off the balance sheet 
both the corporation and bank are classified as well capitalized  which is the highest rating

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was million  compared to million in and million in this amount was determined by management to restore the allowance for loan losses to a level believed to be adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation as of december  non interest income non interest income consists of revenue generated from service fees on deposit accounts  gains on sale of loans and other charges and fees 
the mortgage corporation provides the most significant contributions towards non interest income and is subject to wide fluctuations due to the general interest rate environment and economic conditions 
total non interest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage corporation totaled million in compared to million in gains on sale of loans increased in as a result of a million increase in mortgage loan originations 
other income totaled million in compared to million in included in other income are mortgage loan settlement fees amounting to million in  up from million in total non interest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage corporation totaled million in compared to million in gains on sale of loans increased in despite a decrease in loan originations 
the increase is largely due to an increase in the profit margin on loans sold by the mortgage corporation 
mortgage broker fees amounted to million in down from million in due to a decrease in loans originated in this manner 
other income  comprised primarily of miscellaneous loan fees  totaled million in compared to million in non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in compared to million in compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation and benefits at the mortgage corporation and relates to the increased volume of loan originations in other operating expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to the following expense categories advertising expense million primarily at the mortgage corporation  million in investor fees paid in conjunction with selling mortgage loans  million in management fees associated with the operation of certain offices of the mortgage corporation  million in the provision for losses on mortgage loans sold  million in fdic premiums 
oreo expenses increased million in as a result of valuation adjustments and expenses associated with foreclosed properties 
non interest expense totaled million in compared to million in compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to increased staff and merit salary increases 
other operating expense totaled million for the period ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in broker premiums as a result of eliminating wholesale operations at the mortgage corporation in management fees increased approximately thousand in and represent fees paid for managing certain offices of the mortgage corporation 
the provision for losses on loans sold by the mortgage corporation increased thousand and represents amounts credited to the allowance for possible losses associated with loans sold

the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the corporation s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of both depositors and borrowers 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the corporation s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the corporation can earn an appropriate return for its shareholders 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and maturities of investment securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
at december   overnight interest bearing balances totaled million and securities available for sale net of restricted stock totaled million 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
at december   the bank had a line of credit with the fhlb totaling million and million in term loans outstanding at fixed rates ranging from to leaving approximately million available on the line 
in addition to the line of credit at the fhlb  the bank and mortgage corporation issue repurchase agreements and commercial paper 
as of december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million and commercial paper issued amounted to million 
the interest rate on these instruments is variable and subject to change daily 
the bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks and  at december   these lines amounted to million 
the corporation also has million in subordinated debentures to support the growth of the organization 
the bank relies on deposits and other short and long term resources for liquidity from a variety of sources that substantially reduces reliance upon any single provider 
the corporation expects its short and long term sources of liquidity and capital to remain adequate to support expected growth 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to make future payments as of december  payments due by period december  less than more than year years years total in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb long term borrowings senior unsecured term note commercial paper us treasury demand notes subordinated debentures leases total off balance sheet items during the ordinary course of business  the bank issues commitments to extend credit and  at december   these commitments amounted to million 
these commitments do not necessarily represent cash requirements  since many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn on 
at december  the bank had approximately million in unfunded lines and letters of credit 
the mortgage corporation had open forward contracts at december  totaling million and million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage corporation has agreements with a variety of counter parties to whom mortgage loans are sold on a non recourse basis 
as customary in the industry  the agreements require the mortgage corporation to extend representations and warranties with respect to program compliance  borrower misrepresentation  fraud and early payment performance 
under the agreements  the counter parties are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of the mortgage corporation for loans that contain covered deficiencies 
the overall economic conditions  rising unemployment and weak values in the housing market has created a heighted risk of loss due to the representations and warranties associated with sold mortgage loans 
upon recognizing this heightened risk as well as actual claims  the mortgage corporation adopted a reserve methodology whereby provisions are made to an expense account to fund a reserve maintained as a liability account on the balance sheet for potential losses 
the amount of the provision and adequacy of the reserve is recommended by management and approved by the board of the mortgage corporation no less than quarterly 
management estimates the reserve based upon the maintenance of a schedule of expected losses on loans with claims or indemnifications and ensures the reserve equals or exceeds the estimate of loss 
claims in process are recognized in the period received  actively monitored and subject to validation prior to payment 
often times  claims are not factually validated and the claim is rescinded 
once claims are validated and the actual or potential loss is agreed upon with the counterparty  the reserve is charged and a cash payment is made to settle the claim 
the loan performance data of sold loans is not made available to the mortgage corporation by the counter parties  thereby making it impossible to estimate the timing and amount of claims until such time as claims are actually presented 
through careful monitoring and conservative estimates  the balance of the reserve has adequately provided for all claims since established 
at december  and the balance in this reserve totaled approximately million and million respectively 
the following table presents the activity in the allowance for losses on mortgage loans sold at december  and allowance for losses on mortgage loans sold december  balance at beginning of year provision charged to operating expense recoveries charge offs balance at end of year recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the funds management committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the corporation s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity management the corporation uses a simulation model to analyze  manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and re pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet 
according to the model run for the period ended december  over a twelve month period  an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
a basis points decrease in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income and is considered unlikely given current interest rate levels 
while management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact  there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the corporation s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the corporation manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its funds management committee 
the funds management committee meets monthly and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the mortgage corporation is party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the corporation and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks his or her interest rate  the corporation effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the corporation must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
the corporation is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the corporation utilizes either a best efforts sell forward or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
failure to effectively monitor  manage and hedge the interest rate risk associated with the mandatory commitments subjects the corporation to potentially significant market risk 
throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory sell forward commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the consolidated statement of income under other non interest income 
the corporation s management has made complex judgments in the recognition of gains and losses in connection with this activity 
the corporation utilizes a third party and its proprietary simulation model to assist in identifying and managing the risk associated with this activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non financial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
