item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses from continuing operations were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  of which   and  respectively  were sponsored by us 
there were no research and development expenses from discontinued operations in and research and development expenses from discontinued operations were million in competition some of the drugs we are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing ir related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 
many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
for a discussion of the risks associated with competition  see below under item a 
risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect to us 

table of contents for marketing outside the united states before fda approval to market  we must submit an export permit application to the fda 
we also are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and there can be no assurance that we or any of our partners will meet and sustain any such requirements 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
royalties we currently receive from king on avinza represent a significant portion of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza expires in november  however  applications for generic forms of avinza have been submitted to the fda 
the united states patents relating to promacta do not expire until december subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments 
for a discussion of the risks associated with patent and proprietary rights  see below under item a 
risk factors 
human resources as of february   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
risks related to us and our business 
royalties based on sales of avinza and promacta represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
king pharmaceuticals  or king  is obligated to pay us royalties based on its sales of avinza and glaxosmithkline  or gsk  is obligated to pay us royalties on its sales of promacta 
these royalties represented and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and will continue to be a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues for some time 
we also receive milestones and collaborative revenue from our partners in various collaborations  but the amount of such revenue is unknown and highly uncertain 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to avinza or promacta could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock  as could any reduction in our expected milestone and collaborative revenue 
setbacks for avinza and promacta could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 
king and gsk s sales efforts for avinza and promacta  respectively  could be affected by a number of factors and decisions regarding their organizations  operations  and activities as well as events both related and unrelated to avinza or promacta  including sales force reorganizations and lower than expected sales calls and prescription volumes 
avinza and promacta could also face stiffer competition from existing or future products 
the negative impact on the sales of avinza or promacta will negatively affect our royalties  revenues and earnings 
sales of avinza and promacta may also be negatively impacted by higher than expected discounts especially pharmacy benefit management group purchasing organization rebates and medicaid rebates  which can be substantial  returns and chargebacks and or slower than expected market penetration 
other setbacks that avinza could face in the sustained release opioid market include abuse issues and the inability to obtain sufficient quotas of morphine from the drug enforcement agency to support production requirements 
avinza or promacta could also face regulatory action and product safety issues 
for example  the fda previously requested expanded warnings on the avinza label to alert doctors and patients to the dangers of using avinza with alcohol 
changes were subsequently made to the label 
the fda also requested clinical studies to investigate the risks associated with taking avinza with alcohol 
any additional warnings  studies and any further regulatory action could have significant adverse effects on avinza sales 
on september   king reported that actavis  a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products headquartered in iceland  had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with a paragraph iv certification pertaining to avinza  the rights to which were acquired by king from us in february according to the report  actavis s paragraph iv certification sets forth allegations that us patent no 
 or the patent  which pertains to avinza  and which is listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  will not be infringed by actavis s manufacture  use  or sale of the product for which the anda was submitted 
the expiration date for this patent is november king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey on october  against actavis  inc and actavis elizabeth llc for patent infringement under the patent 
the lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent actavis from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 

table of contents on july   king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey against sandoz inc  or sandoz  for patent infringement under the patent 
according to the complaint  sandoz filed an anda for morphine sulfate extended release capsules and  in connection with the anda filing  sandoz provided written certification to the fda alleging that the claims of the patent are invalid  unenforceable and or will not be infringed by the manufacture  use or sale of sandoz s proposed morphine product 
similar to the lawsuit against actavis  this lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent sandoz from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 
avinza was licensed from elan corporation  or elan  which is its sole manufacturer 
any problems with elan s manufacturing operations or capacity could reduce sales of avinza  as could any licensing or other contract disputes with elan  raw materials suppliers  or others 
further  pursuant to the agreement with king  we may no longer receive avinza royalties on a quarterly basis  but will collect royalties on an annual basis  which may adversely impact our cash flows 
our product candidates face significant development and regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales and or milestone revenue 
before we obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action  including bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene 
failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rate at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but are not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times 
for example  the trial entitled eltrombopag to reduce the need for platelet transfusion in subjects with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia undergoing elective invasive procedures elevate was suspended in october in accordance with an idmc recommendation 
gsk terminated the elevate study and the program is under review 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 
we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of 
table of contents a variety of diseases 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
if we consume cash more quickly than expected  and if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be forced to curtail operations 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
also  we may acquire companies  businesses or products and the consummation of such acquisitions may consume additional cash 
for example  as part of the consideration for our recent acquisition of pharmacopeia  we distributed approximately million in cash to pharmacopeia stockholders 
security holders of pharmacopeia also received contingent value rights under which we could be required to make an aggregate cash payment of million to such security holders under certain circumstances 
security holders of neurogen and metabasis also received contingent value rights under which we could be required to make unspecified payments under certain circumstances 
in december  the internal revenue service  or irs  issued to us a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  seeking an increase to our taxable income for the fiscal year of million and a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we responded to the nopa in february  disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the irs in the nopa 
we recorded a fin liability of million related to the income tax effect of the nopa and million related to estimated interest due on the proposed underpayment of tax 
we also recorded deferred income tax assets of million associated with the ability to carry back losses from and to offset the nopa 
in addition  we recorded an income tax receivable of million associated with changes in income tax law in relation to prior amt taxes paid on carry back periods 
we have not recorded the penalties proposed by the irs in our financial statements as we believe that we met the appropriate standard for the tax position on our tax return 
if we are unsuccessful in our negotiations with the irs  we may be required to pay the million penalty and utilize a significant amount of our net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that our capital resources  including our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty revenues  will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least for the next twelve months 
however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time 
examples of relevant potential changes that could impact our capital resources include the costs associated with our drug research and development activities  and additional costs we may incur if our development programs are delayed or are more expensive to implement than we currently anticipate  
table of contents changes in existing collaborative relationships  including the funding we receive in connection with those relationships  the progress of our milestone and royalty producing activities  our ability to reach a favorable resolution with the irs with respect to their audit of our fiscal federal tax return  or to other potential tax assessments  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  the termination of our lease agreements  the purchase of additional capital equipment  cash payments or refunds we may be required to make pursuant to certain agreements with third parties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the outcome of related litigation 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with partners or other third parties that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
if  as the result of a merger  or otherwise  our collaborative partners were to change their strategy or the focus of their development and commercialization efforts with respect to our alliance products  the success of our alliance products could be adversely affected 
our collaborative partners may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts as the result of a merger 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have historically re evaluated their priorities from time to time  including following mergers and consolidations which are common in these industries  and two of our collaborative partners have recently entered into merger agreements 
in october  wyeth  a collaborative partner of ours  and pfizer announced that pfizer had completed its acquisition of wyeth in a cash and stock transaction 
furthermore  in november  schering plough corporation  another of our collaborative partners  and merck co  inc  or merck  announced that merck and schering plough had combined  under the name merck  in a stock and cash transaction 
as a result of the consummation of these mergers  our collaborative partners may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with our alliance products 
furthermore  the ability of our alliance products to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborative partners reduce or fail to increase spending related to such products as a result of these mergers 
if our collaborative partners terminate their collaborations with us or do not commit sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or distribution of our alliance products  we could be required to devote additional resources to our alliance products  seek new collaborative partners or abandon such alliance products  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may not be successful in entering into additional out license agreements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our liquidity or require us to alter development plans on our products 
we have entered into several out licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of our products 
although we expend considerable resources on internal research and development for our proprietary programs  we may not be successful in entering into additional out licensing agreements under favorable terms due to several factors including the difficulty in creating valuable product candidates that target large market opportunities  research and spending priorities of potential licensing partners  
table of contents willingness of and the resources available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to in license product candidates for their clinical pipelines  or differences of opinion with potential partners on the valuation of products we are seeking to out license 
the inability to enter into out licensing agreements under favorable terms and to earn milestone payments  license fees and or upfront fees may adversely affect our liquidity and may force us to curtail or delay development of some or all of our proprietary programs  which in turn may harm our business and the value of our stock 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact avinza  promacta  bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  lgd  and any other products or potential products 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
on march   rockefeller filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  against us alleging  among other things  a breach by us of our september  license agreement with rockefeller  as well as other causes of action for unjust enrichment  quantum meruit  specific performance to perform an audit and declaratory relief 
in february we reached a settlement with rockefeller whereby the parties resolved all disputes that have arisen between them  including rockefeller s primary claim relating to the development of promacta as well our counterclaims 
other possible disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  other possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 

table of contents in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the united states patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory 
table of contents approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of our key management and scientific personnel 
if we fail to retain such key employees  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
we will have continuing obligations to indemnify the buyers of our commercial product lines  and may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our commercial product lines 
we agreed to indemnify eisai and king under certain circumstances pursuant to the asset purchase agreements we entered into with eisai and king in connection with the sale of our commercial product lines 
some of our indemnification obligations still remain and our potential liability in certain circumstances is not limited to specific dollar amounts 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 
the sale of our commercial product lines does not relieve us of exposure to product liability risks on products we sold prior to divesting these product lines 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us may not be insured and could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 
if our partners do not reach the market with our alliance products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if our partners are not effective in marketing our alliance products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
our competitors might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than our partners can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us or our partners  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 
we use hazardous materials  which may expose us to significant liability 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties 
we believe that we carry reasonably 
table of contents adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
we engage one or more third parties to manage some of our cash consistent with an investment policy that allows a range of investments and maturities 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss are to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
as a result of changes in the credit market  one of our short term investments in commercial paper is in default 
we intend to pursue collection efforts  but we might not recoup some or all of our investment in the commercial paper 
in addition  from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
we may require additional money to run our business and may be required to raise this money on terms which are not favorable to us or which reduce our stock price 
we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our drug development programs will require substantial additional future funding which could hurt our operational and financial condition 
our drug development programs require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 
our future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and human studies  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing 
table of contents technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in our existing collaborations  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we expect our research and development expenditures over the next three years to continue to be significant 
however  we base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables 
such uncertainties include regulatory approvals  the timing of events outside our direct control such as product launches by partners and the success of such product launches  negotiations with potential strategic partners  possible sale of assets or other transactions and other factors 
any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities from cash generated from avinza and promacta royalties and royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so  we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
significant returns of products we sold prior to selling our commercial businesses could harm our operating results 
under our agreements to sell our commercial businesses  we remain financially responsible for returns of our products sold before those businesses were transferred to their respective buyers 
consequently  if returns of those products are higher than expected  we could incur substantial expenses for processing and issuing refunds for those returns which  in turn  could negatively impact our financial results 
the amount of returns could be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  ongoing product demand  product rotation at distributors and wholesalers  and product stability issues 
our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn 
our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
our investment securities consist primarily of money market funds  corporate debt obligations and us government agency securities 
we do not have any auction rate securities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effects on various securities markets 
we cannot provide assurance that our investments are not subject to adverse changes in market value 
if our investments experience adverse changes in market value  we may have less capital to fund our operations 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of neurogen  metabasis and or pharmacopeia and realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers 
in december  we completed our merger with pharmacopeia 
in  we completed our merger with neurogen and in january  we completed our merger with metabasis 
the success of these mergers will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  growth opportunities and cost savings from integrating pharmacopeia s  neurogen s and or metabasis business with our business 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of pharmacopeia  neurogen and or metabasis 
the integration of independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
it is possible that the integration processes could result in the loss of key employees  diversion of each company s management s attention  the disruption or interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  any of which could adversely affect either company s ability to maintain relationships with licensors  collaborators  partners  suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger  or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and  as a result  adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect to incur significant costs and commit significant management time integrating pharmacopeia s  neurogen s and metabasis business operations  technology  development programs  products and personnel with those of ours 
if we do not successfully integrate the business of pharmacopeia  neurogen and metabasis  the expenditure of these costs will reduce our cash position 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
many factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including  but not limited to  the following factors results of or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the success of our collaboration agreements  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra  formerly the national association of securities dealers  inc and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of finra 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 
any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
while no material weaknesses were identified as of december   we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods 
the existence of one or more material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be 
table of contents required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
impairment charges pertaining to goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets from our mergers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
the total purchase price pertaining to our mergers with pharmacopeia and neurogen have been allocated to net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development and goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price  operating results and results of operations 
we may acquire companies  businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time consuming 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  or issue additional shares  to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
as part of our efforts to acquire companies  business or product candidates or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks and other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we acquire product candidates  we will also need to make certain assumptions about  among other things  development costs  the likelihood of receiving regulatory approval and the market for such product candidates 
our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 
in addition  we will likely experience significant charges to earnings in connection with our efforts  if any  to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that are ultimately not consummated  these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur  as part of a transaction  substantial charges for closure costs associated with elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired in process research and development charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods

on december   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of pharmacopeia  inc  or pharmacopeia 
pharmacopeia was a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to address significant medical needs 
pharmacopeia s strategy was to retain the rights to product candidates at least to clinical validation  and to continue with i development on its own new drug application  or nda  filings and ii commercialization for selected indications 
pharmacopeia had a broad portfolio of clinical and preclinical candidates under development internally or by partners 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of neurogen corporation  or neurogen 
as consideration  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to neurogen stockholders  or approximately shares of our common stock for each outstanding neurogen share  as well as approximately million in cash 
security holders of neurogen also received contingent value rights  under which they could receive cash payments under certain circumstances 
neurogen was a drug development

neurogen has conducted its drug development independently and  when advantageous  collaborated with world class pharmaceutical companies to access additional resources and expertise 
on january   we completed the acquisition of metabasis therapeutics  inc  or metabasis  following approval of the transaction by metabasis stockholders 
as a result  we gained a fully funded partnership with hoffman la roch  or roche  additional pipeline assets and drug discovery technologies and resources 
we paid million in cash or about per metabasis share to metabasis stockholders 
in addition  metabasis stockholders received four tradable contingent value rights cvrs  one cvr from each of four respective series of cvrs  for each metabasis share

bazedoxifene is a synthetic drug that was specifically designed to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures while at the same time protecting breast and uterine tissue 
regarding viviant  the fda has advised that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications 
approvable letters were received for each of these ndas  in which  among other things  the fda requested further analyses and discussion concerning the incidence of stroke and venous thrombotic events  identified certain issues concerning data collection and reporting  and requested additional source documents 
an fda requested advisory committee meeting is expected to be scheduled following submission of the complete response to the approvable letters 
in april  pfizer received approval in the eu for conbriza the eu trade name for viviant for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture 
we expect conbriza to be launched in the eu in pfizer is also developing bazedoxifene in combination with premarin aprela as a tissue selective estrogen complex under development for menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis 
two phase iii studies with bazedoxifene conjugated estrogens aprela showed reduced number and severity of hot flashes in symptomatic postmenopausal women by up to percent when compared with placebo 
pfizer expects to file an initial nda no earlier than the first half of we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on these products

uncertainties include our inability to predict the outcome of complex research  our inability to predict the results of clinical studies  regulatory requirements placed upon us by regulatory authorities such as the fda and emea  our inability to predict the decisions of our collaborative partners  our ability to fund research and development programs  competition from other entities of which we may become aware of in future periods  predictions of market potential from products that may be derived from our research and development efforts  and our ability to recruit and retain personnel or third party research organizations with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform certain research

risks factors for additional discussion of the uncertainties surrounding our research and development initiatives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for and million for the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of expenses incurred during as a result of exiting a facility  reduced legal expenses of million and lower headcount costs of million 
the decrease in general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to lower headcount related expenses of million which included one time severance benefits of million in connection with our restructuring  and stock compensation charges of million incurred in connection with the equitable adjustment of stock options  reduced outside consulting and audit fees of million and reduced occupancy cost of million 
these reductions were partially offset by a million charge for exit costs when we fully ceased use of one of our leased facilities in the first quarter of and increased legal expenses of million primarily related to litigation with the salk institute for biological studies  or salk  and rockefeller 
lease termination costs in august  we entered into a lease termination agreement for our corporate facility in san diego 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay a termination fee of million as follows million was paid upon signing  million in july and million in april as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded lease termination costs of million  which includes the net present value of the lease termination payments of million and million of other costs associated with the lease termination 

table of contents write off of in process research and development for acquisitions prior to january   the fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects  which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition  were immediately expensed 
we wrote off the estimated fair value of million of acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of pharmacopeia  inc in the estimated fair value relates to specific internal and partnered product candidates targeting a variety of indications which are currently in various stages of development ranging from preclinical to phase ii 
due to the nature of our internal development programs and our collaborative partnerships  management does not expect to incur significant costs related to these programs 
the estimated fair value is driven by future milestones and royalties 
management anticipates potential milestones in the near term and the possibility of significant royalties beginning in however  as these potential products have not reached commercialization  we or our partners face risks inherent in the development of products in the human health care market and will continue to face significant risks as no assurance can be given that product development efforts will be successful  required regulatory approvals for any indication will be obtained  any products  if introduced  will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or  patient and physician acceptance of these products will be achieved 
these risks may cause significant delays in the timing or potential success of commercialization of these products  which could materially impact estimated future cash flows 
of the total fair value  million relates to product candidates currently in the preclinical stage of development as follows million related to various candidates under our collaboration with gsk  million related to the jak program with wyeth  and related to our internal ccr program  million relates to product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials as follows million related to schering plough oncology related product candidates and million related to a product candidate being developed by celgene targeting inflammation  and million relates to product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials as follows million related to schering plough s cxcr program targeting copd and asthma and million related to a p mapk inhibitor program targeting rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis being developed by bms 
we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired in process research and development  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of for product candidates in the preclinical stage  for product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials and for product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired inprocess research and development may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition 
as a result of adjustments to our purchase price allocation related to our acquisition of pharmacopeia  we wrote off an additional million of acquired in process research and development during the year ended december  accretion of deferred gain on sale leaseback in october  we entered into an agreement with slough for the sale of our real property located in san diego  california for a purchase price of million 
this property  with a net book value of million  included one building totaling approximately  square feet  the land on which the building is situated  and two adjacent vacant lots 
as part of the sale transaction  we agreed to lease back the building for a period of years 

table of contents we recognized an immediate pre tax gain on the sale transaction of million in and deferred a gain of million on the sale of the building 
the deferred gain was being recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the lease at a rate of approximately million per year

table of contents critical accounting policies certain of our policies require the application of management judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates made 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition royalties on sales of avinza and promacta are recognized in the quarter reported by the respective partner 
promacta royalties are recorded net of amounts due to other parties 
revenue from research funding under our collaboration agreements is earned and recognized on a percentage of completion basis as research hours are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under our collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and we have no further performance obligations relating to that event  and ii collectibility is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
co promote termination accounting as part of the termination and return of co promotion rights agreement that we entered into with organon in january  we agreed to make quarterly payments to organon  effective for the fourth quarter of  equal to of avinza net sales through december  and thereafter through patent expiration  currently anticipated to be november the estimated fair value of the amounts to be paid to organon after the termination million as of january  based on the future estimated net sales of the product  was recognized as a liability and expensed as a cost of the termination as of the effective date of the agreement  january in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which approximated million as of december  
as organon has not consented to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event of king s default of this obligation 
therefore  we recorded an asset on february  to recognize king s assumption of the obligation  while continuing to carry the co promote termination liability in our consolidated financial statements to recognize our legal obligation as primary obligor to organon 
this asset represents a non interest bearing receivable for future payments to be made by king and is recorded at its fair value 
as of december  and thereafter  the receivable and liability will remain equal and adjusted each quarter for changes in the fair value of the obligation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
annually management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in 
table of contents determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december  and  the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future undiscounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
in december  the irs issued to us a nopa seeking an increase to our taxable income for the fiscal year of million and a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we responded to the nopa in february  disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the irs in the nopa 
we recorded a fin liability of million related to the income tax effect of the nopa and million related to estimated interest due on the proposed underpayment of tax 
we also recorded deferred income tax assets of million associated with the ability to carry back losses from and to offset the nopa 
in addition  we recorded an income tax receivable of million associated with changes in income tax law in relation to prior amt taxes paid on carry back periods 
we have not recorded the penalties proposed by the irs in our financial statements as we believe that we met the appropriate standard for the tax position on our tax return 
if we are unsuccessful in our negotiations with the irs  we may be required to pay the million penalty and utilize a significant amount of our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as recoverability was uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost for awards to employees and non employee directors is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests 
compensation cost for consultant awards is recognized over each separate tranche s vesting period 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  associated with option awards  restricted stock and an equitable adjustment of employee stock options 
of the total compensation expense associated with the option awards for  million related to the equitable adjustment of the exercise price for all options outstanding as of april  that was measured for financial reporting purposes effective march   the date our compensation committee of our board of directors approved the adjustment 

table of contents the fair value for options that were awarded to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the expected term of the employee and non employee director options is the estimated weighted average period until exercise or cancellation of vested options forfeited unvested options are not considered based on historical experience 
the expected term for consultant awards is the remaining period to contractual expiration 
volatility is a measure of the expected amount of variability in the stock price over the expected life of an option expressed as a standard deviation 
in selecting this assumption  we used the historical volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation would impact the amount of compensation expenses recognized during the period 
new accounting pronouncements the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification  or codification  as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification has changed the manner in which us gaap guidance is referenced  but did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
asu is effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we also have certain equipment financing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
due to the relative insignificance of such arrangements  however  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
