item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook  our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described under risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements as discussed elsewhere in this form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
our company we are one of the world s largest and oldest lessors of intermodal containers and chassis 
intermodal containers are large  standardized steel boxes used to transport freight by ship  rail or truck 
because of the handling efficiencies they provide  intermodal containers are the primary means by which many goods and materials are shipped internationally 
chassis are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
we operate our business in one industry  intermodal transportation equipment  and have two business segments equipment leasing we own  lease and ultimately dispose of containers and chassis from our lease fleet  as well as manage containers owned by third parties 
equipment trading we purchase containers from shipping line customers  and other sellers of containers  and resell these containers to container traders and users of containers for storage or one way shipment 
operations our consolidated operations include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of multiple types of intermodal containers and chassis 
as of december   our total fleet consisted of  containers and chassis  including  containers under management for third parties  representing  twenty foot equivalent units teu 
we have an extensive global presence  offering leasing services through offices in countries and third party container depot facilities in countries as of december  our customers are among the world s largest shipping lines and include  among others  apl nol  cma cgm  maersk line  mediterranean shipping company and nyk line 
for the year ended december   our twenty largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  our five largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  and our largest customer accounted for of our leasing revenues 
we primarily lease three principal types of equipment dry freight containers  which are used for general cargo such as manufactured component parts  consumer staples  electronics and apparel  refrigerated containers  which are used for perishable items such as fresh and frozen foods  and special containers  which are used for heavy and oversized cargo such as marble slabs  building products and machinery 
we also lease chassis  which are used for the transportation of containers domestically  and tank containers  which are used to transport bulk liquid products such as chemicals 
we also finance port equipment  which includes container cranes  reach stackers and other related equipment 
our in house equipment sales group manages the sale process for our used containers and chassis from our equipment leasing fleet and buys and sells used and new containers and chassis acquired from third parties 

table of contents as of december   the percentages of our equipment fleet and leasing revenues by equipment type are as follows equipment type percent of total fleet units percent of leasing revenue dry refrigerated special chassis tank equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total the following tables provide the composition of our equipment fleet as of the dates indicated below in both units and teu s equipment fleet in units december  december  december  owned managed total owned managed total owned managed total dry refrigerated special tank chassis equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total percentage equipment fleet in teu s december  december  december  owned managed total owned managed total owned managed total dry refrigerated special tank chassis equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total percentage we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  finance leases and service leases 
long term leases  typically with initial contractual terms ranging from three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
service leases command a premium per diem 
table of contents rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
we also have expired long term leases whose fixed terms have ended but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments pursuant to the terms of the initial contract 
some leases have contractual terms that have features reflective of both long term and service leases and we classify such leases as either long term or service leases  depending upon which features we believe are more predominant 
the following table provides a summary of our lease portfolio by lease type  based on total on hire units as of the dates indicated below lease portfolio december  december  december  long term leases finance leases service leases expired long term leases units on hire total during  we reached agreements with several of our customers that limit the total number of containers that could be returned from expired leases 
we have included the maximum number of containers that can be returned during the limitation periods as expired term leases  while the balance of the affected units are included in current term leases 
as of december   our long term leases had an average remaining contract term of approximately months  assuming no leases are renewed 
operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gain or loss that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 
our leasing revenues are primarily driven by our owned fleet size  utilization and average rental rates 
in  our leasing revenues decreased throughout the year due to a shrinking fleet size  a drop in utilization and decreasing leasing rates 
as of december   our owned fleet included  teus  a decrease of from december  the decrease in fleet size during was mainly due to the small amount of new containers purchased in combined with our normal disposal of used containers 
according to clarkson research services clarkson  global containerized trade volumes decreased by approximately in  and our shipping line customers aggressively decreased the number of containers in their fleets  especially in the first two quarters of the year 
as a result  the size of our idle container inventory rapidly increased during the first half of  and we significantly reduced our level of fleet investment 
container trade volumes and related container lease demand began to recover during the second half of this improvement in demand has reduced the number of our idle containers  and we have re started fleet investment in the first quarter of in  we sold approximately  teus of our owned containers  or of our owned equipment leasing fleet as of the beginning of the year 
this annual disposal rate is in line with the to annual disposal rate we have been experiencing for the last several years  and is generally consistent with our expected long term average disposal rate given the year expected useful life of our containers 
however  the rate of our disposals in did not keep pace with the rate at which older units were returned off lease  and the portion of our fleet designated as available for sale 
table of contents increased from as of december  to as of december  based on our increased inventory of containers available for sale  the age profile of our leasing fleet and scheduled lease expirations  we expect that our rate of disposals will increase when the market for used container disposals improves and then remain at an above average level for several years before decreasing significantly for several years thereafter 
during years of above average disposals  our teu growth rate and leasing revenues may be constrained if we are unable to generate a sufficient number of attractive lease transactions for an expanded level of new container investment 
our average utilization was in the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  ending utilization decreased from as of december  to as of december  the decrease in our utilization during was mainly due to the decrease in global containerized trade volumes and the resulting weak demand for leased containers  especially for leased dry containers 
during  dry container drop offs were high and pick ups exceptionally low for the first half of the year as our shipping line customers reacted to reduced trade volumes by decreasing the size of their operated containers fleets 
in the second half of the year  a partial recovery of trade volumes led to reduced dry container drop off volumes  improved container pick ups and a partial recovery in our utilization 
the improved market conditions have continued into  and we expect our utilization to continue to trend up in the first quarter of utilization and leasing demand for our refrigerated containers remained solid in despite the weak economic environment 
the utilization of our refrigerated containers does not heavily influence our overall utilization since they represent only of the units in our fleet 
however  these container types are significantly more expensive than dry containers  generate higher per diem lease rates and currently represent approximately of our leasing revenues 
utilization of our special containers also remained relatively healthy in  though we are seeing signs that leasing demand for special containers is weakening 
leasing demand for our chassis product line remained weak during due to ongoing weakness in us containerized imports and an oversupply of chassis in the marketplace 
the following tables set forth our equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below average utilization year ended december  quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  ending utilization december  september  june  march  utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease by the total units in our fleet excluding new units not yet leased 
average lease rates for our dry container product line in were lower compared to the average level in the decrease in average lease rates in primarily reflects the impact of lease extension transactions and other incentives provided to our customers  such as free or discounted usage periods  to encourage them to keep or pick up containers 
in addition  lease rates for containers placed on hire in were much lower than our portfolio average  while a significant portion of the containers returned to us have been from our higher per diem short term leases 
we expect our average lease rates for dry containers to gradually improve in if the recent improvement in market 
table of contents conditions is sustained  as discount periods expire and as containers are supplied to leases at higher rates 
average lease rates for refrigerated containers in were lower compared to  while average rental rates for our special containers were lower during compared to the decrease in average lease rates for our refrigerated containers was primarily due to lease rate concessions provided to certain customers for lease extension transactions 
in addition  market leasing rates for new refrigerated containers are still below our portfolio average rates due to lower container prices  so we generally expect our average rates for refrigerated containers to continue to trend down 
the decrease in average leasing rates for special containers was primarily due to discounts associated with lease extension transactions and weaker demand 
during  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to a million gain in the decrease compared to mainly resulted from a decrease in selling prices for our used containers 
used container selling prices decreased this year due to weak demand for used containers as well as the slowdown in global containerized trade and the resulting increase in worldwide idle container inventories 
in addition  in we recorded a million loss on new factory units placed on a finance lease 
these units were purchased in when equipment prices were historically high and we leased them out in at a lower implied price per container 
we recognize an up front gain or loss when we place existing equipment on finance leases and the market value of the equipment is different from our net book value 
we do not incur up front gains or losses when we place existing equipment on operating leases 
during  we recognized a net equipment trading margin of million on the sale of equipment purchased for resale  compared to an million margin in in  our trading volume was considerably lower than in due to the weaker disposal environment and our decision to reduce our purchases of trading equipment in order to focus our efforts on the sale of our owned equipment 
in addition  our per unit trading margin was pressured by decreasing used container selling prices in our ownership expenses  principally depreciation and interest expense  increased by million  or in as compared to although we purchased very few new containers during we invested heavily in containers during and this resulted in the average book value of our revenue earning assets increasing in as compared to depreciation increased in compared to  primarily due to new equipment purchases made throughout which had a full year s depreciation in interest expense increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in our effective interest rate 
for  our provision for doubtful accounts was million  down from a provision of million in during  we experienced several small customer defaults which were largely offset by a partial reversal of provisions made in due to better than expected container recoveries 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded sizable credit provisions primarily due to the default on a finance lease by one of our customers  and we recorded additional provisions to increase the loss reserves for the remaining leases in the finance lease portfolio 
while our provisions for doubtful accounts were limited in  we remain concerned that we may see an increase in the number and size of customer defaults due to the ongoing severe market conditions our customers are facing 
many of our customers were in the middle of major expansion programs when trade volumes collapsed at the end of  and vessel capacity is expected to increase for the next several years despite the recent reduction in trade volume growth 
the combination of reduced trade volumes and increasing vessel capacity has led to substantial decreases in freight rates on the major trade lanes  and many shipping lines reported large losses during while our collections performance in was solid and the average number of days outstanding for our receivables 
table of contents remained close to where it was at the beginning of the year  several of our customers  including a few major shipping lines  missed contractual payment dates during the year 
in addition  several major shipping lines  including our largest customer  are currently involved in comprehensive financial restructuring negotiations with their major creditors 
if one of our major customers defaulted on our leases and ceased operations because of deterioration in its financial performance  we would face reduced revenues and we would likely incur significant write offs due to lost units and recovery expenses 
we do not maintain an equipment reserve for units on lease to performing customers  so a major customer default would have a significant impact on our financial statements at the time the major customer defaulted 
to mitigate this impact from potential defaults  we entered into a credit insurance policy in the third quarter of that in certain circumstances covers losses and costs incurred in default situations 
however  this policy has significant deductibles  exclusions and payment and other limitations  and therefore may not protect us from losses arising from customer defaults 
our direct operating expenses were million in  compared to million in we incurred significantly more repair and storage costs in due to the increased level of drop offs and idle containers 
dividends we paid the following quarterly dividends during the years ended december  and on our issued and outstanding common stock record date payment date aggregate payment per share payment december  december  million september  september  million june  june  million march  march  million november  december  million august  september  million may  june  million march  april  million treasury stock we repurchased the following amounts of treasury shares year shares purchased amount paid  million  million  million

in  we negotiated the early termination of several contracts for fees of approximately million 
as of december   approximately million of these fees remain categorized as deferred revenue and will be recognized as units are redelivered  fee and ancillary lease revenue as well as finance lease revenue remained relatively unchanged from the level 
equipment trading activities 
equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds on the sale of equipment purchased for resale 
equipment trading expenses represent the cost of equipment sold  including costs associated with the acquisition  maintenance and selling of trading inventory  such as positioning  repairs  handling and storage costs  and estimated direct selling and administrative costs 
year ended december  dollars in thousands equipment trading revenues equipment trading expenses equipment trading margin the equipment trading margin decreased million compared to the trading margin decreased by million due to a lower per unit trading margin and by million due to a lower volume of units sold 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in selling costs and administrative expenses related to the volume of units sold 
we typically experience a lag of several 
table of contents months between the time that we buy and sell used containers  and in periods of falling prices inventory losses reduce our sales margins 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses primarily consist of our costs to repair equipment returned off lease  to store the equipment when it is not on lease  and to reposition equipment that has been returned to locations with weak leasing demand 
direct operating expenses were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
the primary reasons for the increase are outlined below million increase in storage costs due to an increase in units off hire  million increase in repair costs due to a higher repair volume  primarily for our dry and refrigerated containers  million decrease in surveying costs due to a decrease in new equipment purchases  and million decrease in other operating costs due to lower positioning costs in administrative expenses 
administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was mainly due to lower employee incentive costs of million  lower foreign exchange losses of million  lower travel expenses of million  and lower consulting fees of million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
depreciation increased by million due to a larger depreciable fleet  resulting from our large investment in equipment in this increase was partially offset by a million decrease due to another vintage year of older equipment becoming fully depreciated in the fourth quarter of and a million decrease due to disposals 
provision for doubtful accounts 
there was a provision for doubtful accounts of million for  compared to million for  a decrease of million

net gain on sale of leasing equipment 
gain on sale of equipment was million for  compared to a gain of million for  a decrease of million 
gain on sale decreased million due to lower selling prices and higher selling costs 
in addition  in we recorded a million loss on new factory units placed on a finance lease

unrealized gain on interest rate swaps was million for  compared to an unrealized loss million for the net fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a net liability of million at december   compared to net liability of million at december  the decrease in the liability resulted from an increase in long term interest rates during income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for  compared to million for  and the effective tax rates were in and in the effective tax rate was lower than primarily due to a decrease in the required state rate in the company records income tax expense  with the majority of the expense recorded as a deferred income tax liability on the balance sheet 
we expect this deferred liability to increase for the foreseeable future 
due to the availability of net operating loss carryovers and continued accelerated tax depreciation for our equipment  the company currently does not pay any significant federal  state or foreign income taxes

interest rates on the majority of our debt obligations are based on floating rate indices such as libor 
we economically hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our long term borrowings by entering into interest rate swap contracts 
asset backed securitization term notes our asset backed securitization program was the primary funding source used to finance our existing container fleet and new container purchases from the program s inception in april of through the conversion of the term note series to a term loan in april the term note series issued in april was used to finance the majority of the containers in our fleet at that time  and the term notes series was primarily used to finance our new container purchases between april and april the term note series automatically converted to a nine year amortizing term loan as of april  the borrowing capacity under the abs program is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days plus restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to a range of to of original equipment cost depending on equipment type 
under the abs program  we are required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in a designated bank account equal to five months of interest expense

the facility has a revolving credit period and the current borrowing capacity under this facility is million 
the revolving period ends june   on which date the facility will convert to a term loan and amortize in equal monthly installments through june the interest rate margin will increase by basis points when this facility is converted to a term loan 
the borrowing capacity under the asset backed credit facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to a range of to of original equipment cost depending on equipment type 
asset backed credit facility on october   we entered into a million asset backed credit facility  which was increased to million on december  the facility initially has a month revolving credit period  commencing on the date of the facility  followed by a four year term period 
the term notes amortize on a level basis over the four year period to of the outstanding balance 
the interest rate margin will increase by basis points if the facility is converted to a term loan at the end of the revolving credit period 
the borrowing capacity under the asset backed credit facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to a range of to of original equipment cost depending on equipment type 
under the asset backed credit facility  we are required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in a designated bank account equal to three months of interest expense 
revolving credit facility on august   we entered into a revolving credit agreement 
the current commitment under the revolving credit facility is million and the maturity date is august  we are required to maintain unencumbered assets equivalent to of the maximum commitment 
finance lease facility on july   we entered into a million credit facility to support the growth of our finance lease business the finance lease facility 
the finance lease facility had a two year revolving period which preceded a ten year term in which the outstanding balance  as of the term conversion date  amortizes in monthly installments 
the finance lease facility is secured by the finance lease receivables associated with certain containers 
the finance lease facility has a final maturity of july the borrowing capacity under the finance lease facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the lesser of the original equipment cost or the net present value of the minimum lease payments discounted using the facility rate at the time of borrowing 

table of contents term loan facility on november   we entered into a three year term loan  which is secured by approximately  teu of previously managed dry and special containers that we purchased on october  the final maturity date of the loan is november  our initial borrowing under this facility of million was made on november  we made an additional borrowing under this facility of million on january  pursuant to a lender commitment dated december  the borrowing capacity under the term loan facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days 
the net book value for purposes of the borrowing base calculation is the equipment acquisition cost depreciated at an annual rate of

the port equipment facility has an eight year term and amortizes in equal monthly installments 
capital lease obligations we have entered into a series of capital leases with various financial institutions to finance the purchase of chassis 
the lease agreements have been structured as ten year terminal rental adjustment clause trac leases with purchase options at the end of the lease terms equal to the trac amount as defined in each lease 
for income tax purposes  these leases are treated as operating leases 
in august and december  we entered into sale leaseback transactions for approximately  and  of containers for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
the leases were accounted for as capital leases with interest expense recognized on a level yield basis over seven years  at which point there are early purchase options

contractual obligations we are party to various operating leases and are obligated to make payments related to our long term borrowings 
we are also obligated under various commercial commitments  including obligations to our equipment manufacturers 
our equipment purchase obligations are in the form of conventional accounts payable  and are satisfied from cash flows from operating and or long term financing activities

off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire 
table of contents for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not reasonably assured is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification no 
revenue recognition asc  we recognize billings to customers for damages and certain other operating costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
as principal  we are responsible for fulfillment of the services  supplier selection and service specifications  and we have ultimate responsibility to pay the supplier for the services whether or not we collect the amount billed to the lessee 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option that enables the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenues and expense equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of equipment purchased for resale and is recognized as units are sold and delivered to the customer 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management fee income we manage equipment which is owned by third parties and we earn management fees based on the income earned by the leasing and sales of such equipment 
management fees are recognized as services are provided 
we collect amounts billed and pay operating costs as agent on behalf of the third parties that own such equipment 
these billings and operating costs are not included in revenue and expense  instead  the net amounts owed to these equipment owners are reflected as accrued expenses in our financial statements until paid as required by our contracts 
other revenues other revenues include fee income for third party positioning of equipment 
leasing equipment in general  we purchase new equipment from equipment manufacturers for the purpose of leasing such equipment to our customers 
occasionally  we may also purchase used equipment with the intention of leasing such equipment 
used units are typically purchased with an existing lease in place or were previously owned by one of our third party owner investors 
leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
we will continue to review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in our depreciation policies  useful lives of our equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
if indicators of impairment are present  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of our fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
leasing equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recovered 
key indicators of impairment on leasing equipment include  among other factors  a sustained decrease 
table of contents in operating profitability  a sustained decrease in utilization  or indications of technological obsolescence 
when testing for impairment  leasing equipment is generally grouped by equipment type  and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities 
some of the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine future undiscounted cash flows and the measurement for impairment are the remaining useful life  expected utilization  expected future lease rates  and expected disposal prices of the equipment 
we consider the assumptions on expected utilization and the remaining useful life to have the greatest impact on our estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
these estimates are principally based on historical experience and management s judgment of market conditions 
estimated useful lives and residual values have been principally determined based on our historical disposal experience 
the estimated useful lives and residual values for our leasing equipment from the date of manufacture are currently as follows useful lives years residual values dry container units to refrigerated container units  to  special container units to  tank container units chassis costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we charge to expense inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and include these costs in direct operating expenses 
an allowance is provided through provision for doubtful accounts based on the net book value of a percentage of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing which we believe we will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on our historical experience 
equipment held for sale when leasing equipment is returned off lease  we make a determination of whether to repair and re lease the equipment or sell the equipment 
at the time we determine that equipment will be sold  we reclassify the appropriate amounts previously recorded as leasing equipment to equipment held for sale 
in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
property  plant and equipment asc  equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its estimated fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell  or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within days 
subsequent changes to the asset s fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments may not exceed the equipment s carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net gain loss on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a gain loss on sale of leasing equipment  and cash flows associated with the disposal of equipment held for sale are classified as cash flows from investing activities 

table of contents equipment held for resale trading activity on an opportunistic basis  we purchase used equipment with markings or specifications different from our own equipment for purposes of reselling it within a short time frame for a net profit 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as equipment held for sale due to the short timeframe  generally less than one year  between the time the equipment is purchased and the time the equipment is sold 
due to this short expected holding period  cash flows associated with equipment held for resale are classified as operating cash flows 
equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of this equipment  while equipment trading expense includes the cost of equipment sold  any costs to sell such equipment  including administrative costs  and costs associated with the inventory such as storage and handling charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectability of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if applicable  we accrue income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions by evaluating whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit and then measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc 
asc requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded million of goodwill 
management determined that the company has two reporting units  equipment leasing and equipment trading  and allocated million and million  respectively  to each reporting unit 
the annual impairment test is conducted by comparing the company s carrying amount  to the fair value of the company using a market capitalization approach 
market capitalization of the entity is compared to the carrying value of the entity since virtually all of the goodwill is allocated to  and nearly 
table of contents all of the market capitalization is attributable to  the equipment leasing reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the entity exceeds its market capitalization  then a second step would be performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any excess fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our annual review of goodwill  conducted in the fourth quarter of  indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative diclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is in derivative asset positions counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with highly rated financial institutions 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current exposures and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   we had in place total interest rate swap contracts to fix the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under our debt facilities as summarized below total notional amount at december  weighted average fixed leg interest rate at december  weighted average remaining term  million years changes in the fair value on these interest rate swap contracts will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps 
since of our debt is hedged using interest rate swaps  our interest expense is not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
however  our earnings are impacted by changes in interest rate swap valuations which cause gains or losses to be recorded 
during the year ended december   unrealized gains on interest rate swaps totaled million  compared to unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the large majority of our leases and company obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in and were denominated in us dollars 
however we pay our non us staff in local 
table of contents currencies  and our direct operating expenses and disposal transactions for our older containers are often structured in foreign currencies 
we recorded million of unrealized foreign currency exchange losses in the year ended december  and million of unrealized foreign currency exchange losses in the year ended december   which resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates related to our euro and pound sterling transactions and related assets 
in april  we entered into a foreign currency rate swap agreement to exchange euros for us dollars based on expected payments under its euro denominated finance lease receivables 
the foreign currency rate swap agreement expires in april the fair value of this derivative contract was approximately million at december   and is reported as an asset in fair value of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet
