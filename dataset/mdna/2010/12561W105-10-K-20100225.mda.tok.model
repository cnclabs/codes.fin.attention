cleco power also is subject to the jurisdiction of ferc with respect to rates for wholesale service  accounting  interconnections with other utilities  and the transmission of power and reliability 
periodically  cleco power has sought and received from both the lpsc and ferc increases in base rates to cover increases in operating costs and costs associated with additions to generation  transmission  and distribution facilities 
cleco power s electric rates include a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
revenue from certain off system sales to other utilities and energy marketing companies is passed on to customers through a reduction in fuel cost adjustment billing factors 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to refund until monthly approval is received from the lpsc  however  all amounts are subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
the lpsc fuel adjustment clause general order issued november   in docket no 
u provides that an audit will be performed not less than every other year 
cleco power currently has fuel adjustment clause filings for through subject to audit 
in july  the lpsc informed cleco power that it was planning to conduct a periodic fuel audit that included fuel adjustment clause filings for the period january through december in march  the lpsc indicated its intent to proceed with the audit for the years through the total amount of fuel expenses included in the audit is approximately billion 
the audit is expected to proceed in the first quarter of cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of these audits  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in july  cleco power s current rsp with the lpsc  which governs its retail regulatory return on equity  was extended with modifications to certain terms until the commercial operation date of rodemacher unit  which was on february  during  the lpsc approved the recovery of a portion of the carrying costs of capital associated with the construction of rodemacher unit also during  the lpsc approved an interim rate increase to recover storm restoration costs incurred by cleco power relating to hurricanes katrina and rita 
in march  after completing a review of the restoration costs  cleco power and the lpsc staff filed a settlement agreement allowing recovery of million  essentially all of cleco power s hurricanes katrina and rita storm costs 
the agreement also authorized the issuance of securitized bonds to finance the restoration costs 
the collection of a special storm recovery charge from cleco power s customers will securitize the bonds 
the lpsc approved the settlement agreement and issued a securitization financing order in september in march  the securitization financing was completed  collection of the interim surcharge ceased  and the right to bill and collect unamortized storm damage costs from customers was sold to cleco katrina rita  a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary of cleco power 
in july  the lpsc issued docket no 
u subdocket a  which provides for an environmental adjustment clause to recover certain costs of environmental compliance as an adder to the customers bills 
the costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal  state  and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by sale of such allowances 
also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs  which are the cost of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are used to reduce air emissions 
these variable emission mitigation costs were historically recovered through the fuel adjustment clause

cleco power s rate case in july  cleco power filed a request with the lpsc for a new rate plan to increase its base rates for electricity 
cleco power sought recovery of revenues sufficient to cover the addition of rodemacher unit to its existing expense and rate base levels 
cleco power and the lpsc staff filed testimony in support of an uncontested stipulated settlement in september in october  the lpsc voted unanimously to approve the retail rate plan for cleco power 
the retail rate plan became effective upon the commercial operation of rodemacher unit  which occurred on february the retail rate plan is expected to increase retail base revenues  in the first twelve months of rodemacher unit commercial operations  by approximately million with an anticipated net billing decrease for retail customers of approximately million  or assuming a gas price of mmbtu  including a reduction of approximately million resulting from the cessation of the collection and the refund of rodemacher unit construction financing based on a five year crediting period 
the retail rate plan also provides for the recovery of other costs including costs associated with damage caused by hurricanes gustav and ike 
the retail rate plan includes a formula rate plan frp that has a target return on equity of  including returning to retail customers of retail earnings between and and all retail earnings over 
the capital structure assumes an equity ratio of 
the frp also has a mechanism allowing for recovery of future revenue requirements for the acadiana load pocket transmission project and the acquisition of of the acadia power station  or one of its two mw units 
the retail rate plan allows cleco power to propose additional capital projects for inclusion in the frp to the lpsc during the frp s initial four year term 
franchises cleco power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units  such as municipalities and parishes counties  and enforced by state regulation 
these franchises are for fixed terms  which may vary from years to years or more 
in the past  cleco power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each neared the end of its term 
cleco power s next municipal franchise expires in renewed franchises cleco power renewed the following franchise agreements during no franchises were renewed in date city term number of customers january coushatta years may bunkie years may abita springs years july simmesport years september mansfield years other franchise matters in july  the city of opelousas notified cleco power that it would begin formally requesting proposals from other power companies to supply its electricity needs 
the current agreement is set to expire in august in november  the city of opelousas received responses from power companies from which it solicited bids declining its request for proposals to provide power to the city 
the mayor formed a citizens committee to determine if the city of opelousas should operate its power system or continue the operating and franchise agreement with cleco power 
in december  the city of opelousas requested an extension under the operating and franchise agreement to perform the review 
cleco power granted an extension until december  for the twelve month period ended december   cleco power s base revenue from the city of opelousas was million 
approximately  customers are located in the city of opelousas 
while the city of opelousas owns a portion of the power system  cleco power has performed upgrades and expansions since may  which was the inception of the operating and franchise agreement 
if the operating and franchise agreement is not renewed by the city of opelousas  the city of opelousas will be liable to cleco power for the cost of the upgrades and expansions of approximately million

environmental matters environmental quality cleco is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties 
cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations  and management believes cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits  as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
environmental requirements continue to increase as a result of new legislation  administrative actions  and judicial interpretations 
therefore  the future effects of existing and potential requirements are difficult to determine 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco s capital expenditures related to environmental compliance were million during and are estimated to total million in the following table lists capital expenditures for environmental matters by subsidiary 
subsidiary thousands environmental capital expenditures for projected environmental capital expenditures for cleco power evangeline acadia total represents aph s portion of acadia represents aph s remaining portion of acadia subsequent to cleco power s purchase of one mw unit of acadia projected environmental capital expenditures for are lower than environmental capital expenditures primarily due to a project that was completed in related to the epa s spill prevention containment and countermeasure rules and the installation of upgrades to the so system at cleco power s dolet hills power station that is expected to be completed during air quality the state of louisiana regulates air emissions from each of cleco s generating units through the air quality regulations of the ldeq 
in addition  the ldeq has been delegated authority over and implements certain programs established by the epa 
the ldeq establishes standards of performance and requires permits for certain generating units in louisiana 
all of cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements 
the federal caa established a regulatory program  known as the acid rain program  to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on so emissions from certain generating units 
the federal caa requires these generating stations to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of so emitted beginning in the year the epa allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions 
as of december   cleco power and midstream had sufficient allowances for operations and expect to have sufficient allowances for operations under the acid rain program 
the acid rain program also established emission rate limits on nox emissions for electric generating units egus 
cleco power s low nox burner project was installed in to achieve compliance with the reduced acid rain permit limits for nox at dolet hills 
with its low nox burner project completed  rodemacher unit is able to achieve compliance with the acid rain nox limits by a greater margin 
significant future reductions in nox emissions limits may require additional capital improvements at one or both of the units 
nox emissions from the evangeline and acadia generating units are within the units respective permitted limits  as these units use modern turbine and selective catalytic reduction technology that reduces nox emissions to low levels 
on march   the clean air interstate rule cair was finalized by the epa 
cair covered the district of columbia and eastern states  including louisiana  and provides a federal framework requiring states to reduce emissions of so and nox via a cap and trade emission reduction program 
cair called for nox reductions to begin in the year and so reductions in louisiana promulgated state regulations to incorporate these federal cleco corporation cleco power form k requirements 
the federal rule has been heavily litigated by multiple parties in the case known as north carolina vs 
epa 
on july   the us court of appeals for the us circuit vacated the cair rule in its entirety 
then  after rehearing the case  the dc circuit court on december  reinstated the cair rule and directed the epa to conduct further proceedings consistent with the court s opinion in the case 
the court determined that  notwithstanding the flaws of cair  remanding it to the epa without vacature was preferable in that it preserved the environmental benefits of the rule 
as a result  cair went into effect in its entirety on january  and will remain in effect until the epa re writes the rule to address the flaws identified by the court in the initial cair rule 
the epa does not have a specified timeframe to complete the new rule  however  cleco expects the epa to propose a replacement rule in early with a final rule completed in early at this time  cleco cannot determine what the new rule requirements will entail  to what extent compliance costs would be increased  or what level of capital expenditures would be required to comply with the new rule 
cleco had previously evaluated potential compliance strategies to meet the emission reductions contemplated by the initial cair regulations 
the installation of new low nox burners and enhancements to the so scrubber at dolet hills were expected to be an integral part of meeting the cair nox and so reduction provisions 
likewise  the installation of the new low nox burners at rodemacher unit in will help meet cair nox reduction requirements 
cleco will rely on its previous compliance strategy to meet the current cair requirements and also may include additional emission controls  purchase of allowances  or fuel changes to enhance its compliance  if warranted 
on march   the epa issued final rules regarding mercury emissions from electric utility boilers known as the federal clean air mercury rule camr 
camr established standards of performance limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and created a market based cap and trade program 
however  on february   the us court of appeals for the us circuit in new jersey v 
epa  vacated both the epa s rule delisting coal and oil fired egus from regulation under section of the caa and the entire camr rule 
since the supreme court denied industry petitions to review the appeals court decision  camr is officially vacated 
egus are subject to regulation under section  which will require the epa to promulgate maximum achievable control technology mact standards for hazardous air pollutants for coal and oil fired egus 
the epa is now moving forward to set mact standards for these units which will require that new sources must adopt at minimum the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source  as determined by the administrator and existing sources must adopt emission controls equal to the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing source 
the epa is requiring certain coal and oil fired facilities to perform stack testing to help determine what these emission rates will be for the best performing percent of existing sources 
the epa has entered into a consent decree with various environmental groups which require them to promulgate proposed mact standards for egus by march and final standards by november typically  the epa allows three years after promulgating a final rule for the regulations to become effective 
these new standards will likely contain emission limits not only for mercury but for other hazardous air pollutants 
on january   the epa issued guidance directing state permitting authorities to make case by case mact determinations  consistent with the requirements of section g of the caa  for coal and oil fired egus that began actual construction or reconstruction between march  and march  rodemacher unit is a unit that began construction between the dates in question  and was permitted as a minor source within the context of what constitutes hazardous air pollutants under section g rules 
cleco does not believe that case by case mact applies to rodemacher unit and on march   cleco received a letter from the ldeq concurring with its position 
the ldeq is ultimately responsible for making a determination regarding the applicability of case by case mact to rodemacher unit as such  dolet hills and rodemacher units and should all be treated as existing units under the new mact rules once they are finalized 
congress continues to consider various climate related bills that require the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg by emission sources in the us on june   the us house of representatives voted to pass the american clean energy and security act of aces 
the bill includes an economy wide ghg cap and trade program that requires a reduction in ghg emissions from major us sources of by and by compared to levels 
the bill also imposes a renewable electricity standard for utilities of up to by  and addresses other issues such as energy efficiency  carbon capture and sequestration and performance standards for new coal units permitted after under aces  approximately of emission allowances would be freely allocated during the early years of the cap and trade program 
over time  however  a greater percentage of allowances would be auctioned  eventually requiring full auctions after members of the senate are also considering climate change legislation 
the senate environment and public works committee passed the kerry boxer bill out of committee in november this bill mirrors the aces legislation passed by the house but has a stricter ghg reduction target by each of the current bills being considered  if enacted  could potentially have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
similar material effects would also potentially be realized by other companies in the electric generating industry that rely heavily on fossil fuels to produce electricity 
moreover  it is unclear when  if ever  climate change legislation that includes a cap on greenhouse gas emissions will be enacted by the federal government  and if enacted  what the specific provisions of the legislation will be and when such provisions will take effect 
cleco corporation cleco power form k in addition to congress considering climate change legislation  the epa has initiated actions toward regulating ghg under the existing caa 
in december  the epa promulgated its long awaited endangerment finding 
the agency s finding states that elevated atmospheric concentrations of six ghg  which include carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide  hydrofluorocarbons  perfluorocarbons  and sulfur hexafluoride  are contributing to climate change 
although the endangerment finding technically is being made in the context of ghg emissions from new motor vehicles  the finding will trigger ghg regulation of a variety of mobile and stationary sources under the caa 
the first ghg regulation that the epa will issue will be its light duty motor vehicle ghg regulation  which cleco expects will be issued by march this regulation is being issued jointly with the department of transportation and primarily requires improvements in fuel economy for automobiles and light duty trucks beginning in model year the epa states that once the motor vehicle ghg regulations become effective  which cleco expects to be in may or june of  ghg will be considered regulated pollutants under the prevention of significant deterioration psd air quality permit program 
as a result  new major stationary sources of ghg emissions  and modifications of existing major stationary sources that significantly increase their ghg emissions will be required to obtain a permit setting forth best available control technology bact for those emissions 
at this time  bact has not been defined for these major stationary sources 
both the epa and businesses in general have a high level of concern for how bact will be determined and that a very large number of sources could be required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions when ghg become regulated pollutants 
as a result  to avoid grid locking the psd permit system  the agency has proposed a tailoring rule designed to limit applicability of the psd program to only the largest ghg emitters  at least for an initial five year period 
under the tailoring rule  major sources to which psd requirements for ghg would become applicable would be those that emit more than  tons per year of co equivalent  and a significant increase of ghg emissions from a modification would be defined at a level between  and  tons per year 
the tailoring rule would also set a  ton per year threshold under the title v operating permit program 
the legality of the tailoring rule has been questioned because the caa explicitly defines the psd major source threshold as tons per year for sources in industrial categories and tons per year for sources in all other categories  and the title v threshold at tons per year 
regulations adopted by the epa could potentially have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
for example  cleco may be required to obtain authorization for greenhouse gas emissions from all new and modified facilities in psd and title v permits  or upon renewal of such permits for existing facilities 
such facilities may be required to meet then current bact requirements  which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
however  at this time  due to several factors including the anticipated legal challenges to various epa greenhouse gas rules  it is unclear when  if ever  such rules would be finalized and if finalized  when relevant rule provisions would become effective 
uncertainty as to whether epa rules and or federal legislation regulating greenhouse gases will become effective complicates cleco s decision making process for modifying existing facilities or adding new power generating facilities 
the enactment of federal or state renewable portfolio standards rps mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources  such as wind  solar  biomass and geothermal  could result in certain changes in cleco s business or its competitive position 
these changes could include costs for renewable energy credits  alternate compliance payments  or capital expenditures for renewable generation resources 
rps legislation has been enacted in many states and congress could continue to pursue legislation to create a national rps 
states such as louisiana that do not have rps requirements could adopt such requirements in the future or be subject to federal rps requirements 
cleco continues to evaluate the impacts of potential rps legislation on its businesses based on the rps programs in other states 
cleco will continue to monitor developments related to rps at the federal and state levels 
on march   the epa set new national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone  the new primary hour ozone standard is set at parts per million ppm and the new secondary standard at a form and level identical to the primary standard 
the previous primary and secondary standards were each effectively set at ppm 
the previous standard was set in and louisiana had five parishes in the baton rouge area that had not yet attained compliance with the standards 
in march  the ldeq made its initial non attainment designations to the epa under the ozone standards 
this designation added several parishes in louisiana designated as non attainment with the ozone naaqs standards 
cleco has no generating facilities in any of the newly designated or existing non attainment parishes 
the state was to make the initial designations by june  final designations by and by  promulgate regulations on how louisiana would comply 
however  on january   the epa proposed to set the primary standard  which protects public health  at a level between and ppm measured over eight hours 
the epa is also proposing to set a separate secondary standard to protect the environment  especially plants and trees 
the agency is expected to issue a final decision on revising the standards by august since nox emissions are a precursor to ozone formation  existing fossil fuel fired units located in or near these newly designated ozone non attainment areas that do not currently utilize best available control technology could be targeted for installation of additional nox emission controls 
in february  cleco power received notices from the epa requesting information relating to the rodemacher and dolet hills power stations 
the apparent purpose of the investigation is to determine whether cleco power has complied with new source review and new source performance cleco corporation cleco power form k standards requirements under the caa in connection with capital expenditures  modifications  or operational changes made at these facilities 
cleco power has completed its response to the initial data request 
it is unknown at this time whether the epa will take further action as a result of the information provided by cleco power 
on march   cleco power received a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty co nopp from the ldeq for alleged violations of the air quality rules at its dolet hills and rodemacher power stations 
for dolet hills  the co nopp alleges that upon a file review conducted on or about february   the ldeq found that cleco power was in violation of conditions in its title v permit regarding compliance assurance tests to be conducted upon its continuous monitoring systems 
upon review of the ldeq findings and the part regulations  cleco power contends that the actions taken were allowed under the part regulations  as well as the title v permit 
in regard to the rodemacher power station alleged violations  the co nopp states that a file review of the rodemacher facility was conducted on or about september   and that upon the agency s review of the quarterly stack emissions reports required under cfr part submitted by cleco power  the ldeq found that rodemacher unit exceeded opacity limits at various times during the second  third and fourth quarters of on december   cleco and the ldeq entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties agreed to settle the enforcement matter for approximately  and the matter is now closed 
on september   dolet hills power station received a notice from epa region  alleging that the facility may be in violation of the accident prevention requirements of section r of the caa and the chemical accident prevention provisions in cfr part the epa claims that the facility may have been required to have a risk management plan rmp for the chemical anhydrous ammonia  which is used and stored on site 
the epa alleges that dolet hills exceeded the threshold quantity of  pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a single process  which triggers the requirement to have such a plan in place 
the epa made this claim after a review of their central data exchange  which includes information submitted to the epa in the toxic release inventory 
in the notice  the epa has offered to settle the matter  which would include the payment of a non negotiable penalty of  and the correction of the alleged deficiencies 
cleco power contends that dolet hills employed administrative controls to limit the quantity of ammonia stored to less than  pounds which was sufficient to exempt the facility from the rmp program requirements 
cleco power provided the epa with documentation supporting its position  the epa has determined that cleco is in compliance and the matter is closed 
water quality cleco has received from the epa and the ldeq permits required under the federal clean water act for waste water discharges from its five generating stations 
waste water discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration  and cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods 
the ldeq issued a louisiana pollutant discharge elimination system lpdes waste water permit renewal for evangeline power station on june  this waste water permit contained certain additional copper and total dissolved solids tds permit limitations that cleco contended were beyond the legal authority of the ldeq to include in the waste water permit 
cleco challenged these permit provisions by filing a de novo review judicial appeal on september   in district court in east baton rouge parish  louisiana 
the appealed copper and tds permit limitations were stayed during litigation 
the uncontested portions of the evangeline waste water permit were effective january  during the litigation  cleco and the ldeq were actively engaged in settlement discussions regarding the appealed provisions of the waste water permit 
in december  cleco filed an application with the ldeq modifying its lpdes permit to incorporate new copper and tds discharge limitations that were agreed to by both parties 
on august   the ldeq issued a modified water permit with the agreed upon copper and tds limits which the facility expects to be able to meet 
the effective date of the modified permit is october  the modified permit resolves the issues on appeal  and the matter is now closed 
on may   the acadia power station became subject to certain daily maximum and monthly average discharge limitations for total sulfate under the terms of lpdes water discharge permit no 
la  issued by the ldeq in april the facility was unable to achieve compliance with these discharge limitations and received a compliance order from the ldeq on july  to address the total sulfate violations 
in that compliance order  the ldeq also noted violations of various daily maximum temperatures and whole effluent toxicity limits 
the ldeq also found that acadia had previously corrected and resubmitted discharge monitoring reports for four months in  which the ldeq contends are not timely submittals 
the ldeq included these violations as well as the total sulfate violations in the compliance order 
acadia believes that the total sulfate limits in the lpdes permit were erroneously low and as such applied for a permit modification to increase the total sulfate limitations in the permit 
acadia has now received a modified water discharge permit from the ldeq which contains increased total sulfate limitations that can be met by the facility 
acadia is operating in compliance with and under the terms of the modified lpdes permit and has requested that the ldeq close the compliance order 
however  the ldeq does have the ability to seek enforcement action on the violations of the water discharge permit limits experienced prior to the receipt of the water discharge permit modification 
for each of the violations described above  the ldeq has the right to seek civil penalties 
at this time  acadia is unable to determine whether the ldeq will pursue any civil penalties as part of this enforcement action or what the penalty amounts will be 
in  the epa promulgated phase ii of section b of the clean water act which regulates potential adverse cleco corporation cleco power form k environmental impacts to all aquatic species due to water intake structures 
these regulations establish requirements applicable to the location  design  construction  and capacity of cooling water intake structures 
this section of the rule is applicable to cleco s teche and evangeline power stations 
the rule was immediately challenged by a coalition of environmental groups and six states 
in  the us court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that some of the provisions of the rule were unlawful and remanded the rule to the epa for re consideration 
most importantly  the court concluded that the approach used by the epa to eliminate closed cycle cooling as the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts for cooling water intake structures was not clear and potentially based on unlawful consideration of the closed cycle cooling costs relative to its benefits 
industry appealed the second circuit decision on whether the epa could consider technology costs relative to its benefits to the us supreme court and in april the us supreme court overturned the lower court s ruling and ruled that the epa does have the discretion to consider costs relative to benefits in developing cooling water intake structure regulations under this rule 
the decision gives the epa the option to retain substantial features of its july phase ii final rule  which set reasonable national performance standards for existing electric generating facilities  while also allowing variances based on cost benefit considerations 
the epa has indicated that it plans to propose a revised phase ii rule by late and a final rule some time in until the epa promulgates a replacement phase ii rule  the epa has indicated that it will ask permit writers to use best professional judgment in evaluating permit renewals until a new b rule is promulgated 
at this time  it is uncertain which technology option  if any  will be required to be installed on cleco s intake structures and the associated costs of those modifications 
solid waste disposal the solid waste division of the ldeq has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations 
cleco has received all required permits from the ldeq for the on site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations 
cleco has renewed the solid waste permits for the existing rodemacher and dolet hills solid waste units and is in the process of upgrading them according to the current solid waste regulations and permit requirements 
these upgrades are not expected to result in substantial costs 
a catastrophic event involving coal ash at the tennessee valley authority s coal ash management impoundment in kingston  tennessee has prompted closer scrutiny by the epa of coal ash management facilities at coal fired power plants across the country 
cleco power  like most utilities with coal fired units  received a formal request  to which it has fully responded  for information under section e of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act rcra regarding the safety and structural integrity of its coal ash management units 
after reviewing the data collected  the epa has indicated its preference to listing coal combustion by products  including fly ash  bottom ash  boiler slag  and flue gas desulfurization solids including synthetic gypsum  as rcra subtitle c hazardous wastes 
regulating coal ash as a subtitle c hazardous waste could have significant impacts on cleco s coal ash management units at its rodemacher and dolet hills power stations 
cleco expects the epa to propose new coal ash management rules in early due to the uncertainty of the content of the proposed rule  cleco cannot quantify or estimate the cost impacts such a rule might have on its operations 
however  any new  stricter requirements imposed on coal ash and associated management units by the epa as a result of this new rule could significantly increase the cost of operating existing units or require them to be upgraded 
these proposed rules could also thwart the beneficial reuse of the material that cleco currently enjoys 
at this time  management is unable to determine whether the costs associated with potential stricter requirements will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
hazardous waste generation cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its five generating stations and at other locations 
cleco does not treat  store long term  or dispose of these wastes on site  therefore  no permits are required 
all hazardous wastes produced by cleco are properly disposed of at federally permitted hazardous waste disposal sites 
toxic substances control act tsca the tsca directs the epa to regulate the marketing  disposal  manufacturing  processing  distribution in commerce  and use of pcbs 
cleco may continue to operate equipment containing pcbs under the tsca 
once the equipment reaches the end of its usefulness  the epa regulates handling and disposal of the equipment and fluids containing pcbs 
within these regulations  the handling and disposal is allowed only through the epa approved and permitted facilities 
cleco properly disposes its pcb waste material at tsca permitted disposal facilities 
toxics release inventory tri the tri requires an annual report from industrial facilities on about substances that the facilities release into air  water  and land 
the tri ranks companies based on how much of a particular substance they release on a state and parish county level 
annual reports are due to the epa on july following the reporting year end 
cleco has submitted required tri reports on its activities  and the tri rankings are available to the public 
the rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties 
electric and magnetic fields emfs the possibility that exposure to emfs emanating from electric power lines  household appliances  and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects or damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention 
cleco cleco corporation cleco power form k power funds scientific research on emfs through various organizations 
to date  there are no definitive results  but research is continuing 
lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and or property values have arisen in several states 
cleco power is not a party in any lawsuits related to emfs 
other in october  cleco received a special notice for remedial investigation and feasibility study from the epa 
the special notice requested that cleco corporation and cleco power  along with many other listed prps  enter into negotiations with the epa for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study at an area known as the devil s swamp lake just northwest of baton rouge  louisiana 
the epa has identified cleco as one of many companies sending pcb wastes for disposal to the site 
the devil s swamp lake site has been proposed to be added to the national priorities list npl based on the release of pcbs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site 
the epa has yet to make a final determination on whether to add devil s swamp lake to the npl 
the epa and a number of prps met in january for an organizational meeting to discuss the background of the site 
the prps began discussing a potential proposal to the epa in february negotiations among the prps and the epa are ongoing in regard to the remedial investigation and feasibility study at the devil s swamp site  with little progress having been made since the january meeting 
the prps alleged to have disposed pcbs at the site have proposed a tentative cost sharing formula with the facility owner to fund the remedial investigation 
the response to the proposal has been pending for months 
since this investigation is in the preliminary stages  management is unable to determine whether the costs associated with possible remediation of the facility site will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the registrants 
global economic downturn the global economic downturn may negatively impact cleco s business and financial condition 
the current economic downturn may have an impact on cleco s business and financial condition 
cleco s ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when cleco would like  or need  to do so  which could have a material adverse impact on its ability to fund capital expenditures or debt service  or on cleco s flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
if cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit ratings were to be downgraded by moody s or by standard poor s  cleco corporation or cleco power  as the case may be  would be required to pay additional fees and higher interest rates under its bank credit and other debt agreements 
cleco s pension plan portfolio has experienced significant volatility due to market conditions and may experience material losses in the future 
the losses  in conjunction with plan funding requirements  could result in required pension plan contributions significantly higher and earlier than previously anticipated  which could have a material adverse impact on cleco s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
further  the current economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on cleco s lenders or its customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to cleco or to delay payment of such obligations 
additionally  the current economic downturn could lead to reduced electricity usage  which could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations and financial condition 
future electricity sales cleco power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
general market conditions can negatively impact the businesses of cleco power s industrial customers  resulting in decreased power purchases and lower base revenue 
the current u 
s 
recession has led to reduced power usage by cleco power s industrial customers 
industrial kwh sales in were down from levels 
lower sales to industrial customers were largely the result of decreased production at one of cleco power s large industrial customers and a large customer beginning to cogenerate a portion of its electricity requirements 
cleco power s largest industrial customers  specifically those who manufacture wood and paper products who generated million in base revenue in  have experienced a downturn in their respective markets 
the paper industry has been vulnerable in recent years due to decreasing demand for the product  and the downturn in residential home construction has also caused a significant reduction in the demand and prices for lumber and other wood products 
reduced production or the shut down of any of these customers facilities could substantially reduce cleco power s base revenue 
for example  in a paper manufacturer announced the closing of a plant in cleco power s service territory  which is expected to decrease base revenue by million from levels 
future electricity sales could be impacted by industrial customers switching to alternative sources of energy  including on site power generation  and retail customers consuming cleco corporation cleco power form k less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or increased electric usage efficiency 
fuel cost audits the lpsc conducts fuel audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
the lpsc fuel adjustment clause general order issued november   in docket no 
u provides that an audit will be performed not less than every other year 
cleco power currently has fuel adjustment clause filings for through subject to audit 
in july  the lpsc informed cleco power that it was planning to conduct a periodic fuel audit that included fuel adjustment clause filings for january through december in march  the lpsc indicated its intent to proceed with the audit for the years through the total amount of fuel expenses included in the audit is approximately billion 
the audit is expected to proceed in the first quarter of cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of these audits  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the most recent audit completed by the lpsc covered and and resulted in a refund of million to cleco power s retail customers in the first quarter of hedging and risk management activities cleco power is subject to market risk associated with economic hedges relating to open natural gas contracts 
cleco has risk management policies which cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities 
cleco power utilizes economic hedges to mitigate the risks associated with a fixed price wholesale power contract that is not included in the fuel adjustment clause 
any realized gain or loss attributable to these hedges is recorded on the income statement as a component of operating revenue  net 
accordingly  changes in the market value of these hedging arrangements caused by natural gas price volatility will impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power also has entered into economic hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the fuel adjustment clause in the month the physical contract settles 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not be as effective as planned  particularly if intentional misconduct is involved  and cannot eliminate all risk associated with these activities 
transmission constraints transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
because of cleco power s location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  physical constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory  which in turn can affect capacity or power purchases under long term contracts  as well as spot market power purchases 
if the amount of purchased power actually delivered into cleco s transmission system were less than the amount of power contracted for delivery  cleco power may rely on its own generation facilities to meet customer demand 
cleco power s incremental generation cost at that time could be higher than the cost to purchase power from the wholesale power market  thereby increasing its customers ultimate cost 
in addition  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover part or all of its incremental generation cost  which could be substantial 
commodity prices cleco power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of various commodities which may increase the cost of producing power 
cleco power purchases coal  lignite  natural gas  petroleum coke  and fuel oil under long term contracts and on the spot market 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas  petroleum coke  and coal have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
cleco power s retail rates include a fuel adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power generation facilities cleco power s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  and interruption of fuel deliveries 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel supply interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
some of cleco power s facilities were originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or availability  or in compliance with its environmental permits 
cleco corporation cleco power form k if cleco power fails to make adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance  cleco power risks incurring more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel or power purchase costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
newer equipment  such as that installed at rodemacher unit  can be subject to startup issues  such as failures due to immaturity of control equipment safeguards and experience with operating under forced outage conditions 
equipment manufacturer warranty coverage will be subject to proof of cleco power s proper operation of the equipment 
cleco power s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal  natural gas  petroleum coke  and lignite 
the deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
if the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel  cleco power would have to replace any deficiency with alternative sources  which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of fuel to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered from customers through the fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the lpsc 
competition for access to other natural resources  particularly oil and natural gas  could negatively impact cleco power s ability to access its lignite reserves 
land owners may grant other parties access for oil and natural gas drilling in the same area to which cleco has been granted access for lignite reserves 
placement of drilling rigs and pipelines for developing oil and gas reserves can preclude access to lignite in the same areas  making right of first access critical with respect to extracting lignite 
competition for the right of first access may need to be determined through legal processes 
additionally  cleco power could be liable for the impacts of other companies activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by cleco power 
loss of access to the lignite reserves or the liability for impacts on reclaimed lands could have material adverse effects to the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
ero in  ferc s authority was expanded to include the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards on the transmission system  as well as the capacity to impose fines and civil penalties on those who fail to comply with those standards 
the energy policy act of authorized the creation of an ero with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards  subject to ferc approval  for users of the nation s transmission system 
in july  ferc named nerc as the ero 
ferc has approved numerous reliability standards developed by nerc 
a final order was issued by ferc in march  and in june  ferc began enforcing compliance with these standards 
new standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified 
as these standards continue to be adopted and modified  they may impose additional compliance requirements on cleco power  acadia  and evangeline operations  which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
failure to comply with the reliability standards approved by ferc can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties 
cleco is scheduled for an audit by spp  the rto for cleco s region  in april management is currently unable to predict the outcome of the audit and whether the result will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
environmental compliance cleco s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant 
the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities  could be significant to the registrants 
cleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal  state  and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  and health and safety 
cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities 
existing environmental laws  regulations  and permits could be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to cleco 
for example  congress is considering climate change legislation that  if ultimately enacted  could impose a cap on co emissions by electric generating units and subject these units to an emissions allowance based trading system 
cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations  and new requirements 
if cleco fails to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations  and requirements  it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce productions from its facilities 
environmental advocacy groups  states  other organizations  some government agencies  and the presidential administration are focusing considerable attention on emissions from power generation facilities  including co emissions  and their potential role in climate change 
future changes in environmental regulations governing power plant emissions could make some of cleco s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the cleco corporation cleco power form k lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  there could be a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
regulatory compliance cleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the registrants businesses or result in significant additional costs 
cleco s business is subject to extensive federal  state  and local energy  environmental and other laws and regulations 
the lpsc regulates cleco s retail operations  and ferc regulates cleco s wholesale operations 
the construction  planning  and siting of cleco s power plants and transmission lines also are subject to the jurisdiction of the lpsc and ferc 
additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of cleco s operations and construction projects including the epa  the united states bureau of land management  the united states fish and wildlife services  the united states department of energy  the united states army corps of engineers  the united states department of homeland security  the occupational safety and health administration  the united states department of transportation  the ldeq  the louisiana department of health and hospitals  the louisiana department of natural resources  the louisiana department of public safety  regional water quality boards  and various local regulatory districts 
cleco must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders 
should cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on cleco  cleco s business could be adversely affected 
existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to cleco or cleco s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on the registrants business or result in significant additional costs because of cleco s need to comply with those requirements 
weather sensitivity the operating results of cleco power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity  particularly kwh sales to residential customers 
in cleco power s service territory  demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months 
as a result  cleco power s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
in addition  cleco power has sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions were milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
severe weather  including hurricanes and winter storms  can be destructive  causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
retail electric service cleco power s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the lpsc 
cleco power s retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc  which conducts an annual review of cleco power s earnings and regulatory return on equity 
through  cleco power filed annual monitoring reports with the lpsc for month periods ended september in  the reports will be filed for month periods ended june and september beginning in  cleco power will file annual monitoring reports for the month period ended june cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the lpsc review  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
wholesale electric service cleco power s wholesale electric rates and business practices are regulated by ferc 
cleco power s wholesale rates are regulated by ferc  which conducts a review of cleco power s generation market power every three years  in addition to each time generation capacity changes 
if ferc determines cleco power possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds  cleco power could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market based rates within its control area  which could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco credit ratings a downgrade in cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit rating could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs and a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources 
while the senior unsecured debt ratings of cleco corporation and cleco power are currently investment grade  in recent years such ratings have been downgraded or put on negative watch by moody s and standard poor s 
cleco corporation or cleco power cannot assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
if moody s or standard poor s were to downgrade cleco corporation s or cleco power s long term ratings  particularly below investment grade  the value of their debt securities would likely be adversely affected  and the borrowing cost of cleco corporation cleco corporation cleco power form k or cleco power would likely increase 
in addition  cleco corporation or cleco power would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings and be subject to more onerous debt covenants  and its pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease 
interest rate swap cleco power has entered into an interest rate swap relating to its variable rate debt 
the effectiveness of this contract is dependent on the ability of the counterparty to perform its obligations and nonperformance could harm cleco power s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power utilizes interest rate swaps to offset the effects of interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate debt 
the effectiveness of these contracts is dependent  in part  upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations 
if the counterparties to the interest rate swaps are unable to perform their obligations  cleco power would be exposed to the effect of the fluctuations of the libor market on its variable rate debt and may have to pay increased interest expenses  which could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
holding company cleco corporation is a holding company  and its ability to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries 
cleco corporation is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries 
substantially all of cleco s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  cleco s ability to meet its debt obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries 
cleco s subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on cleco s debt or to make any funds available for such payment 
in addition  cleco s subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to cleco may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors 
moreover  cleco power  cleco s principal subsidiary  is subject to regulation by the lpsc  which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that cleco power may pay cleco corporation 
evangeline and acadia generation facilities the evangeline and acadia generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  interruption of fuel deliveries  and transmission constraints 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
if adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance are not made  a facility may incur more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
the evangeline and acadia generating facilities are fueled by natural gas 
the deliverability of this fuel source may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances  or lack of transportation capacity 
because of acadia s location on the transmission grid  acadia relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
however  at times  physical constraints limit the amount of power these transmission providers can deliver 
cleco power s rates the lpsc and ferc regulate the rates that cleco power can charge its customers 
cleco power s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs from its lpsc jurisdicational customers in a timely manner through its lpsc approved rates and its ability to pass through to its ferc customers in rates its ferc authorized revenue requirements 
cleco power s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital  including long term debt and equity 
if cleco power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital  the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases 
during those cases  the lpsc determines cleco power s rate base  depreciation rates  operation and maintenance costs  and administrative and general costs that cleco power may recover from its retail customers through its rates 
these proceedings may examine  among other things  the prudence of cleco power s operation and maintenance practices  level of subject expenditures  allowed rates of return  and previously incurred capital expenditures 
the lpsc has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred 
these regulatory proceedings typically involve multiple parties  including governmental bodies and officials  consumer advocacy groups  and various consumers of energy  who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates 
rate cases generally have long timelines  which may be limited by statute 
decisions are typically subject to appeal  potentially leading to additional uncertainty 
alternate generation technology changes in technology may negatively impact the value of the cleco power  evangeline  and acadia generation facilities 
a basic premise of cleco s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price 
there are cleco corporation cleco power form k alternate technologies to produce electricity  most notably fuel cells  microturbines  windmills  and photovoltaic solar cells 
research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies 
it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of most central station production 
also  as new technologies are developed and become available  the quantity and pattern of electricity usage by customers could decline  with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators 
in addition  the current presidential administration and us congress have voiced strong support for such alternative energy sources 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of specifically provides a total of billion to be available for energy related initiatives  primarily billion in renewable energy tax credits to encourage development of wind  solar  and other renewable energy sources  and billion for development of a smart grid in the us it is uncertain at this time to what extent these initiatives may impact cleco s businesses  except that little impact is expected in the short term 
as a result of these factors  the value of the cleco power  evangeline  and acadia generation facilities could be significantly reduced 
technology and terrorism threats man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may negatively impact the registrants operating results 
man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt the registrants operations and harm the registrants operating results 
the registrants operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
despite the implementation of security measures  all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking  viruses  acts of war or terrorism  and other causes 
if the registrants technology systems were to fail and the registrants were unable to recover in a timely way  the registrants would be unable to fulfill critical business functions  which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition  the cleco power  evangeline  and acadia generation plants  fuel storage facilities  transmission  and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their energy products 
any such disruption could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure the registrants assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows
