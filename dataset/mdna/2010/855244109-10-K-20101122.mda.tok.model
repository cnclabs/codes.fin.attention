overview starbucks results for fiscal demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts over the last two years to improve the health of our core business and to position the company for sustained  profitable growth into the future 
strong comparable stores sales growth of for the year us and international  combined with a more efficient operating structure drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings 
the operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal in our supply chain and company operated stores have driven reduced product costs and store waste as well as in store labor savings  concurrent with improved customer satisfaction scores 
these improvements were partially offset by higher performance based compensation expenses in fiscal and by higher marketing expenses to support the launch of starbucks via ready brew in the grocery channel and the introduction of our new customizable frappuccino blended beverage 
in our us business we will continue to refine our store efficiency efforts while pursuing a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
while the reinvigorated us business has been the primary driver of starbucks improved consolidated financial results  the profitability of our international business continues to improve  driven primarily by increased sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies 
our management continues to focus on our international business by leveraging the valuable lessons learned in the us 
we intend to capitalize on the large expansion opportunities that exist outside the us  including continued growth and scale in our more mature existing markets  and emphasis on expansion in key emerging markets like china and brazil 
our global consumer products group cpg represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution 
we are aggressively pursuing the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee products in multiple forms  across new categories  and through diverse channels  leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base 
examples include the ongoing expansion of our successful starbucks via ready brew product and the ongoing growth in points of distribution for seattle s best coffee 
starbucks continues to generate strong operating cash flows  which provide us the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment and spending in both our core business and new growth platforms  while also returning cash 
table of contents to shareholders 
we generated billion of operating cash flow in fiscal and finished the year with billion in cash and short term investments and no short term debt 
in fiscal we returned approximately million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends 
fiscal the view ahead for fiscal  we expect revenues to grow in the mid to high single digits based on a week comparable year  driven by low to mid single digit comparable store sales growth 
we plan to open approximately net new stores globally in fiscal  approximately in the us and approximately internationally  the majority of which are expected to be licensed stores 
we expect modest improvement in our consolidated operating margin in fiscal compared to the prior year  given our current revenue expectations  our anticipation of no restructuring charges in fiscal  along with ongoing marketing spend for starbucks via ready brew and higher coffee commodity costs 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million to million for the full year 
operating segment overview starbucks has three reportable operating segments us  international  and cpg 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we changed the composition of our reportable segments by creating a seattle s best coffee operating segment and reporting it with our unallocated corporate expenses and digital ventures in other 
financial information for seattle s best coffee was previously reported within the us  international  and cpg segments 
the us and international segments both include company operated retail stores and licensed retail stores 
licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee 
the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated compared to the us segment  however  the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature us segment has significantly more stores  and higher total revenues than the international segment 
average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 
further  certain market costs  particularly occupancy costs  are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment  which comprises a more diverse group of operations 
as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment  the number of stores  the higher unit volumes  and the lower market costs  the us segment  despite its higher relative percentage of company operated stores  has a higher operating margin  excluding restructuring costs  than the less developed international segment 
starbucks international store base continues to expand and as we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china and brazil 
newer international markets require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 
the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide  and the us foodservice business 
for over ten years through licensing relationships with kraft foods global  inc  we have sold a selection of starbucks and seattle s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us  and to grocery stores in canada  the uk and other european countries 
kraft has managed the distribution  marketing  advertising and promotion of these products 
in the first quarter of fiscal  starbucks notified kraft that we are discontinuing our licensing relationships 
we intend to work closely with kraft to ensure an orderly transition 
we also sell packaged coffee and tea internationally directly to warehouse club stores  such as costco wholesale corporation 
our cpg segment also includes ready to drink beverages which are manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership  a joint venture with the pepsi cola company 
in the cpg segment  most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready to drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner 
royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue  and the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture are included  on a net basis  in 
table of contents income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks 
the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues  a modest cost structure  and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the other two reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated results of operations in millions fiscal year ended oct  sep  change oct  sep  of total net revenues net revenues company operated retail specialty licensing foodservice and other total specialty total net revenues consolidated net revenues were billion for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in company operated retail revenues driven by a increase in global comparable stores sales contributing approximately million

with the previously announced store closures essentially complete  we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest 
also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately million 
the trading securities approximate a portion of the company s liability under the management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance  with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings 
this favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations approximately million  which relate primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables 
income taxes for the fiscal year ended resulted in an effective tax rate of compared to for fiscal the lower rate in fiscal was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement

commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk  generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products  among other things 
we purchase  roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee 
in addition to coffee  we also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company operated retail stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations 
for additional details see product supply in item  as well as risk factors in item a of this k 
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices  and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings 
we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 
in general  hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 

table of contents the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs  including coffee  dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results 
in addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of october   starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 
starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the hedging period 
the following table summarizes the potential impact to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates 
the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions october  increase decrease to net earnings increase decrease to oci increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate foreign currency hedges equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange traded funds within our trading portfolio 
the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the mdcp 
a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of the end of fiscal and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 

table of contents interest rate risk we utilize short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
at the end of fiscal years and  we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions october  change in fair value fair value basis point increase in underlying rate basis point decrease in underlying rate debt our available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments 
the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity 
as of october   our long term available for sale securities included ars 
please see note for further information 
available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available for sale securities 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider our policies on asset impairment  goodwill  stock based compensation  operating leases  self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
asset impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for store assets  the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future store revenues and operating costs  using internal projections 
for other assets  we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 

table of contents goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances  such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures  indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for consolidated entities in our third fiscal quarter 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance  and changes in our business strategies 
as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations  including estimated future cash flows  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
as a part of starbucks ongoing operations  we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease  among other reasons 
we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non transferrable assets 
under gaap  when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of  goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal 
our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment 
although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment  it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
as a result  when closing individual stores  we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets 
as noted above  if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period 
for stock option awards we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however  a change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year operating leases we lease retail stores  roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
we provide for an estimate of asset retirement obligation aro expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs 
future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 
in addition  the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which we have operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense  as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 

table of contents self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty  to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates
