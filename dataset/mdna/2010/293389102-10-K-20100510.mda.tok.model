overview the company we are one of the largest providers of business forms to independent distributors in the united states and are also one of the largest providers of blank t shirts in north america to the active wear market 
we operate in two reportable segments print and apparel 
our print business challenges in our print segment  we are engaged in an industry undergoing significant changes 
technology advances have made electronic distribution of documents  internet hosting  digital printing and print on demand valid  cost effective alternatives to traditional custom printed documents and customer communications 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in the print segment of our business transformation of our portfolio of products excess production capacity and price competition within our industry economic uncertainties the following is a discussion of these business challenges and our strategy for managing their effect on our print business 
transformation of our portfolio of products traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many are being replaced or devalued with advances in digital technologies  causing steady declines in demand for a large portion of our current product line 
the same digital advances also introduce potential new opportunities for growth for us  such as print on demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
we currently have many innovative products  such as our recently introduced healthcare wristbands  secure document solutions  and innovative in mold label offerings  which address important business needs  and we feel are positioned for growth 
in addition  we will continue to look for new market opportunities and niches  such as our addition of our envelope offerings  that provide us with an opportunity for growth and differentiate us from our competition 
transforming our product offerings to continue to provide innovative  valuable solutions to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make investments in new and existing technology and to develop key strategic business relationships 
excess production capacity and price competition within our industry paper mills continue to adjust production capacity through downtime and closures to attempt to keep in line projected customer demand with the available supply 
due to the limited number of paper mills  paper prices have been and are expected to remain fairly volatile 
in  we saw our material prices stabilize due to the depressed economic conditions 
however  we would expect paper mills to continue to increase paper prices  especially as the economy strengthens  and have already seen indications of paper price increases during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents despite a competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through increased paper costs  although it can often take several quarters to push these through due to the custom nature of our products and or contractual relationships with some of our customers 
we expect this trend to continue  however  weak economic conditions may limit our ability to recover all these costs 
in addition  poor economic conditions  have also resulted in increased price competition  due to an already over supplied market  which continues to put pressure on selling prices 
we attempt to effectively manage and control our product costs to minimize the effects of the foregoing on our operational results  through the use of forecasting models  production and costing models  etc 
however  an inherent risk in this process is that our assumptions are off  which could have a negative impact on our reported profit margins 
economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in our revenue during the past fiscal year 
although  we have seen slight improvements in some economic indicators within our markets  unemployment rates and other leading indicators continue to be strained 
a weak job market may continue to present a challenging environment for substantial revenue growth next fiscal year 
as we cannot predict the pace of the economic recovery  we will be highly focused on customer retention  expanding our growth targeted products and continuing to develop our new market niches 
in addition  we have proven a history of managing our costs and wouldn t expect this trend to change in the future 
our apparel business challenges in our apparel segment  our market niche is highly competitive  commodity driven and is generally dominated by a limited number of players 
the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and created an over supply situation which further increased competitive pressures in this market 
cotton  which represents of our costs  is a commodity product and subject to volatile fluctuations in price  due to general market conditions  domestic and international demand  perceived availability  international actions  etc 
as such  our operational costs are subject to significant swings  which we may or may not be passed on to the marketplace due to competitive or economic conditions  competitors pricing strategies  etc 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in our apparel segment business in fiscal cotton prices completion of our new manufacturing facility economic uncertainties cotton prices due to shortage of supply and other international factors  domestic cotton prices are at levels not seen in years  if ever 
whether or not prices will stay at this level for a sustained period of time is unknown 
however  as most manufacturers have already locked in a significant portion of their cotton buys for next year  a decline in spot cotton prices later this year would only have a marginal impact on overall calendar year blended costs 
we believe we are competitive with other companies in the united states apparel industry in negotiating the price of cotton and as such we do not feel we are at a competitive disadvantage from a cotton perspective 
however  it is unknown at this time whether the market will allow the manufacturers to pass these costs through and whether our competitors will in fact attempt to pass through these costs 
completion of new manufacturing facility we are building a state of the art manufacturing facility in agua prieta  mexico the project and expect construction to be completed during the nd quarter of fiscal  with production to start during the rd quarter of fiscal after the successful implementation of phase of the project  this facility will be able to process million pounds of fabric per week  with the eventual capacity  after phase implementation  being between million to million pounds per week 
during the initial ramp up of this facility  there will be considerable duplicate costs  inefficiencies  moving costs  etc 
that will have a negative impact on the apparel segment s fiscal year operating results 
our plan is to contain these costs to a large extent to fiscal year through an accelerated ramp up schedule 
we would expect the negative impact of the start up and ramp up costs of this facility will be approximately million to million 
however  the success of our plan is dependent on meeting key targets and a delayed start up wind down schedule could add significantly to these costs 
once fully operational  with sell through levels of million pounds to million pounds per week  and with anticipated manufacturing efficiency factors being realized  this facility is expected to generate between million to million in annualized cost savings per year 
economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in our revenue during the past fiscal year 
although we saw a significant increase in our revenues during our fourth quarter  and would expect such to continue during the first couple quarters of fiscal  continued high 
table of contents unemployment rates and continued weakness in the housing sector  along with international crisis could undermine the fragile state of the current economic recovery 
as we cannot predict the pace of the economic recovery  we will be highly focused on customer retention  expanding our growth targeted markets and managing our costs both the start up and operational costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan obligations  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status and associated liability recorded 
amounts allocated to amortizable intangibles are determined based on valuation analysis for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether a triggering event has occurred during the year that would indicate potential impairment 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
for example  in fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and million of goodwill and trademarks  respectively 
at february   our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
no impairment charge was required for the year ended february  based on the results of our annual impairment test 
the carrying value of invested capital for each reporting unit as compared to their fair value at february  was as follows carrying value of fair value of reporting unit invested capital invested capital apparel print we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
however  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairments or specific triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  we print and store custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million  and million of revenue were recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february   february   and february   respectively 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable 
table of contents based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended authoritative guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
the guidance became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   with an exception for the disclosures of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for fiscal years  and segment operating results this section provides an analysis of our net sales  gross profit margin and operating income by segment

our sales during the periods continued to be impacted by the significant economic downturn which began during the later part of our third quarter of fiscal year the volatile economic conditions of and and the resulting lower demand lead an already competitive market environment to a weaker selling price environment  as manufacturers tried to maintain their production levels market share 
while we competed based on price on a selected basis where it was deemed to be of strategic value  we decided to be much more cost side focused and bottom line driven  as a result  our sales declined by million  or during fiscal year ended and million or during fiscal year ended cost of goods sold 
due to our cost side focused approach during fiscal year and some favorable cotton pricing during the fourth quarter ended february   we were able to reduce our cost of goods sold by during fiscal year this resulted in our consolidated gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold increasing by basis points  from in fiscal to in fiscal our apparel margins increased from to  while our print margins increased from to  for fiscal years and  respectively 
during the later part of our third quarter of fiscal  the united states economy went into a severe economic downturn  which impacted both our apparel and print sales 
while the company adjusted its cost structure to be in line with its current run rate  it took a quarter or so to implement these costs reduction strategies and to fully understand the depths of the economic downturn 
this timing impacted the company s reported gross profit margins during this period 
in addition  our apparel segment experienced significant cost side pressures relating to material  freight  chemical and utilities during the period  as well as sell side pressures due to retail inventory reduction strategies and excess inventory levels at manufacturers 
as a result  our overall gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year our apparel margins decreased from to  while our print margins decreased from to  for fiscal years and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year as a percentage of sales these expenses remained the same for both years  while on a dollar basis  these expenses decreased primarily as a result of our continual cost control initiatives and the focus of being cost side driven during these difficult economic times 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year on a dollar basis  these expenses decreased primarily as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  lower employment and factoring expenses  offset by higher bad debt expense  associated with the bankruptcy filing of a large apparel customer and higher health insurance expense 
on a percentage basis  these expenses increased only slightly due to the timing impact of cost control initiative programs implemented 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and trademarks 
after conducting our fiscal year impairment testing  we determined million of goodwill and million trademarks associated with our apparel segment was impaired 
the impairment charge was primarily the result of the then current adverse economic conditions and the resulting impact on the financial market valuation multiples 
no impairment was required for the year ended february  based on the results of our annual impairment test 
gain from disposal of assets 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for fiscal year ended february  resulted from sale of equipment 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for the fiscal year ended february  resulted from  gain from sale of vacant facilities and  gain from sale of equipment 
income from operations 
our income from operations for fiscal year increased from an operational loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year the dollar increase in our operational earnings during fiscal year  related primarily to our improved consolidated gross profit margin  reduced selling  general and administrative costs  and the lack of a comparable non cash impairment charge in like we incurred in fiscal year our income from operations for fiscal year decreased from operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to an operational loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year the dollar decrease in our operational earnings during fiscal year  related primarily to the non cash impairment charge of million and decrease in our consolidated gross profit margin due to conditions discussed earlier 
other income and expense 
our interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our interest expense decreased in fiscal year and due to less outstanding debt on average as compared to each prior fiscal year and a lower effective borrowing rate during fiscal years and provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal year was impacted by the non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million 
net earnings 
our net earnings increased from a loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year to earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share increased from a loss of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased from a loss of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year the increase in net earnings during the period related primarily to the lack of a non cash impairment charge as was incurred in fiscal year our net earnings decreased from million  or of sales for fiscal year to a loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share decreased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to a loss of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share decreased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to a loss of per share for fiscal year the decrease in net earnings during the period related primarily to our decrease in sales and non cash impairment charge of million  as previously discussed 
segment operating results fiscal years ended net sales by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our print sales declined by million  or during the fiscal year and million or during fiscal year  when compared to the preceding fiscal year 
the decline in our print sales was primarily due to the severe economic recession which started during the later part of our third quarter of the fiscal year in addition to the general impact of the economic recession on our sales  the adoption of digital technologies continues 
table of contents to erode revenues from our traditional print 
the evolution to digital technology has been transpiring for some time now  and we would expect this continue into the future 
the turbulent economy also led to weaker pricing in an already competitive industry as our customers sought cost savings to improve their own profitability in the light of declining sales 
our decline in sales during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by increased sales from our acquisition of b d  skyline and trade which were acquired october  and september   respectively 
the positive impact of these acquired entities on sales was million for the fiscal year ended february  apparel segment 
the apparel segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment decreased by million  or over fiscal year  which in turn decreased by million or over fiscal the decrease in our fiscal year sales was generally contained to the first three quarters where we saw our apparel sales decline by million  or 
as the economy started to improve and retailers started to experience some comparable sales growth  we were able to partially offset this sales decline with a fourth quarter sales gain of million  or 
the decline in our apparel sales during fiscal year related primarily to the decline in our fourth quarter apparel sales  where apparel sales were down million  or 
due to the economic downturn which started around october or november of  our apparel sales were impacted by a sluggish retail landscape which contributed to inventory levels being reduced at the retail level and correspondingly increased at the manufacturers level 
this resulted in intensified pricing pressures in the marketplace  from both domestic and international competitors during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and fiscal year  which placed additional pressures on top lines and on operational margins 
fiscal years ended gross profit by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
our print gross profit margin margin  as a percent of sales  was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal we saw our material prices stabilize due to depressed economic conditions 
as such  we were able to fully realize the benefits associated with our costs control initiatives started during fiscal while this was a favorable factor during fiscal  going forward we would expect paper mills to continue to increase prices whenever possible  especially as the economy strengthens  and have already seen indications of paper price increases during the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in our print gross profit margin  as a percentage of sales  related primarily to increased material and freight costs which had not been fully passed on to our customers because of contractual obligations and or timing of the increases  product mix changes  and lower absorption due to our lower volume 
while costs increases impacted our margins  we were able  for the most part  to effectively offset these costs increases during the period through improved operational efficiencies 
apparel segment 
our apparel margin  as a percent of sales  was  and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we were able to increase our margin by basis points during fiscal year through focusing on the cost side of the equation 
cost control was a major factor in the improvement of our margin for gas prices were more favorable in as compared to and  combined with lower chemical and other input costs  helped to partially offset the reduction in sales for the year 
in addition all non essential overtime was eliminated and a period of day manufacturing was implemented in our main fabric producing plant in anaheim for a portion of the year without impacting our reported margin 
we were also able to take advantage  during the fourth quarter  of lower cotton prices which we had locked in at previously contracted prices earlier in the year when cotton was selling at a much lower price per pound 
our margins during fiscal year were significantly impacted by the severe economic downturn experienced which started during the later part of our third fiscal quarter  and the resulting impact on inventory levels and competitors pricing strategies 
in addition  our margins were negatively impacted by significant raw material price increases  as well as freight  chemical and energy costs increases during the period 
while several price increases occurred during the first six months of fiscal year  these increases only partially covered the actual costs 
table of contents increases incurred during this period 
in addition  customer mix changes ie  more sales to larger lower pricing tiered customers  and product mix changes ie  shift in sales to lower profit margin items also impacted the reported margin during this period 
during the second half of the year  due to the severe economic downturn  retailers significantly reduced their on hand inventory levels  which in turn resulted in increased inventory at the manufacturing level 
this resulted in increased pricing pressures in the market place  at a time when manufacturers were still trying to recoup their material production cost increases experienced during the first six months of the year 
as a result  manufacturers top lines were impacted two fold by a reduction in units sold  and by a reduction in selling price  which placed additional strains on manufacturers margins during the fourth quarter 
in addition  margins were further impacted during the period by lower manufacturing levels as manufacturers adjusted their production to demand levels which decreased their manufacturing absorption factors 
our apparel segment wasn t immune to this  as we saw our margins decline from to on a comparable th quarter basis 
fiscal years ended profit by segment in thousands print apparel total less corporate expenses earnings loss before income taxes print segment 
as a percent of sales  our print segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our print segment s profit for fiscal year decreased by approximately million  or  from million for the fiscal year  to million for the fiscal year ended february  the decrease in our print profit during fiscal year on a dollar basis as compared to fiscal year is related to the decline in our sales  as previously discussed 
our print segment s profit for fiscal year decreased by approximately million  or  from million for the fiscal year  to million for the fiscal year ended february  the decrease in our print profit during fiscal year on a dollar basis and as a percent of sales as compared to fiscal year is related to the decline in our sales and our gross profit margin  as previously discussed 
apparel segment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and million to goodwill and trademarks  respectively 
excluding the fiscal year impairment charge and certain other unusual charges bankruptcy of customer million and higher than normal inventory reserve charge million associated with our fleece and junior products  the apparel segments profits and percentage of sales were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition to the significant improvement in our gross profits margins as noted earlier  during fiscal year cost cutting in selling  general  and administrative expenses were achieved following a review of our advertising and marketing activities 
apparel profit decreased during fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased sales and gross profit margins  as previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands change working capital cash working capital 
our working capital decreased by approximately million  or from million at february  to million at february  the decrease in our working capital during the period related primarily to the decrease in our inventories on hand 
our current ratio  calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities decreased from to at february  to to at february   due to the cash generated from the reduction in our inventories being used to pay down long term debt 
as a result  our debt to equity ratio decreased from 
to at february  to

table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operations during fiscal increased by million  or over fiscal year  which had increased by million  or over fiscal year during fiscal year  we provided cash primarily through the reduction of our inventories by million  million in the apparel segment alone  and million through the increase in our accounts payable and other associated accrued expenses 
during fiscal year  we collected the build up in receivables associated with our transition away from factoring  improved our receivable turnover ratio  and used less operational cash during the period to build our apparel inventory 
as a result we generated approximately million in cash from these activities 
this was offset by our lower pre impairment operational results  an increase in our prepaid expenses relating to an over payment of taxes  and reduction in our payables  which impacted our operational cash by million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used for our investing activities  which relates primarily to capital expenditures  increased by million  or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase in our capital expenditures relates primarily to our new apparel manufacturing facility located in agua prieta  mexico 
for contractual commitments remaining in connection with the construction of this facility see contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements section following in this report 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used million more in cash associated with our financing activities in fiscal year when compared to the same period last year 
we repaid debt in the amount of million during the fiscal year ended  as compared to million during fiscal year ended we borrowed no additional funds in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year stock repurchase on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a stock repurchase program 
under the board approved repurchase program  share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions  share price  trading volume and other factors  and such purchases  if any will be made in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations 
these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   there were  shares of our common stock that had been purchased under the repurchase program at a cost of million and an average price per share of 
credit facility on august   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america  na the lenders 
the facility provides us access to million in revolving credit  which we may increase to million in certain circumstances  and matures on august  the facility bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from to currently libor or at february   depending on our total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
as of february   we had million of borrowings under the revolving credit line and million outstanding under standby letters of credit arrangements  leaving us availability of approximately million 
the facility contains financial covenants  restrictions on capital expenditures  acquisitions  asset dispositions  and additional debt  as well as other customary covenants  such as total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
we are in compliance with all these covenants as of february  the facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets as well as all capital securities of each domestic subsidiary and of all capital securities of each direct foreign subsidiary 
during fiscal year  we repaid million on the revolver and million on other debt 
it is anticipated that the available line of credit is sufficient to cover  should it be required  working capital required for the foreseeable future 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposures to interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate million revolving credit maturing august  we account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges and record them as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change  unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures  at which time the changes in fair value would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on july   we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement swap for a notional amount of million 
the swap effectively fixes the libor rate at 
the swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  and the fair value at february  was million  million net of deferred taxes 
the swap was reported on the consolidated balance sheet in long term debt with a related deferred charge recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

table of contents pension we are required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we anticipate that we will contribute from million to million during our next fiscal year 
we made contributions of million to our pension plan during each of our last fiscal years 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status  associated liabilities recorded and future required minimum contributions 
at february  we had an unfunded pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million 
inventories we believe our current inventory levels are sufficient to satisfy our customer demands and we anticipate having adequate sources of raw materials to meet future business requirements 
we have long term contracts in effect that govern prices  but do not require minimum volume with paper and yarn suppliers 
certain of our rebate programs do  however  require minimum purchase volumes 
management anticipates meeting the required volumes 
capital expenditures we expect our capital requirements for  exclusive of capital required for possible acquisitions and the development of our new manufacturing facility  will be between million and million 
we would expect to fund these expenditures through existing cash flows 
on june   we announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in the town of agua prieta in the state of sonora  mexico 
we estimate the total capital expenditures of million to million million million for building and million million for machinery and equipment  with funding to be provided by internal cash flow and  as required  our existing credit facilities
