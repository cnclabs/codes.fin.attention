table of contents sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
cbiz typically experiences a net use of cash from operations during the first quarter of its fiscal year  as accounts receivable balances grow in response to the seasonal increase in first quarter revenue generated by the financial services practice group primarily for accounting and tax services 
this net use of cash is followed by strong operating cash flow during the second and third quarters  as a significant amount of revenue generated by the financial services practice group during the first four months of the year are billed and collected in subsequent quarters 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income  noncash increases in depreciation and amortization of million related to acquired businesses and noncash increases in deferred taxes of million 
other sources of cash resulted from an increase in income taxes payable of million over prior year due to the timing of tax payments and an increase in collections on account receivable of million 
these sources are partially offset by uses of cash of million relating to changes in accrued personnel costs resulting from a reduction of incentive compensation expense and a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments 
operating cash flows provided by discontinued operations increased million over the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in approximately million of the increase was attributable to an increase in operating income and approximately million was attributable to a change in the timing of disbursements related to employee health benefits as cbiz converted its employee health benefit plan from a fully insured plan to a self funded program effective january  these increases were partially offset by decreases related to changes in restricted cash  accounts receivable and accrued personnel costs totaling million 
the decrease related to accounts receivable occurred as a result of slower collections  dso increased to days at december  from days at december  investing activities cbiz s investing activities typically result in a net use of cash  and generally consist of payments for business acquisitions and contingent payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses and client lists  purchases of intangible assets and capital equipment  proceeds received from sales of divestitures and discontinued operations  and activity related to notes receivable 
capital expenditures consisted of investments in technology  leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture and equipment 
investing uses of cash during the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of net cash used towards business acquisitions and intangible assets  including two businesses acquired during  and million for net capital expenditures 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of divested and discontinued operations and million in net activity on notes receivable 
investing uses of cash during the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of net cash used towards business acquisitions and intangible assets  including the two businesses acquired on december   and 
table of contents million for net capital expenditures  and were partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of divested and discontinued operations and million in proceeds from the sale of a long term investment 
investing uses of cash during the year ended december  consisted of million of net cash used towards business acquisitions and intangible assets and million for net capital expenditures 
these investing uses of cash were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of divested and discontinued operations and million in proceeds from the sale of a long term investment 
cash flows from investing activities also include investing activities of discontinued operations  which primarily relate to capital expenditures and contingent payments associated with prior acquisitions of a business and client lists 
investing cash flows used in discontinued operations were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
financing activities cbiz s financing cash flows typically consist of net borrowing and payment activity from the credit facility  repurchases of cbiz common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million provided by financing activities for the comparable period in financing uses of cash during the year ended december  included million in net payments on the credit facility  million in cash used to repurchase million shares of cbiz common stock in the current year and settle share repurchase activity from the prior year  offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including the related tax benefits 
financing sources of cash during the year ended december  included million in net borrowings on the credit facility and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including the related tax benefits 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million in cash used to repurchase approximately million shares of cbiz common stock 
financing uses of cash during the year ended december  included million in cash used to repurchase approximately million shares of cbiz common stock  and million in net payments towards notes payable and capitalized leases 
these uses of cash were substantially offset by sources of cash which included million in net proceeds from the credit facility and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including the related tax benefits 
obligations and commitments cbiz s aggregate amount of future obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below in thousands total thereafter convertible notes interest on convertible notes credit facility notes payable contingent purchase price payable capitalized leases restructuring lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations letters of credit in lieu of cash security deposits performance guarantees for non consolidated affiliates license bonds and other letters of credit total convertible notes mature on june   but may be redeemed anytime after june  
table of contents interest on the credit facility is not included as the amount is not determinable due to the revolving nature of the credit facility and the variability of the related interest rate 
excludes cash expected to be received under subleases 
the above table does not reflect million of unrecognized tax benefits  which the company has accrued for uncertain tax positions  as cbiz is unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains administrative service agreements with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business financial services  which qualify as variable interest entities 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the operations or accounts of variable interest entities as the impact is not material to the financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz 
cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an administrative service agreement 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  cbiz provides license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of license bonds outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
cbiz has various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively modify cbiz s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of the floating rate debt under the credit facility  to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding  of which million expired in january and million will expire in january management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
cbiz does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cbiz carries million in convertible senior subordinated notes bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the notes mature on june  and have call protection such that they may not be redeemed until june  cbiz believes the fixed nature of this borrowing mitigates our interest rate risk 

table of contents in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment 
the interest income on these short term investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility are based on market conditions 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to the understanding of cbiz s consolidated financial statements because their application places significant demand on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that estimates may require adjustment if future events develop differently than expected 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract terms are typically contained in a signed agreement with our clients or when applicable  other third parties which generally define the scope of services to be provided  pricing of services  and payment terms generally ranging from invoice date to days after invoice date 
billing may occur prior to  during  or upon completion of the service 
we typically do not have acceptance provisions or right of refund arrangements included in these agreements 
contract terms vary depending on the scope of service provided  the deliverables  and the complexity of the engagement 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below 
financial services revenue primarily consists of fees for services rendered to our clients for accounting services  preparation of tax returns  consulting services  compliance projects  services pursuant to administrative service agreements described under variable interest entities  and valuation services including fairness opinions  business plans  litigation support  purchase price allocations and derivative valuations 
clients are billed for these services based upon a time and expense model  a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows time and expense arrangements revenue is recognized based upon actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus agreed upon out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
fixed fee arrangements revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon progress towards completion  which is determined based upon actual hours incurred on the client project compared to estimated total hours to complete the client project 
contingent revenue arrangements revenue is recognized when savings to the client is determined and collection is reasonably assured 
administrative service agreement revenue revenue for administrative service fees is recognized as services are provided  based upon actual hours incurred 
employee services revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  fee income for administering health and retirement plans and payroll service fees 
revenue also includes investment income related to client payroll funds that are held in cbiz accounts  as is industry practice 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on the service provided  insurance product sold  and billing arrangement  is provided below 

table of contents commissions revenue commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are recognized as of the latter of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer  commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are recognized when the data necessary from the carriers to properly record revenue becomes available  and life insurance commissions are recognized when the policy becomes effective 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions  and reserves for estimated policy cancellations and terminations 
the cancellation and termination reserve is based upon estimates and assumptions using historical cancellation and termination experience and other current factors to project future experience 
cbiz periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
commissions which are based upon certain performance targets are recognized at the earlier of written notification that the target has been achieved  or cash collection 
fee income fee income is recognized in the period in which services are provided  and may be based on predetermined agreed upon fixed fees  actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  or asset based fees 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  as these services are provided to clients continuously throughout the term of the arrangement 
revenue which is based upon actual hours incurred is recognized as services are performed 
revenue for asset based fees is recognized when the data necessary to compute revenue is determinable  which is typically when either market valuation information is available  the data necessary to compute our fees is made available by third party administrators or when cash is received 
cbiz only recognizes revenue when cash is received for those arrangements where the data necessary to compute our fees is not available to the company in a timely manner 
payroll revenue related to payroll processing fees is recognized when the actual payroll processing occurs 
revenue related to investment income earned on payroll funds is based upon actual amounts earned on those funds and is recognized in the period that the income is earned 
medical management professionals revenue is primarily related to fees charged to clients for billing  collection and full practice management services  which are typically charged to clients based upon a percentage of net collections on the company s clients patient accounts or as a fee per transaction processed 
revenue also relates to fees charged to clients for statement mailing services 
the revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows fee income for those arrangements where fees to clients are determined based upon a percentage of net collections  revenue is determinable  earned and recognized when payments are received by our clients on their patient accounts 
for those arrangements where clients are charged a fee for each transaction processed  revenue is typically recognized proportionately over a predetermined service period 
statement mailing services revenues for statement mailing services are recognized when statements are processed and mailed 
national practices the business units that comprise the national practices group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below 
technology consulting revenue consists of services that primarily relate to the installation  maintenance and repair of hardware 
these services are charged to customers based on cost plus an agreed upon markup percentage 
health care consulting clients are billed for health care consulting services based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  time and expense  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue for fixed fee and time and expense arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon actual hours incurred  and revenue that is contingent upon savings is recognized after contingencies have been resolved and verified by a third party 

table of contents mergers acquisitions clients are billed monthly for non refundable retainer fees  or upon the completion of a transaction success fees 
revenue associated with non refundable retainer fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the engagement  as services are performed throughout the term of the contract period of the arrangement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions is recognized when the transaction is completed 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable  including unbilled accounts receivable related to current period service revenue 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectibility of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations 
intangible assets  which include client lists and non compete agreements  are amortized over their expected period of benefit  not to exceed ten years 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment testing may be performed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
cbiz estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing a combination of the discounted cash flow income approach and market comparable market approach methods 
under the income approach  fair value is estimated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate 
the projection of future revenues and expenses inherently includes significant assumptions related to estimated economic trends  expected client behavior and other factors which are beyond management s control 
under the market approach  fair value is estimated by applying the multiples of comparable companies and sales transactions to cbiz s reporting units 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the respective reporting unit s net asset carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  a possible impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exists and further evaluation is performed 
the aggregate fair value of the reporting units is compared to cbiz s market capitalization as of the annual testing date 
in situations where cbiz s market capitalization is significantly different than the estimated fair value for the combined reporting units  management considers the impact of its assumptions as well as the implied control premium to ensure that the fair values of the reporting units are appropriate 
as of the annual testing date in the fourth quarter of  the fair value of cbiz s payroll reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
however  future declines in service revenues or future declines in interest rates  which would reduce interest income earned on the float of clients funds  could reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to an amount less than the carrying value 
this could result in a possible impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill balance  which is million at december  the fair value of cbiz s other reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of that respective reporting unit as of the testing date in the fourth quarter of future decreases in cbiz s stock price  or changes in comparable transaction multiples or other changes in cbiz s business or the market for its services  could reduce the fair value of each reporting unit 
any of these changes could reduce the fair value of the reporting units and 
table of contents could result in impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
there was no goodwill impairment during the years ended december   or loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation is unable to be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to the company s quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
in addition  reserves are established for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
see note and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which adds disclosure requirements about transfers in and out of levels and  for activity relating to level measurements  and clarifies input and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except as it pertains to the requirement to provide the level activity for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
this level requirement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu and will include any required disclosures in its report for the interim period ended march   as appropriate 
in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu 
asu clarifies and improves financial reporting by entities involved with variable interest entities 
asu is effective as of the 
table of contents beginning of the annual period beginning after november  we currently do not expect asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by bank of america  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
cbiz s balance outstanding under its credit facility at december  was million 
if market rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
at december   cbiz had a total notional amount of million related to its interest rate swaps  of which million expired in january and million expire in january management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
in connection with cbiz s payroll business  funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  which included ars prior to the dislocation of this market in early ars are variable debt instruments with longer stated maturities whose interest rates are reset at predetermined short term intervals through a dutch auction system 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment 
since the first quarter of  conditions in the credit markets have resulted in the failure of auctions for the ars that cbiz holds because the amount of securities submitted for sale exceed the amount of bids 
a failed auction does not necessarily represent a default by the issuer of the underlying security 
to date  cbiz has collected all interest on all of its auction rate securities when due and expects to continue to do so in the future 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions resume  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or issuers use a different form of financing to replace these securities 
cbiz understands that issuers and financial markets are working on alternatives that may improve liquidity  although it is not yet clear when or to what extent such efforts will be successful 
while cbiz continues to earn and receive interest on these investments at the contractual rates  the estimated fair value of its investment in ars no longer approximates face value 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding ars and the related asset impairments 
cbiz continues to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact on the fair value of cbiz s investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  cbiz may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges that would be recorded against net income in future periods 
despite the failed auctions with regards to ars  cbiz believes it has adequate liquidity to operate and settle client obligations as the majority of cbiz s client funds are invested in highly liquid short term money market funds and corporate bonds
