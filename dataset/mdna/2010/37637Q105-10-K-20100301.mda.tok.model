item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
highlights and overview on october   the company acquired first national which accounted for an increase in total assets of million  including loans of million  and deposits of million 
cash of thousand and  shares of the company s common stock were issued in the acquisition 
the company also contributed million in capital to the bank 
the acquisition resulted in a million one time bargain purchase gain which was based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
on february   morgan merged into st bank resulting in operations being conducted under the st bank charter 
prior period activity of morgan has been combined and included in st bank s historical results 
the company experienced minimal loan growth with gross loans outstanding increasing by thousand  or less than percent from the prior year 
without the acquisition  loans decreased million  or percent 
investments  including interest bearing deposits and fed funds sold  increased million  or percent  from the prior year as the company continues to deploy loan payments into investment securities  when loan growth slows 
non interest bearing deposits increased million  or percent  during the year 
the company increased interest bearing deposits by million  or percent 
the acquisition of first national contributed million and million of the non interest bearing and interest bearing deposits  respectively  at year end 
fhlb advances increased million during the year  while frb borrowings decreased million 
repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds increased million from the prior year 
stockholders equity increased million  or percent  during the year and the company and each of the bank subsidiaries have remained above the well capitalized levels required by regulators 
although the stockholders equity increase was smaller than the prior year  the company was able to maintain the shareholder dividend while also increasing the alll to percent of loans up from percent at the end of net earnings for were million  which is a decrease of million  or percent  over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share of is a decrease of percent from the earned in the primary reason for the reduction in earnings is the provision for loan losses of million compared to million during the prior year 
included in net earnings for is a million one time bargain purchase gain from the acquisition of first national 
included in net earnings for is a nonrecurring charge of million million pre tax for other than temporary impairment with respect to investments in federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac preferred stock and federal national mortgage association fannie mae common stock and a nonrecurring gain of million million pre tax from the sale and relocation of mountain west s office facility in ketchum  idaho 
net interest income for increased million  or percent  over the prior year 
the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  was percent  an increase of basis points over the percent for the increase in net interest margin is a result of the banks continued focus on low cost deposits and borrowings 
excluding nonrecurring items  the efficiency ratio non interest expense net interest income plus non interest income decreased from percent to percent during  a percentage point improvement 
looking forward  the company s future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions in the markets the company serves  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits  loan quality  and regulatory burden 
the company s goal of its asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
financial condition acquisition the results of operations and financial condition include the acquisition of first company and its subsidiary first national from october  cash of thousand and  shares of the company s common stock were issued in the acquisition 
the company also contributed million in capital to the bank 
the acquisition resulted in a million one time bargain purchase gain recorded in other income 
the bargain purchase gain was based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed and was a result of the net fair value of assets acquired exceeding the purchase price 
adjustment of the allocated purchase price may be related to fair value estimates for which all information has not been obtained on the acquired entity known or discovered during the allocation period  the period of time required to identify and measure the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination 
effective january   fasb asc topic  business combinations  prohibits the carryover of the alll at acquisition date 
fair value of the loan portfolio includes assessment of credit quality  interest rates and other factors 
as a result of no carryover of the alll  many of the traditional credit quality ratios eg  alll as a percent of loans used to monitor trends in credit quality have been skewed at first national  however  at the company level the asset quality ratios are impacted less by such accounting 
subsequent to acquisition  first national maintains an alll for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at period end

additional management s discussion and analysis effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credits and un advanced loan commitments  and lease obligation commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are frb and fhlb advances

represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market and savings 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities  contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days 
however  the banks experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the frb changes short term interest rates 
however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   the company had a negative gap position at six months and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative percent which compares to a negative percent at december  and a negative percent at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on the company s mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity

gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on earnings  after taxes of percent  of a percent increase or decrease in interest rates percent of   gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the net earnings of  a percent increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage decrease on annual net earnings 
this table estimates the repricing and maturities of the contractual characteristics of the assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the categories that reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the individual programs and if the deposits are not clearly rate sensitive  the deposits are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
residential mortgage backed securities are categorized based on the anticipated payments 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the percent policy limit approved by the company s and banks board of directors 
caption dollars in thousands 
del bp estimated sensitivity estimated decrease in net interest income

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
the banks source of funds is generated by deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  sale of loans and securities  short and long term borrowings  and net earnings 
in addition  all of the banks are members of fhlb 
as of december   the banks had billion of available fhlb credit of which million was utilized 
the banks may also borrow funds through the frb and from the us treasury tax and loan program of which the banks have remaining borrowing availability of million and million  respectively 
management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each bank subsidiary as well as the company as a whole 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength continues to be a long term objective 
abundant capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities

dividend payments were per share for and the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
additionally  current guidance from the federal reserve provides  among other things  that dividends per share on the company s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share  measured over the previous four fiscal quarters 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america often requires management to use significant judgments as well as subjective and or complex measurements in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company considers its accounting policy for the alll and determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses accounting policy and analysis the banks charge off policy is consistent with bank regulatory standards 
consumer loans generally are charged off when the loan becomes over days delinquent 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
when such property is acquired  it is recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
any write down at the time of recording real estate owned is charged to the alll 
subsequent write downs  if any  are charged to current expense 
the balance of the alll is an estimate of probable credit losses that have occurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements before losses have been confirmed 
the balance of the alll is highly dependent upon management s internal risk classifications  evaluations of borrowers current and prospective performance  appraisals and other variables affecting the quality of the loan and lease portfolio 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
it is the company s policy to provide an alll for estimated losses on loans and leases based upon past loss experience  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions of certain items  including adverse situations that may affect specific borrowers ability to repay  current collateral values  where appropriate  delinquencies and non performing loans  amount and timing of future cash flows expected on impaired loans  criticized and classified loans  credit concentrations by credit type  industry  geography  recoveries and dispositions of balances previously charge off  volume and terms of loans  loan size and complexity  competition and bank size  local market areas and national economic conditions  effects of changes in lending policies and procedures  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and credit administration staff  and effects of legal and regulatory developments

the alll is increased by charges to earnings and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries

other than temporary impairment on securities accounting policy and analysis the company views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy  as the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company assesses individual securities in its investment securities portfolio for impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its carrying value at the financial statement date 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the amortized cost for the credit loss portion of the impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
management considers whether an investment security is other than temporarily impaired under the guidance promulgated in fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
the company adopted the amendment relating to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments effective for the interim period ending june  and determined there was not a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
for further information regarding the new standards  see discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of recently issued standards 
the company believes that macroeconomic conditions occurring in and have unfavorably impacted the fair value of certain debt securities in its investment portfolio 
for debt securities with limited or inactive markets  the impact of these macroeconomic conditions upon fair value estimates includes higher risk adjusted discount rates and downgrades in credit ratings provided by nationally recognized credit rating agencies  eg  moody s  s p  fitch  and dbrs 
in evaluating equity securities for other than temporary impairment losses  management assesses the company s ability and intent to retain the equity securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 
equity securities owned at december  primarily consisted of stock issued by the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank  such shares measured at cost for fair value purposes in recognition of the transferability restrictions imposed by the issuers 
in addition  the company owns  shares of series o preferred stock issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and  shares of common stock issued by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
the freddie mac and fannie mae stock had a cost basis of at year end due to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge against earnings at september  for the entire amount of the company s investment therein 
hence  none of the equity securities were impaired as of december  in evaluating debt securities for other than temporary impairment  management assesses whether the company intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell impaired debt securities 
in so doing  management considers contractual constraints  liquidity  capital  asset liability management and securities portfolio objectives 
during the first half of  the company sold no investment securities as the company continued its historical approach to managing the investment portfolio  ie  to buy and hold securities to maturity  although such securities may be sold given that all of the securities held in the investment portfolio are designated as available for sale 
such sales were executed with the proceeds used to buy additional investment securities such that the investment portfolio performs well across varying interest rate environments 
during the second half of  the company sold securities of which were tax exempt state and local obligations  of which were each sold at a gross realized loss of  and of which were each sold at a gross realized gain of  a net realized gain of  of the securities sold in the second half of  were residential mortgage backed securities  with such securities sold at a gross realized gain aggregating  of the securities sold at a realized loss  none had previously been subject to an other than temporary impairment charge  and none were subject to an expectation or requirement to sell 
in  the company sold only security at neither gain nor loss for proceeds of  such security was acquired and held for days as collateral to support a borrowing at the u 
s treasury tax and loan program 
sales of securities in occurred with respect to entire investment portfolios of acquired banks following mergers into the company s existing bank subsidiaries 
such sales occurred in recognition that the acquired portfolios of investments were not consistent with the company s investment policy and asset liability management policy 
with respect to its impaired debt securities at december   management determined that it does not intend to sell and that there is no expected requirement to sell any of its impaired debt securities 
for fair value estimates provided by third party vendors  management also considered the models and methodology  for appropriate consideration of both observable and unobservable inputs  including appropriately adjusted discount rates and credit spreads for securities with limited or inactive markets  and whether the quoted prices reflect orderly transactions 
for certain securities  the company obtained independent estimates of inputs  including cash flows  in supplement to third party vendor provided information 
the company also reviewed financial statements of select issuers  with follow up discussions with issuers management for clarification and verification of information relevant to the company s impairment analysis 
as of december   there were investments in an unrealized loss position and were considered to be temporarily impaired and therefore an impairment charge has not been recorded 
all of such temporarily impaired investments are debt securities 
residential mortgage backed securities have the largest unrealized loss 
the fair value of these securities  which have underlying collateral consisting of us government sponsored enterprise guaranteed mortgages and non guaranteed private label whole loan mortgages  were  at december  of which  was purchased during  the remainder of which had a fair market value of  at december  for the securities purchased in there has been an unrealized loss of  since purchase 
of the remaining residential mortgage backed securities in a loss position the unrealized loss increased from percent of fair value at december  to percent of fair value at december  the fair value of collateralized debt obligation securities in an unrealized loss position is  with unrealized losses of  or percent of fair value at december   such investments had an unrealized gain position at december  the fair value of state and local government securities were  at december  of which  was purchased during  the remainder of which had a fair market value of  at december  for the securities purchased in there has been an unrealized loss of  since purchase 
of the remaining state and local government securities in a loss position the unrealized loss decreased from percent of fair value at december  to percent of fair value at december  with respect to the cdo securities  the fair value decline is primarily attributable to a single cdo structure that is a pooled trust preferred security of which the company owns a portion of only the senior notes tranche 
all of the assets underlying such cdo structure are capital securities issued by trust subsidiaries of holding companies of banks and thrifts 
as of december   the senior notes are rated a by moody s and is rated a by fitch  and of the trust subsidiaries have elected to defer the interest on their respective obligations underlying the cdo structure 
as of the end of the prior three quarters of  only of the trust subsidiaries were deferring interest on their respective obligations 
in accordance with the prospectus for the cdo structure  the priority of payments favors holders of the senior notes over holders of the mezzanine notes and income notes 
though the maturity of the cdo structure is june   of the outstanding principle of the senior notes has been prepaid through year end more specifically  at any time the senior notes are outstanding  if either the senior principle or senior interest coverage tests the senior coverage tests are not satisfied as of a calculation date  then funds that would have otherwise been used to make payments on the mezzanine notes or income notes shall instead be applied as principle prepayments on the senior notes 
as of december   the senior principle coverage test was below its threshold level  while the senior interest coverage test exceeded its threshold level 
the senior coverage tests exceeded the threshold levels for each of the prior quarters of and in its assessment of the senior note for potential other than temporary impairment  the company evaluated the underlying issuers and engaged a third party vendor to stress test the performance of the underlying capital securities and related obligors 
such stress testing has been performed as of december  and as of the end of each of the prior four quarters  ie  september  june and march  and december  in each instance of stress testing  the results reflect no credit loss for the senior notes 
in evaluating such results  the company reviewed with the third party vendor the stress test assumptions and concurred with the analyses in concluding that the impairment at december  and prior quarters of was temporary  and not other than temporary 
the company stratified the debt securities for both severity and duration of impairment 
with respect to severity  the following table provides the number of securities and amount of unrealized loss in the various ranges of unrealized loss as a percent of book value 
caption dollars in unrealized number of thousands loss bonds 
del greater than  to  to  to  to to to  total  del 
with respect to the duration of the impaired securities  the company identified securities which have been continuously impaired for the months ending december  the valuation history of such securities in the prior year s was also reviewed to determine the number of months in prior year s in which the identified securities was in an unrealized loss position 
of these securities are non guaranteed  non agency cmos with an aggregate unrealized loss of  the most notable of which had an unrealized loss of  of the securities are state and local tax exempt securities with an unrealized loss of  the most notable of which had an unrealized loss of  of the securities are residential mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  ie  gnma  fnma  fhlmc and sba  the aggregate unrealized loss of which was  included in the debt securities with impairment at december  are non guaranteed  non agency issued cmos tranches 
of the cmos tranches are collateralized by year fixed residential mortgages considered to be prime  and are collateralized by year fixed residential mortgages considered to be alt a 
moreover  none of the underlying mortgage collateral is considered subprime 
for impaired debt securities for which there was no intent or expected requirement to sell  management considers available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that all amounts due would not be collected 
in such assessment  management considers the severity and duration of the impairment  the credit ratings of the security  the overall deal and payment structure  including the company s position within the structure  underlying obligors  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  delinquencies  defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments  cumulative loss projections  discounted cash flows and fair value estimates 
based on the analysis of its impaired securities as of december   the company determined that none of such securities had other than temporary impairment 
goodwill impairment as required by fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter 
the reporting unit level at which goodwill exists is at ten of the eleven bank subsidiaries 
in addition  goodwill and other intangible assets of a subsidiary are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting units below its carrying amount 
examples of events and circumstances that could trigger the need for interim impairment testing include a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding fair value 
in the first step for evaluating for possible impairment  the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value  which includes goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute impairment amount  if any 
as a result of the economic downturn and the decline in the company s stock price during  the company has tested for possible goodwill impairment on a quarterly basis 
for the first step in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment  the company performs two analyses 
the first analysis estimates fair value based on market multiples of deal price to equity  deal price to tangible equity  and deal price to last twelve months earnings 
the deal price multiples are obtained from an independent third party for acquisitions of financial institutions completed within the prior twelve months preceding each testing date  such acquisitions excluding financial institutions whose size and operations are not comparable to the company and its bank subsidiaries 
as an additional analysis  the company also tests for goodwill impairment based on the company s market capitalization adjusted for control value 
in evaluating the range of appropriate control values  the control values have ranged from twenty percent to thirty five percent  such values taking into account recent trends in market capitalization in advance of the date at which the company is testing for potential goodwill impairment 
based on the interim and annual testing results  the company has determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  such that the company s goodwill was not considered impaired during however  further adverse changes in the economic environment  operations of the reporting units  or other factors could result in a decline in the fair value of the reporting units which could result in goodwill impairment

fair value measurements fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires the company to disclose information relating to fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb established a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities in april  fasb issued an amendment to asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  relating to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the company adopted the amendment effective for the interim period ending june  and determined there was not a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
for further information regarding the new standard  see discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of recently issued standards 
on a recurring basis  the company measures investment securities at fair value 
the fair value of such investments is estimated by obtaining quoted market prices for identical assets  where available 
if such prices are not available  fair value is based on independent asset pricing services and models  the inputs of which are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including  but not limited to  yield curves  interest rates  volatilities  prepayments  defaults  cumulative loss projections  and cash flows 
for those securities where greater reliance on unobservable inputs occurs  such securities are classified as level within the hierarchy 
in performing due diligence reviews of the independent asset pricing services and models for investment securities  the company reviewed the vendors inputs for fair value estimates and the recommended assignments of levels within the fair value hierarchy 
the company s review included the extent to which markets for investment securities were determined to have limited or no activity  or was judged to be an active market 
the company reviewed the extent to which observable and unobservable inputs were used as well as the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions about risk that a market participant would use in active markets  with adjustments for limited or inactive markets 
in considering the inputs to the fair value estimates  the company placed less reliance on quotes that were judged to not reflect orderly transactions  or were non binding indications 
the company made independent inquires of other knowledgeable parties in testing the reliability of the inputs  including consideration for illiquidity  credit risk  and cash flow estimates 
in assessing credit risk  the company reviewed payment performance  collateral adequacy  credit rating histories  and issuers financial statements with follow up discussion with issuers 
for those markets determined to be inactive  the valuation techniques used were models for which management verified that discount rates were appropriately adjusted to reflect illiquidity and credit risk 
the company independently obtained cash flow estimates that were stressed at levels that exceeded those used by independent third party pricing vendors 
based on the company s due diligence review  investment securities are placed in the appropriate hierarchy levels with adjustment to vendors recommendations made as necessary 
most notably  the company determined that its collateralized debt obligation securities  ie  trust preferred securities  were illiquid due to inactive markets ie  due to the absence of trade volume during and  the fair values of which had significant reliance on unobservable inputs  and therefore were classified as level within the hierarchy 
on a non recurring basis  the company measures real estate and other assets owned and impaired loans at fair value 
real estate and other assets owned is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
estimated fair value of real estate and other assets owned is based on appraisals 
the company reviews the appraisals  giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral 
the appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell 
real estate and other assets owned are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
allowable methods for estimating fair value of impaired loans include using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans or  where a loan is determined not to be collateral dependent  using the discounted cash flow method 
impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent and the estimated fair value is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral  less estimated cost to sell 
the company reviews the appraisals  giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral 
the appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell 
impaired loans are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in addition to measuring certain financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non recurring basis  the company discloses estimated fair value on financial assets and liabilities 
the following is a description of the methods and inputs used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments recognized at amounts other than fair value 
the fair value for unimpaired loans  net of alll  is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates at which similar notes would be originated for the same remaining maturities 
the market rates used are based on current rates the banks would impose for similar loans and reflect a market participant assumption about risks associated with non performance  illiquidity  and the structure and term of the loans along with local economic and market conditions 
the fair value of term deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates of similar deposits with similar maturities 
the market rates used were obtained from a knowledgeable independent third party and reviewed by the company 
the rates were the average of current rates offered by local competitors of the banks 
the estimated fair value of demand  now  savings  and money market deposits is the book value since rates are regularly adjusted to market rates 
the fair value of the non callable fhlb advances is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates of similar advances with similar maturities 
these rates were obtained from current rates offered by fhlb 
the estimated fair value of callable fhlb advances was obtained from fhlb and the model was reviewed by the company through discussions with fhlb 
the fair value of frb borrowings is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the company for frb borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the current outstanding borrowings are short term and current rates offered by frb equal the rates on the outstanding borrowings  resulting in the estimated fair value being the same as the book value 
the fair value of term repurchase agreements is estimated based on current repurchase rates currently available to the company for repurchases agreements with similar terms and maturities 
the market rates used are based on current rates the banks would incur for similar borrowings 
the estimated fair value for overnight repurchase agreements and other borrowings is book value 
the fair value of the subordinated debentures is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current estimated market rates for subordinated debt issuances with similar characteristics 
the market rates used were based on an independent third party s judgment and include inputs such as implied yield curves and interest rate spreads
