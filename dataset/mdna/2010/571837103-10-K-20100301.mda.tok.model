the goodwill impairment charge in and the difference in the reported preferred dividends due to the timing of the issuance of the senior preferred stock significantly affected the corporation s comparative performance in compared to management believes it is more useful to assess comparative performance in compared to based on an adjusted net loss as shown in the following table years ended december  in millions  except per share data amount diluted eps amount diluted eps reported net loss goodwill impairment senior preferred stock dividend adjusted net loss comparative performance in compared to based on diluted earnings per share is also affected by the number of common shares used to determine earnings per share

in addition  the amount of impairment  
table of contents which affects charge offs and the level of the allowance for loans and leases  remained elevated due to the depressed state of underlying real estate collateral values  particularly construction and development loans 
the decrease in nonperforming loans in the second half of reflects the effects of the corporation s actions taken to reduce the levels of nonperforming loans and the decline in new nonperforming loans 
the amount of new loans and leases that went into nonperforming status during the second half of decreased by approximately million or compared to the first half of in addition  loans delinquent days  excluding credit card loans and student loans  and loans in nonperforming status  decreased by million or  from december  to december  while the direction of these credit quality metrics may be an indication of stabilization in some geographies and markets  management is only cautiously optimistic 
management recognizes the economic recovery remains fragile  unemployment remains elevated and real estate markets remain relatively unstable 
therefore  it may be too early to expect that this recent experience is indicative of the start of a sustainable longer term trend 
the corporation continued to employ a variety of strategies to mitigate and reduce its loan loss exposures such as loan sales and restructuring loan terms to lessen the financial stress and the probability of foreclosure for qualifying customers that have demonstrated the capacity and ability to repay their debt obligations in a manner that serves the best interests of both the customer and the corporation

on an after tax basis that net expense increase over the comparative twelve months was approximately million or per diluted common share 
declining asset yields  competitive deposit pricing in the low interest rate environment  elevated levels of nonperforming loans and the decision to maintain liquidity resulted in lower net interest income in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  equity market volatility along with downward pressure in the equity markets resulted in lower wealth management revenue in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  mortgage loan closings  primarily due to re financings  and increased sales of those loans to the secondary market resulted in mortgage banking revenue growth for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of market conditions  the corporation re acquired and extinguished both bank holding company and banking affiliate long term borrowings at a discount to its carrying value during in addition  during the corporation sold its shares of visa  inc visa class b common stock and certain united states government agency investment securities

these items in total reduced the loss before income taxes by million 
on an after tax basis  these items together with incremental income tax benefits recognized due to a change in state of wisconsin tax law and a favorable federal income tax settlement reduced the net loss for the year ended december  by million or per diluted common share

management expects the prevailing economic and difficult real estate market conditions will last well into in many of the corporation s markets 
nonperforming asset balances are expected to remain elevated 
management believes that the level of new larger construction loans placed on nonperforming status likely have peaked in arizona and florida 
the slow pace of economic recovery and lingering levels of elevated unemployment have resulted in increased stress in consumer loans  particularly residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit 
based on these factors  the amount of new consumer loans that go into nonperforming status is expected to increase 
as a result of these offsetting trends  the levels of new nonperforming loans and leases may continue to stabilize or decrease as they did in the second half of currently  management does not expect that the provision for loan and lease losses and net charge offs reported in is indicative of the provision for loan and lease losses and net charge offs that will be reported in however  the level of net charge offs and the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses are based on management s best estimate of the losses incurred at the measurement date 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
rapidly changing collateral values  general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and continue to increase the possibility that additional losses may be recognized with respect to the corporation s current nonperforming assets 
in addition  an event that would curtail economic recovery or result in further deterioration in the economy and national housing markets would likely result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses reported in future quarters 
due to the uncertainty caused by the state of the economy and real estate markets and the elevated levels of unemployment  and numerous other unknown factors that will ultimately affect the timing and amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses  it is difficult to develop reliable expectations about nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses that will be recognized in with regard to other expectations for  management expects the net interest margin will improve slightly in the near term due to the effects of liquidity redeployment and debt restructuring activities completed in the fourth quarter of however  there are numerous other factors that impact net interest income and the net interest margin 
commercial and industrial loans balances are expected to continue to contract until the economic recovery takes a stronger hold 
commercial real estate loans for are expected to contract slightly 
residential real estate loans are expected to contract because the corporation will likely continue to sell its production in the secondary market 
management expects construction and development real estate loans will continue to decline

the uncertainty that currently exists in the markets makes it difficult to make an estimate of wealth management revenue in compared to for the year ended december   the corporation reported a net loss of  million or per diluted common share compared to income from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million or per diluted common share 

table of contents organic loan growth  disciplined deposit pricing  the ability to access reasonably priced funding sources and banking acquisitions completed in and contributed to the growth in net interest income and other banking sources of revenues

the tier and total regulatory capital ratios were unaffected by this adjustment 
the continued deterioration in the national real estate markets and the economic recession had a negative impact on the corporation s loan and lease portfolio in in addition to a significant increase in nonperforming assets  the amount of loan impairment increased in due to the depressed state of underlying real estate collateral values 
the corporation s construction and development real estate loans  particularly in arizona  the west coast of florida and certain correspondent banking business channels  exhibited the most dramatic increase in stress and impairment 
the increase in stress and impairment and the accelerated disposition of problem assets resulted in net charge offs and provision for loan and lease losses that were significantly higher in when compared to the corporation s historical experience with net charge offs and provision for loan and lease losses

the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the corporation s inability to continue to lower deposit pricing in the low interest rate environment due to competition for deposits contributed to lower net interest income and reduced net interest margin 
the adverse impact of deposit pricing competition was somewhat mitigated by the improved loan to deposit ratio resulting from growth in noninterest bearing deposits

the low interest rate environment and level of nonperforming and renegotiated loans together with the numerous other factors that impact net interest income and the net interest margin have made it very difficult to project the net interest margin with a reasonable degree of certainty 
the net interest income benefit from the reduction in higher cost long term borrowings through modification  re acquisition and maturities throughout will be offset by the lower yields resulting from the sale and reinvestment of investment securities during the favorable shift in the interest bearing deposit mix  increase in noninterest bearing deposits and redeployment of lower yielding short term liquid investments should be beneficial to net interest income

throughout  the corporation made greater use of short term borrowings as well as wholesale funding alternatives  which are deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches

at december   nonperforming assets amounted to  million and increased approximately million or compared to december  nonperforming assets decreased approximately million or since june  the corporation had a significant increase in nonperforming assets in and compared to prior years 
the increase has been primarily attributable to real estate related loans in areas that were previously experiencing substantial population growth and increased demand for housing  principally arizona and florida 
the corporation s higher growth markets have been disproportionately affected by the excess real estate inventory and deterioration in the national real estate markets when the economy deteriorated into recession 
the corporation has worked aggressively to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality and has developed and continues to develop strategies to reduce and mitigate its loss exposure

included in this category is the previously discussed credit relationship with multiple commercial real estate loans related to the lodging industry 
at december  total loans and leases in arizona and florida amounted to billion compared to billion at december   a decline of billion or 
that decline reduces the possibility that the volume of new nonperforming loans and leases associated with those regions will continue at the same pace experienced in and management believes that the level of new larger construction and development loans placed on nonperforming status likely have peaked in arizona and florida 
elevated levels of unemployment have resulted in increased stress in consumer loans  particularly residential real estate loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and residential land loans 
based on these factors  the amount of new consumer loans that go into nonperforming status are expected to increase

the corporation recognizes that the current economy  elevated levels of unemployment and depressed real estate values have resulted in many customers being far more leveraged than prudent and in a very difficult financial position 
potentially distressed homeowners are identified in advance  and proactively offered assistance 
in order to avoid foreclosure in the future  the corporation has restructured loan terms for certain qualified borrowers that have demonstrated the ability to make the restructured payments for a specified period of time 
the corporation s foreclosure abatement program includes several options to reduce contractual payments 
the corporation has primarily used reduced interest rates and extended terms to lower contractual payments 
in addition  the corporation has implemented a day foreclosure moratorium on all owner occupied residential loans for customers who agree to work in good faith to reach a successful repayment agreement

the corporation s instances of default and re default on consumer related renegotiated loans have been relatively low 
for those consumer related renegotiated loans that were restructured between june and december  the cumulative default and re default rate as of december  was approximately 
the corporation attributes this experience to its processes used to determine a reasonable repayment program for qualified borrowers and its policy of requiring such borrowers to demonstrate the ability to make the restructured payments for a specified period of time before the loan is transferred to renegotiated status 
the corporation s experience with renegotiated loan performance is relatively new and does not encompass an extended period of time 
irrespective of the corporation s procedures and policies  payment performance will continue to be adversely affected by unexpected increases in unemployment

in this stressed housing market that has experienced elevated levels of delinquencies and volatile real estate values  the adequacy of collateral securing the loan becomes a much more important factor in determining expected loan performance 
the corporation continuously re assessed  and continues to re assess the timeliness and propriety of appraisals for collateral dependent loans especially in volatile real estate markets such as arizona 
the corporation uses a variety of sources  such as recent sales of loans and sales of oreo  to validate the collateral values used to determine the amount of loss exposure at the measurement date 
in many cases  rapidly declining real estate values have resulted in the determination that the collateral was insufficient to cover the recorded investment in the loan 
these factors resulted in the corporation s loan and lease portfolio experiencing significantly higher incidences of default and a significant increase in loss severity in and as a result of the housing downturn  real estate related loans  especially construction and development real estate loans were the primary contributors to the elevated levels of nonperforming loans and leases and net charge offs in and as previously discussed 
real estate related loans made up the majority of the corporation s nonperforming loans and leases at december  and historically  the corporation s loss experience with real estate loans has been relatively low due to the sufficiency of the underlying real estate collateral 
in a stressed real estate market such as currently exists  the value of the collateral securing the loans has become one of the most important factors in determining the amount of loss incurred and the appropriate amount of allowance for loan and lease losses to record at the measurement date 
the likelihood of losses that are equal to the entire recorded investment for a real estate loan is remote 
however  in many cases  rapidly declining and depressed real estate values have resulted in the determination that the estimated value of the collateral was insufficient to cover all of the recorded investment in the loan which has required significant additional charge offs 
depressed collateral values have significantly contributed to the elevated levels of net charge offs and the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses that the corporation experienced over the past two years 
the amount of cumulative net charge offs recorded on the corporation s nonperforming loans outstanding at december  was approximately million or of the unpaid principal balance of the affected nonperforming loans and of the unpaid principal balance of its total nonperforming loans outstanding at december  these charge offs have reduced the carrying value of these nonperforming loans and leases which reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses required at the measurement date

the provision for loan and lease losses is the amount required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  compared to at december  and at december  while the direction of nonperforming and potential nonperforming loans and leases may be an indication of stabilization in some geographies and markets  management is only cautiously optimistic 
management recognizes the economic recovery remains fragile  unemployment remains elevated and real estate markets remain relatively unstable 
therefore  it may be too early to expect that this recent experience is indicative of the start of a sustainable longer term trend 
management expects the prevailing economic and difficult real estate market conditions will last well into in many of the corporation s markets 
nonperforming asset balances are expected to remain elevated 
management believes that the level of new larger construction loans placed on nonperforming status likely have peaked especially in arizona and florida 
the slow pace of economic recovery and lingering levels of elevated unemployment have resulted in increased stress in consumer loans  particularly residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit 
based on these factors  the amount of new consumer loans that go into nonperforming status is expected to increase 
as a result of these offsetting trends  total new nonperforming loans and leases may continue to stabilize or decrease as they did in the second half of 
table of contents currently  management does not expect that the provision for loan and lease losses and net charge offs reported in is indicative of the provision for loan and lease losses and net charge offs that will be reported in however  the level of net charge offs and the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses are based on management s best estimate of the losses incurred at the measurement date 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
rapidly changing collateral values  general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and continue to increase the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized with respect to the corporation s current nonperforming assets 
in addition  an event that would curtail economic recovery or result in further deterioration in the economy and national housing markets would likely result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses reported in future quarters 
due to the uncertainty caused by the state of the economy and real estate markets  the elevated levels of unemployment  and numerous other unknown factors that will ultimately affect the timing and amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses  it is difficult to develop reliable expectations about nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses that will be recognized in the corporation will continue to proactively manage its problem loans and nonperforming assets and be aggressive to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality 
the corporation will continue to employ strategies  such as selective sales of nonperforming loans and restructuring loans to qualified borrowers  to mitigate its loss exposure 
construction and development loans tend to be more complex and may take more time to attain a satisfactory resolution 
depending on the facts and circumstances  acquiring real estate collateral in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans may continue to be the best course of action to take in order to mitigate the corporation s exposure to loss

as a result of the unprecedented weakness in the financial markets and the decline in the corporation s common stock price  numerous tests for goodwill impairment were performed throughout the results of goodwill impairment testing at the end of the fourth quarter of indicated that the fair value of certain of the corporation s reporting units were less than their book values  resulting in a non cash charge to pre tax earnings for goodwill impairment in the amount of  million 
tier and total regulatory capital ratios were unaffected by this adjustment 
the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification  adopts an aggregate view of goodwill and bases the accounting for goodwill on the units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated and is referred to as reporting units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined by the segment reporting topic of the codification  or one level below an operating segment 
the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification provides guidance for impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized 
other than goodwill  the corporation does not have any other intangible assets that are not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
the corporation has elected to perform its annual test for goodwill impairment as of june th 
based on the test performed at the end of the fourth quarter of  the wealth management segment  which consists of the trust  private banking and brokerage reporting units  and the capital markets reporting unit did not have indicators of potential impairment based on the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
based on their estimated fair values  the commercial and community banking segments and the national consumer banking reporting unit had indicators of potential impairment and were subjected to the second step of 
table of contents goodwill impairment testing 
the deterioration in the national real estate markets  the economic recession and the disruption in the capital markets had the greatest adverse affect on these segments and reporting units 
as a result of applying the second step of the test  the national consumer banking reporting unit had no goodwill impairment  the commercial banking segment recorded goodwill impairment of million and the community banking segment recorded goodwill impairment of million

increased provisions for losses associated with unfunded loan commitments and other credit related liabilities accounted for million of the increase in other noninterest expense in compared to historically  the corporation s loss exposure with respect to these items has been relatively low 
the credit evaluation of the customer  collateral requirements and the ability to access collateral is generally similar to that for loans

approximately  million of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes 
as a result of the internal revenue service s irs decision not to appeal a november us tax court ruling related to how the tefra interest expense disallowance should be calculated within a consolidated group and the position the irs has taken in another related case  the corporation recognized an additional income tax benefit related to years of million for its similar issue during the effective tax rate in reflects  in part  the effect of the increase in tax exempt income  primarily life insurance revenue  as previously discussed and increased tax benefits from programs and activities that are eligible for federal income tax credits 
some of these programs and activities provide annual tax benefits in the form of federal income tax credits in future periods as long as the programs and activities continue to qualify under the federal tax regulations

under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  except as described below  the corporation may not redeem the senior preferred stock during the first three years that it is outstanding 
after the first three years  the corporation may redeem shares of the senior preferred stock for the per share liquidation preference of  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
the corporation is permitted  subject to regulatory approval  to redeem in whole or in part the senior preferred stock during the first three years only if a it has received aggregate gross proceeds of not less than million from one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the securities purchase agreement  and b the aggregate redemption price of the senior preferred stock redeemed does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds received by the corporation from any such qualified equity offerings 
the corporation received a total of  million in aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offerings in  which met the requirements for qualified equity offerings 
any repurchase of the senior preferred stock would be contingent upon the determination of the board of directors that such repurchase is in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders 
furthermore  any repurchase of the senior preferred stock would be subject to consultation with and approval by the corporation s banking regulators 
to the extent the corporation seeks such approval  there can be no assurance that such approval will be granted 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra  which was signed into law in february  cpp participants are permitted to redeem the preferred stock issued under the cpp at any time  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency 
however  the corporation s restated articles of incorporation contain the redemption restrictions described above 
the corporation may seek board of directors and shareholder approval in the future to amend the restated articles of incorporation to allow the corporation to redeem the senior preferred stock at any time after consultation with the federal reserve board 
as long as any senior preferred stock is outstanding  the corporation may pay quarterly common stock cash dividends of up to per share  and may redeem or repurchase its common stock  provided that all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the senior preferred stock are fully paid 
prior to the third anniversary of the ust s purchase of the senior preferred stock  unless senior preferred stock has been redeemed or the ust has transferred all of the senior preferred stock to third parties  the consent of the ust will be required for the corporation to increase its common stock dividend to more than per share per quarter or repurchase its common stock or other equity or capital securities  other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the securities purchase agreement 
as previously described  the corporation recently reduced its quarterly common stock cash dividend to per share 
the senior preferred stock will be non voting except for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the senior preferred stock 
as a condition to participating in the cpp  the corporation issued and sold to the ust a warrant the warrant to purchase  shares the warrant shares of the corporation s common stock  at an initial per share exercise price of  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the term of the warrant is ten years 
the warrant will not be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer  provided that the ust may only transfer a portion or portions of the warrant with respect to  or exercise the warrant for  more than one half of the initial warrant shares prior to the earlier of a the date on which the corporation has received aggregate gross proceeds of at least  million from one or more qualified equity offerings  b december  if the corporation completes one or more qualified equity offerings on or prior to december  that result in the corporation receiving aggregate gross proceeds equal to at least  million  then the number of warrant shares will be reduced to of the original number of warrant shares 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the corporation s common stock  
table of contents and upon certain issuances of the corporation s common stock at or below a specified price range relative to the initial exercise price 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  the ust has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  until the ust no longer owns any shares of the senior preferred stock  the warrant or warrant shares  the corporation s employee benefit plans and other executive compensation arrangements for its senior executive officers must continue to comply in all respects with section b the eesa and the rules and regulations of the ust promulgated thereunder 
the securities purchase agreement permits the ust to unilaterally amend any provision of the letter agreement and the securities purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with any changes in the applicable federal statutes 
for accounting purposes  the proceeds of  million were allocated between the preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values 
the initial value of the warrant  which is classified as equity  was million 
the entire discount on the senior preferred stock  created from the initial value assigned to the warrant  will be accreted over a five year period in a manner that produces a level preferred stock dividend yield which is 
at the end of the fifth year  the carrying amount of the senior preferred stock will equal its liquidation value 
preferred dividends accrued and discount accretion on the senior preferred stock amounted to million for the year ended december  preferred dividends paid on the senior preferred stock amounted to million for the year ended december  the corporation had a stock repurchase program under which up to million shares of the corporation s common stock can be repurchased annually 
as a result of the restrictions contained in the securities purchase agreement  the corporation allowed the stock repurchase program to expire and did not reconfirm the stock purchase program for during the first quarter  the corporation acquired  shares of its common stock in open market share repurchase transactions under the stock repurchase program 
total cash consideration amounted to million 
at december   the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to million which represents a positive change in accumulated other comprehensive income of million since december  net accumulated other comprehensive income associated with available for sale investment securities was a net loss of million at december   compared to a net loss of million at december   resulting in a net gain of million over the twelve month period 
the unrealized loss associated with the change in fair value of the corporation s derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges decreased million since december   resulting in a net increase in shareholders equity 
the accumulated other comprehensive income which represents the amount required to adjust the corporation s postretirement health benefit liability to its funded status amounted to an unrealized gain of million as of december  federal and state banking laws place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends and loans which a bank may make to its parent company 
such restrictions have not had  and are not expected to have  any material effect on the corporation s ability to meet its cash obligations 
at december   the corporation s tier regulatory capital ratio was or billion in excess of well capitalized under the federal reserve board s regulatory framework 
to be well capitalized under the regulatory framework  the tier capital ratio must meet or exceed 
the corporation s tier regulatory capital ratio at december  includes the impact of the two underwritten public offerings of its common stock completed in  plus the at the market offerings as previously discussed 
the corporation manages its liquidity to ensure that funds are available to each of its banks to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to ensure the corporation s own cash requirements are met 
the corporation maintains liquidity by obtaining funds from several sources 

table of contents average other short term investments amounted to billion during compared to billion in  an increase of billion 
at the present time  other short term investments represent the corporation s most readily available source of liquidity 
this source of liquidity reflects management s decision to maintain higher levels of liquid assets 
another readily available source of liquidity to the corporation is its investment portfolio 
investment securities available for sale  which totaled billion at december   represent a highly accessible source of liquidity 
the corporation s portfolio of held to maturity investment securities  which totaled billion at december   provides liquidity from maturities and interest payments 
depositors within m i s defined markets are another source of liquidity 
core deposits demand  savings  money market and consumer time deposits averaged billion in the corporation s banking affiliates may also access the federal funds markets  the federal reserve s term auction facility or utilize collateralized borrowings such as treasury demand notes  fhlb advances  agricultural mortgage backed notes or other forms of collateralized borrowings 
the corporation s banking affiliates may use wholesale deposits  which include foreign eurodollar deposits 
wholesale deposits  which averaged billion in  are deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches 
average brokered and institutional certificates of deposit represented of total average wholesale deposits in the weighted average remaining term of outstanding brokered and institutional certificates of deposit at december  was years 
these deposits allow the corporation s banking subsidiaries to gather funds across a national geographic base and at pricing levels considered attractive  where the underlying depositor may be retail or institutional 
access to wholesale deposits also provides the corporation with the flexibility not to pursue single service time deposit relationships in markets that have experienced some unprofitable pricing levels 
the corporation and or m i bank may repurchase or redeem its outstanding debt securities from time to time  including  without limitation  senior and subordinated global bank notes  medium term corporate notes  minotes or junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and the related trust preferred securities 
such repurchases or redemptions may be made in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise for cash or other consideration 
any such repurchases or redemptions will be made on an opportunistic basis as market conditions permit and are dependent on the corporation s liquidity needs  compliance with any contractual or indenture restrictions and regulatory requirements and other factors the corporation deems relevant 
during  the corporation re acquired and extinguished  million of debt 
the debt consisted of various bank notes issued by the corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  m i bank 
the market impact of the recession and deterioration in the national real estate markets has resulted in a decline in market confidence and a subsequent strain on liquidity in the financial services sector 
however  the sales of common stock issued in financing transactions during and participation in the cpp in provided the corporation with billion in cash and significantly increased its regulatory and tangible capital levels 
management expects that it will continue to make use of a wide variety of funding sources  including those that have not shown the levels of stress demonstrated in some of the national capital markets 
notwithstanding the current national capital market impact on the cost and availability of liquidity  management believes that it has adequate liquidity to ensure that funds are available to the corporation and each of its banks to satisfy their cash flow requirements 
however  if capital markets deteriorate more than management currently expects  the corporation could experience stress on its liquidity position 
m i bank has implemented a global bank note program that permits it to issue up and sell up to a maximum of us billion aggregate principal amount or the equivalent thereof in other currencies at any one time outstanding of its senior global bank notes with maturities of seven days or more from their respective date of issue and subordinated global bank notes with maturities more than five years from their respective date of issue 
the notes may be fixed rate or floating rate and the exact terms will be specified in the applicable pricing supplement or the applicable program supplement 
this program is intended to enhance liquidity by enabling m i bank to sell its debt instruments in global markets in the future without the delays that would otherwise be incurred 
at december   approximately billion of new debt could be issued under m i bank s global bank note program 

table of contents total bank notes outstanding at december  amounted to billion of which billion is subordinated 
a portion of the subordinated bank notes qualifies as supplementary capital for regulatory capital purposes 
during the second quarter of  the corporation filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission enabling the corporation to issue up to million shares of its common stock  which may be offered and issued from time to time in connection with acquisitions by the corporation and or other consolidated subsidiaries of the corporation 
at december   approximately million shares of the corporation s common stock could be issued under the shelf registration statement for future acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation field a shelf registration statement pursuant to which the corporation may issue corporate debt and or equity securities with a relatively short lead time  subject to market conditions  and which may be used to register resales of securities acquired by shareholders in transactions exempt from registration under federal securities laws 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s more significant contractual obligations at december  excluded from the following table are a number of obligations to be settled in cash 
these items are reflected in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet and include deposits with no stated maturity  trade payables  accrued interest payable and derivative payables that do not require physical delivery of the underlying instrument

as such  interest charges on certificate of deposit and other time deposit obligations and short term debt obligations were excluded from amounts reported  as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest bearing assets 
the same  although to a lesser extent  is the case with respect to interest charges on long term debt obligations 
as long term debt obligations may be used for purposes other than to fund interest bearing assets  an estimate of interest charges is included in the amounts reported 
as of december   the corporation has unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized  would impact the annual effective tax rate in future periods 
due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments  all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the contractual 
table of contents obligations table

certain retail certificates of deposit and other time deposits give customers rights to early withdrawal 
early withdrawals may be subject to penalties 
the penalty amount depends on the remaining time to maturity at the time of early withdrawal 
brokered certificates of deposits may be redeemed early upon the death or adjudication of incompetence of the holder 
many short term borrowings such as federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements and commercial paper are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not necessarily represent an immediate need for cash 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s short term borrowings 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s various long term borrowings 
the amounts shown in the table include interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon rates in effect at december  the contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates 
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s foreign exchange activities 
the corporation generally matches commitments to deliver foreign currencies with obligations to purchase foreign currencies which minimizes the immediate need for cash 
the corporation also has unfunded obligations for certain investments in investment funds 
under the obligations for certain investments in investment funds the corporation could be required to invest an additional million if the investment funds identify and commit to invest in additional qualifying investments 
the investment funds have limited lives and defined periods for investing in new qualifying investments or providing additional funds to existing investments 
as a result  the timing and amount of the funding requirements for these obligations are uncertain and could expire with no additional funding requirements 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s defined contribution program 
the amount shown represents the unfunded contribution for the year ended december  the health and welfare benefit plans are periodically funded throughout each plan year with participant contributions and the corporation s portion of benefits expected to be paid 
the corporation has generally financed its growth through the retention of earnings and the issuance of debt 
it is expected that future growth can be financed through internal earnings retention  additional debt offerings  or the issuance of additional common or preferred stock or other capital instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement describes the means through which companies typically structure off balance sheet transactions or otherwise incur risks of loss that are not fully transparent to investors or other users of financial information 
for example  in many cases  in order to facilitate the transfer of assets or otherwise finance the activities of an unconsolidated entity  a company may be required to provide financial support designed to reduce the risks to the entity or other third parties 
that financial support may take many different forms such as financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to continuing risks or contingent liabilities regardless of whether or not they are recorded on the balance sheet 
certain guarantees may be a source of potential risk to future liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
guarantees may be in the form of contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument or variable such as a financial standby letter of credit or credit support agreement  failure to perform under an obligating agreement such as a performance standby letter of credit  and indemnification agreements that require the indemnifying party to make payments to the indemnified party based on changes in an underlying instrument or variable that is related to an asset  a liability or an equity security of 
table of contents the indemnified party  such as an adverse judgment in a lawsuit 
the corporation  for a fee  regularly enters into standby letters of credit transactions and provides certain indemnifications against loss in conjunction with securities lending activities  which are described in detail in note fair value measurements and note guarantees in notes to consolidated financial statements 
companies may structure and facilitate off balance sheet arrangements by retaining an interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity 
such interests may be in the form of a subordinated retained interest in a pool of receivables transferred to an unconsolidated entity  cash collateral accounts  recourse obligations or other forms of credit  liquidity  or market risk support 
these subordinated interests protect the senior interests in the unconsolidated entity in the event a portion of the underlying transferred assets becomes uncollectible or there are insufficient funds to repay senior interest obligations 
in the past the corporation has used such arrangements primarily in conjunction with its indirect automobile lending activities 
as described in note financial asset sales in notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation discontinued  on a recurring basis  the sale and securtization of automobile loans into the secondary market 
as a result of clean up calls and other events  the corporation acquired the remaining loans from the auto securitization trusts during and at december  the corporation was not involved in any such arrangements 
as described in note long term borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation holds all of the common interests in certain trusts that issued cumulative preferred capital securities which are supported by junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and a full guarantee issued by the corporation 
in conjunction with the banking acquisitions of gold banc  trustcorp financial  inc  excel bank corporation and first indiana  the corporation acquired all of the common interests in trusts that issued cumulative preferred capital securities which are supported by junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
m i has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities that these trusts have issued 
at december   the principal amounts outstanding associated with the remaining trusts amounted to million  million  million and million 
the corporation does not consolidate any of these trusts in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
on january   the corporation adopted the new accounting standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities which were known as sfas and sfas prior to becoming part of the codification 
sfas and sfas made fundamental changes to the accounting for transfers of financial interests and consolidation of variable interest entities 
the impact of adopting these new accounting standards was not material 
at december   the corporation did not hold any material variable interests in entities that provide it liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the corporation 
based on the off balance sheet arrangements with which it is presently involved  the corporation does not believe that such off balance sheet arrangements either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact to its current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital 

table of contents critical accounting policies the corporation has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the corporation are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein and updated as necessary in its quarterly reports on form q 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of the operations of the corporation 
management continues to consider the following to be those accounting policies that require significant judgments and assumptions allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors 
some factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative judgment 
management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine that it is adequate to absorb these inherent losses 
this evaluation is supported by a methodology that identifies estimated losses based on assessments of individual problem loans  historical loss patterns of homogeneous loan pools and adjustments to reflect current economic conditions 
the inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative to the performance of the loan portfolio and numerous other factors create degrees of imprecision in these measurements 
management considers the effect of imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses 
in addition  environmental factors  including economic conditions and regulatory guidance  unique to each measurement date are also considered 
the corporation s reserving methodology has the following components  which are collectively reported as the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the entire allowance for loan and lease losses is available to absorb losses from loans and leases in any of the components 
specific reserve 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
nonaccrual loans  which the corporation refers to as nonperforming loans  and troubled debt restructurings  which the corporation refers to as renegotiated loans  meet the definition of an impaired loan 
for impaired loans  impairment is measured using one of three alternatives the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  if available  or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell for collateral dependent loans and loans for which foreclosure is deemed to be probable 
in general  these loans have been internally identified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
this analysis considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and also other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
all nonperforming loans greater than million and all renegotiated loans were evaluated to identify the specific reserve or valuation allowance to be allocated to each of these loans 
the specific reserve or valuation allowance is determined as the excess  if any  of the carrying value of the loan over the amount determined using the measurement alternative employed at the measurement date 
the carrying value of the loan reflects reductions from prior charge offs 
for renegotiated loans the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate was the methodology predominantly employed to measure the amount of impairment at december  contractual cash flows were adjusted for probability of default  expected prepayments  expected collateral value for loans that will not be fully amortized at maturity and other factors that may impact the timing and amount of expected cash flows 
factors used to adjust contractual cash flows were based on historical experience and market performance statistics where available 
at december  the specific reserve or valuation allowance for renegotiated loans was determined to be million 

table of contents for nonperforming loans greater than million the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell was the methodology predominantly employed to measure the amount of impairment at december  real estate related loans  especially construction and development real estate loans  were the primary contributors to the elevated levels of nonperforming loans and leases and net charge offs in and real estate related loans made up the majority of the corporation s nonperforming loans and leases at december  and historically  the corporation s loss experience with real estate loans has been relatively low due to the sufficiency of the underlying real estate collateral 
in a stressed real estate market such as currently exists  the value of the collateral securing the loans has become one of the most important factors in determining the amount of loss incurred and the appropriate amount of allowance for loan and lease losses to record at the measurement date 
the likelihood of losses that are equal to the entire recorded investment for a real estate loan is remote 
however  in many cases  rapidly declining and depressed real estate values have resulted in the determination that the estimated value of the collateral was insufficient to cover all of the recorded investment in the loan which has required significant additional charge offs 
depressed and declining collateral values have significantly contributed to the elevated levels of net charge offs and the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses that the corporation experienced over the past two years 
the corporation continuously re assessed  and continues to re assess the timeliness and propriety of appraisals for collateral dependent loans especially in volatile real estate markets such as arizona 
the corporation uses a variety of sources  such as recent sales of loans and sales of oreo  to validate the collateral values used to determine the amount of loss exposure at the measurement date 
at december  the specific reserve or valuation allowance for nonperforming loans greater than million was determined to be million 
at december  a total of  million of impaired loans and leases were evaluated to identify the specific reserve or valuation allowance to be allocated to each of these loans 
a total valuation allowance of million was determined to be required on approximately  million of impaired loans and no valuation allowance was determined to be required on million of impaired loans 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance at december   the corporation has taken into consideration that the amount of cumulative net charge offs recorded on the corporation s nonperforming loans outstanding at december  was approximately million or of the unpaid principal balance of the affected nonperforming loans 
these charge offs have reduced the carrying value of these nonperforming loans and leases which reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses required at the measurement date 
collective loan impairment 
this component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two elements 
first  the corporation makes a significant number of loans and leases  which due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are loans and leases from the retail sector and commercial loans and leases that were excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
for purposes of this discussion  the term commercial loans refers to variety of loan types and includes commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial construction and development loans and commercial leases 
commercial loans are initially segmented by loan type 
the loan types are then stratified by region or business channel 
using the corporation s internal risk ratings  commercial loans and leases are further stratified between loans and leases with risk ratings that are indicators of a nonperforming loan or lease or potential problem loan or lease  which the corporation refers to as criticized loans and leases  and loans and leases that indicate no particular weakness 
using historical loss information  an estimate of loss is determined for each segment 
for criticized loans and leases  more recent historical loss information forms the basis to determine the estimates of losses inherent in the pools at the measurement date 
for all other loans and leases  longer term historical loss information is used to form the basis to determine the estimates of losses inherent in the pools at the measurement date 
longer term historical loss information is expected to be representative of inherent losses over an entire business cycle 
historical loss information is updated quarterly to reflect current experience 
historical loss information may be adjusted for portfolio trends  the effect of loan sales and factors that may be unique to a particular loan or lease type  region or business channel to ensure the loss rates ultimately used are appropriate at the measurement date 
selecting the appropriate loss rates that are used to determine the estimates of losses inherent in the pools at the measurement date requires significant judgment 
at december   this component of the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million 

table of contents the retail sector consists of residential real estate loans  residential construction and development loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  personal loans and personal leases 
retail sector loan types are stratified based on origination channels  underwriting guidelines  collateral type and product features such as a loan or line of credit and delinquency status 
the loans are further stratified by selected markets arizona  wisconsin  florida and others  updated credit scores and the loan s year of origination 
loss factors are derived from historical loss experience by delinquency status for each stratum and applied to the outstanding loan and lease balance by delinquency status to determine a reserve 
based on current market conditions  the corporation estimates additional probable loss by evaluating probability of default and loss severity  the factors that collectively impact the amount of loss inherent in the retail sector loans and leases 
current factors impacting the probability of default such as lingering levels of elevated unemployment may not be fully reflected in updated credit scores or in existing levels of delinquency  causing historical default experience to be understated at the measurement date 
rapidly changing real estate collateral values arising from illiquid markets  excess inventories in certain markets and high current loan to value ratios resulting from property value depreciation since the date the loans were originated impact historical loss severity 
this additional probable loss is added to the amounts determined based on historical experience 
at december   this component of the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million 
the second element reflects management s recognition of the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating losses 
from time to time  the corporation has identified certain loans within certain industry segments that based on financial  payment or collateral performance  warrant closer ongoing monitoring by management 
the specific loans mentioned earlier are excluded from this analysis 
based on management s judgment  reserve ranges may be allocated to industry segments due to environmental conditions unique to the measurement period 
consideration is given to both internal and external environmental factors such as economic conditions in certain geographic or industry segments of the portfolio  economic trends  risk profile  and portfolio composition 
reserve ranges are then allocated using estimates of loss exposure that management has identified based on these economic trends or conditions 
at december   there was no allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to industry segments due to environmental conditions unique to the measurement period 
the corporation has not materially changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
however  on an on going basis the corporation continues to refine the methods used in determining management s best estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
based on the loss estimates discussed  management determined its best estimate of the required allowance for loans and leases 
management s evaluation of the factors previously described resulted in an allowance for loan and lease losses of  million or of loans and leases outstanding at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses was  million or of loans and leases outstanding at december  consistent with the credit quality trends noted above  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to  million in  compared to  million in and million in the resulting provisions for loan and lease losses are the amounts required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts currently due or owed  and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 

table of contents the federal and state taxing authorities periodically review the corporation s interpretation of federal and state income tax laws and make assessments based on their determination of tax laws 
tax liabilities could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities based on the completion of taxing authority examinations 
the corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when  despite its belief that its tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  the corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged 
in evaluating a tax position  the corporation determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the corporation s estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences  and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable 
during  the corporation recognized an income tax benefit of million that resulted from the favorable resolution of a tax matter associated with a stock issuance 
in addition  during  the state of wisconsin passed legislation that requires combined reporting for state income tax purposes effective january  as a result  the corporation recorded an additional income tax benefit in of million to recognize certain state deferred tax assets  which included the reduction of a valuation allowance for wisconsin net operating losses 
the corporation expects that income tax expense will increase in future periods due to the enacted legislation 
as a result of the internal revenue service s decision not to appeal a november us tax court ruling related to how the tefra interest expense disallowance should be calculated within a consolidated group and the position the irs has taken in another related case  the corporation recognized an additional income tax benefit related to years of million for its similar issue in at december   the corporation reported a net deferred tax asset of billion 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is required is based on available positive and negative evidence 
based on its analysis of the evidence  the corporation determined that no valuation allowance was required to be recorded against the federal deferred tax assets at december  the corporation is in a year cumulative loss position as of december  this is considered as a significant piece of negative evidence 
the positive evidence for the corporation is that it forecasts sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period  exclusive of tax planning strategies  even under stressed scenarios 
the realization of the deferred tax assets can be subjective and could be significantly reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are significantly lower than currently forecasted 
the corporation currently does not have any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within months of december  fair value measurements the corporation measures fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the topic also addresses the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
these valuation techniques include the market approach  income approach and cost approach 
the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions that are identical to or comparable with assets or liabilities being valued 
the income approach involves converting future amounts based on current market expectations about those future amounts to a single present amount 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset 
the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification  establishes a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy 
table of contents gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the reported fair value of a financial instrument is categorized within the fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument s fair value measurement 
the three levels within the fair value hierarchy consist of the following level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models  quoted prices of financial assets or liabilities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
fair values are initially valued based upon a transaction price and are adjusted to reflect exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties 
a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy is disclosed in note fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  fair values are used in purchase price allocations and goodwill impairment testing 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion regarding the corporation s annual test for goodwill impairment 
measurements other than level involve various valuation techniques and models  which seek to maximize inputs that are observable  when available 
selecting the relevant inputs  appropriate valuation techniques and the appropriate category to report the fair value of a financial instrument requires varying levels of judgment depending on the facts and circumstances 
the determination of some fair values can be a complex analysis of many factors 
judgment is required when determining the fair value of an asset or liability when either relevant observable inputs do not exist or available observable inputs are in a market that is not active 
when relevant observable inputs are not available  the corporation must use its own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates 
conversely  in some cases observable inputs may require significant adjustments 
for example  in cases where the volume and level of trading activity in an asset or liability have declined significantly  the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants  or the prices are not current  the observable inputs might not be relevant and could require significant adjustment 
valuation techniques and models used to measure the fair value of financial assets on a recurring basis are reviewed and validated by the corporation at least quarterly and in some cases monthly 
in addition  the corporation monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing service information  using exception reports based on analytical criteria  comparisons to previous trades or broker quotes and overall reviews and assessments for reasonableness 
goodwill impairment tests goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment as defined by the segment reporting topic of the codification 
this first step is a screen for potential impairment 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of june th or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill has been assigned to six reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
the judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment and the application of these estimates and assumptions are discussed below 

table of contents the estimated fair value for the commercial banking segment  community banking segment  private banking reporting unit and trust reporting unit at june  was determined by equally weighting an income approach and market approach to assess if potential goodwill impairment existed 
for the capital markets reporting unit  national consumer banking reporting unit and the brokerage reporting unit the estimated fair value at june  was determined by weighting to an income approach 
the corporation determined that there was not sufficient comparable metrics associated with guideline companies and those reporting units to place any reliance on the market approach 
the income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit 
the key assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach included the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
the discount rate represents the estimated cost of equity  was derived using a capital asset pricing model that uses a risk free rate year treasury bonds which was at june  the risk free rate was adjusted for the risks associated with the operations of the reporting units 
the discount rates used in the income approach for the six reporting units evaluated at june  ranged from to 
an increase to the discount rate of would have lowered the fair value determined under the income approach for the six reporting units evaluated at june  by a range of million to million or to 
the market approach is a technique that provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies in the same or similar lines of businesses 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating to the public companies stock prices equity as of june  were applied to each reporting unit as previously discussed to determine indications of its fair value 
the aggregate fair values were compared to the corporation s market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements 
the corporation used the average stock price for the month of june the comparison between the aggregate fair values and market capitalization indicated an implied premium 
a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within a range of the overall premiums observed in the market place 
as a result of applying the first step of goodwill impairment testing to determine if potential goodwill impairment existed at june   trust  private banking  and brokerage  the three reporting units that comprise the wealth management segment  and the capital markets reporting unit passed fair value exceeded the carrying amount the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the commercial banking segment and the national consumer banking reporting unit failed the carrying amount exceeded the fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test at june  and were subjected to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
for the four reporting units that passed step one  fair value exceeded the carrying amount by to of their respected estimated fair values 
for the two reporting units that failed  the carrying amount exceeded fair value by between and 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the fair value allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets also requires significant judgment  especially for those assets and liabilities that are not measured on a recurring basis such as certain types of loans 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the corporation believes the implied fair value of goodwill is significantly affected by unobservable inputs and would be categorized as level within the fair value hierarchy 
the corporation completed the second step of the process in order to determine if there is any goodwill impairment for the two reporting units that failed step one of the goodwill impairment tests 
in addition  the corporation performed the second step of the process for one reporting unit that marginally passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

table of contents the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill will generally increase if the fair value of its loans and leases are less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s loans and leases 
the fair value of loans and leases was derived from discounted cash flow analysis as described in note fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the stress and deterioration in the national real estate markets  liquidity stress and current economic conditions have depressed prices buyers and sellers are paying and receiving for bank related assets  especially loans and leases 
the corporation s allocation of the fair values to the assets and liabilities assigned to the individual reporting units was less than their reported carrying values 
as a result  the corporation was not required to recognize any goodwill impairment upon completion of the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
there have been no events since the annual test to indicate that it is more likely than not that the recorded goodwill had become impaired 
due to the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the corporation s reporting units  there can be no assurances that the corporation s estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the economic recession  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of the corporation s annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if the corporation s assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved  the corporation may be required to record additional goodwill impairment losses in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material
