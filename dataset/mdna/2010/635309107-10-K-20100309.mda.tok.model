table of contents theatres added to our network in the second half of and  on which there is generally a ramping up period associated with new affiliate additions as those new screens are integrated into client proposals 
the increase in payments from the founding members related to their beverage concessionaire agreements was due to the fact that payments did not begin until the ipo date offset by a reduction in contracted beverage advertising time from seconds to seconds by one of our founding members during local advertising revenue increased million or to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in total average screens in our advertising network  including amc loews 
local revenue per theatre attendee remained consistent for the full year of compared to combined pre and post ipo periods at per attendee  despite the addition of network affiliate theatre screens and over  amc loews screens to which we did not have full inventory access until december due to certain run out provisions 
total advertising contract value per attendee for the year ended january  was per attendee  which represents a decrease of compared to pre and post ipo periods 
the slight decrease in the advertising contract value per attendee was primarily due to the impact of integrating new network affiliate and amc loews screens into our sales process 
there is generally a three month lag time once the theatres have been connected to our network before they are fully integrated into our sales process 
fathom events revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to the combined pre and post ipo periods as a result of a increase in the number of events and due to the success of several fathom events

table of contents selling and marketing costs 
selling and marketing costs increased to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods  or an increase of 
selling and marketing costs have increased primarily due to an expansion in the local sales force and an increase in local sales commissions associated with increased sales and higher direct marketing costs associated with the increase in the number of fathom business and consumer events 
there was also an increase in the provision for bad debt reflecting the broader local client base and higher local revenue 
administrative and other costs 
administrative and other costs for the year ended january  was million compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods  an increase of primarily due to increased professional fees and personnel costs associated with being a public company and additional personnel associated with the growth in our network and higher activity in our fathom events divisions 
depreciation and amortization

the increase in net interest expense is primarily due to a million non cash charge to interest expense related to the change in the status of our interest rate swap that is not accounted for as a cash flow hedge due to the bankruptcy of lehman as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  partially offset by lower market interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt 
the million non operating impairment charge related to our investment in a start up advertising company as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the decrease in income taxes is due to lower pre tax income  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate caused primarily by a valuation allowance we recorded against the deferred tax asset related to the non operating impairment charge 
the decrease in the amount attributable to noncontrolling interest is primarily due to the lower amount of income allocable to the noncontrolling interest  caused by the items discussed above offset by additional common membership units issued in and by distributions to noncontrolling interest in excess of proportionate share of earnings of million recorded for the year ended january  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
known trends and uncertainties the current challenging macro economic environment  especially in the local marketplace  and late breaking national television scatter advertising market in general  present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients and collections of accounts receivable 
however  we are cautiously optimistic that the impact to our business will be mitigated due to factors including the growth in our advertising client base  the effectiveness of cinema advertising relative to other mediums  and the impact of our broader national network and the related increase in salable impressions 
as noted previously  in we added several new affiliate theatres to our national network including american cinemas galaxy theatres  llc  la live theatres  storyteller theatres corporation  starplex cinemas and showbiz cinemas 
these additions have added nearly million new attendees on a full year pro forma basis  representing in excess of million new salable advertising impressions 
our sales force either has or will integrate these additional impressions into the advertising sales process during and we expect that the yield on these attendees to be positive in we believe that the continued growth of our network will continue to strengthen our selling proposition in comparison to other national advertising platforms 

table of contents under the esas  up to seconds of the firstlook program can be sold to our founding members to satisfy their on screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements 
during  we sold seconds to our founding members 
we expect to continue to sell seconds of time to the founding members in and sell the other seconds to other advertising clients 
on january   amc announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with kerasotes in which amc will acquire substantially all of the assets of kerasotes 
pursuant to the amended esas and common unit adjustment agreement  the kerasotes theatres will be subject to the amc esa and at the time kerasotes theatres are added to our network  amc would be entitled to receive ncm llc common units in accordance with the common unit adjustment agreement and theatre access fees in accordance with the esa 
the addition of kerasotes to amc does not increase our screen count or attendance as it represents a movement from a network affiliate agreement to the esa structure 
after the common unit adjustment  we expect our affiliate expense to be reduced  partially offset by increases in the theatre access fee and beverage revenue and as a result our adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda margins should increase 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december   january  and the post ipo period was  and  respectively 
during fiscal our effective tax rate included the effect of a valuation allowance 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items and the relative amount of income that ncm  inc earns in various state and local jurisdictions  which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
refer to note for additional details on our effective tax rate 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to the balance of million as of january  ncm llc has an aggregate revolving credit facility commitment of million with a consortium of banks 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc lehman filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
ncm llc s revolving credit facility includes million with lehman commercial paper inc lcpi  a subsidiary of lehman 
as of december   ncm llc has borrowed million from lcpi under the revolving credit facility 
lcpi failed to fund its undrawn commitment of million 
on february   lcpi assigned the million commitment to barclays bank barclays 
in addition  ncm llc has been working with lcpi and its other lenders with the goal of having lcpi s agency function transferred to another bank within ncm llc s lender group and restructuring lcpi s outstanding million revolving loan such that i it would not be required to be repaid  nor would it share in any pro rata prepayments of the revolving loans  until the final maturity date of the revolving credit facility and ii it would not be available for reborrowing in the event that it was prepaid 
until these lcpi issues are resolved  however  ncm llc is not anticipating repaying any of its revolver borrowings as it would effectively result in a permanent reduction of its revolving credit facility  to the extent of the payments against lcpi borrowings 
the increase in our liquidity position from january  was due to cash flow generated from operating activities exceeding the cash used in investing and financing activities  as follows in millions year ended dec 
 year ended jan 
 post ipo period ended dec 
 pre ipo period ended feb 
 operating cash flow investing cash flow financing cash flow 
table of contents operating activities 
the increase in funds provided by operating activities for the year ended december  versus the period was primarily due to higher revenue levels and changes in the timing of the collection of accounts receivable balances and the timing of payments for normal operating expenditures 
investing activities 
the increase in cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  versus the period was primarily due to a decrease in the sale of short term investments off set by lower levels of capital expenditures 
the period included amounts for the purchase of equipment and related installation for certain network affiliate theatres 
financing activities 
the increase in cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  versus the period was primarily due to lower net proceeds from borrowings and higher available cash distributions to our founding members related to higher levels of available cash as defined in the operating agreement 
our cash balances will fluctuate due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments  as well as available cash payments as defined to ncm llc s founding members  interest payments on our term loan  income tax payments  tax sharing payments to our founding members and quarterly dividends to ncm  inc s common shareholders pursuant to our dividend policy 
sources of capital and capital requirements 
ncm  inc s primary source of liquidity and capital resources are distributions from ncm llc 
ncm llc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are generated by its operating activities and cash on hand 
management believes that cash on hand and future funds generated from ncm llc s operations should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  ncm llc s debt service requirements  and capital expenditures and other investing requirements  through the next months 
cash flows generated by ncm llc s distributions to ncm  inc and the founding members can be impacted by the seasonality experienced in advertising revenues at ncm llc 
ncm llc is required pursuant to terms of the operating agreement effective as of february  to distribute its available cash  as defined in the operating agreement  to its members the founding members and ncm  inc 
the available cash distribution to the members of ncm llc for the year ended december  was million  of which million was ncm  inc s portion 
ncm  inc will use cash received from the available cash distributions to fund income taxes  payments associated with the tax sharing agreement with the founding members and current and future dividends as declared by the board of directors  including a dividend declared in january of per share approximately million which will be paid on april  distributions from ncm llc and ncm  inc cash balances should be sufficient to fund ncm  inc s tax sharing payments to the founding member circuits  income taxes and its regular dividend 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of ncm llc have typically been related to equipment required for our noc and content production and post production facilities  digital content system and back office capitalized software upgrades developed primarily by our programmers  office leasehold improvements  desktop equipment for use by our employees  and in certain cases  the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate s theatres when they are added to our network 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million including million associated with network affiliate additions compared to million including million associated with network affiliate additions for the period 
the capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations 
all capital expenditures related to the dcn within ncm llc s founding members theatres have been made by the founding members under the esas 
we expect they will continue to be made by the founding members in accordance with the esas 
we expect to make approximately million to million of capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for upgrades to our digital content system  distribution software and our internal management systems  including our advertising inventory optimization  management and reporting systems  our internet site and 
table of contents network equipment related to newly built network affiliate theatres 
we expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems  which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients  should enhance our operating efficiencies  including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory  and prepare us for continued growth 
our capital expenditures may be increased should we decide to add any additional network affiliates to our network 
we expect that additional expenditures  if any  would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates 
the commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in contractual and other obligations below 
we also expect depreciation and amortization to increase over due to the addition of the future common unit adjustment intangible assets 
financings senior secured credit facility 
on february   concurrently with the closing of the ipo of ncm inc  ncm llc entered into a senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders 
the facility consists of a six year million revolving credit facility and an eight year  million term loan facility 
the net proceeds of the term loan were used  together with million of proceeds from the offering  to redeem all the preferred membership units of ncm llc for an aggregate price of million 
the term loan will be due on the eighth anniversary of the funding 
the revolving credit facility portion is available  subject to certain conditions  for general corporate purposes of the company in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the credit agreement  and a portion is available for letters of credit 
the obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of ncm llc 
the outstanding balance of the term loan facility at december  was million 
the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at december  was million 
as of december   the effective rate on the term loan was including the effect of the interest rate swaps both those accounted for as hedges and those not 
the interest rate swaps hedged million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of while the unhedged portion was at an interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on the unhedged revolver was 
commencing with the fourth fiscal quarter in fiscal year  the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility will be determined quarterly and will be subject to adjustment based upon a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio for ncm llc and its subsidiaries the ratio of secured funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  over a non gaap measure defined in the credit agreement which is equivalent to adjusted oibda 
the senior secured credit facility also contains a number of covenants and financial ratio requirements  with which the company was in compliance at december   including the amount of debt that is required to be hedged 
the debt covenants require of the term loan  or million to be hedged at a fixed rate 
as of december   the company had approximately hedged 
of the million that is hedged  million was with lehman brothers special financing lbsf  a subsidiary of lehman 
on february  ncm llc entered into a novation agreement with lbsf and barclays pursuant to which barclays took on all the obligations of lbsf with regard to these hedging arrangements  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the company expects to remain in compliance with its covenants and financial ratio requirements as set forth in its credit facility for based on its budgets 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of ncm llc are described in note of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of ncm llc 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  and the determination of fair value of options for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 
we utilize the black scholes option price model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options the expected life of the options is determined by using the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options the simplified method as described in sec staff accounting bulletin 
due to the short length of time over which our options have been outstanding  the company has not developed a historical option exercise experience and has determined that the simplified method is a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we estimate expected volatility based on comparable companies and industry indexes for historic stock price volatility 
until such time as we have sufficient historical information to derive an implied volatility we expect to continue to use this method as long as we believe such companies are comparable to us 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic income taxes formerly sfas no 
 as clarified by fin no 
 which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under currently enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently have a million valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such assets in future periods 
in addition  due to the basis differences resulting from our ipo date transactions and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement  and entry into the tax receivable agreement with our founding members  we are required to make cash payments to the founding members in amounts equal to of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above 
the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  as amended  are highly technical and complex and involve management s judgment  including judgments to determine hypothetical taxing outcomes exclusive of the ipo date transaction and agreements 
if we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to our founding members 

table of contents in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we are subject to examination by tax authorities for years beginning with recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our business operations  see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document

off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease obligations  which primarily include office leases  are not reflected on our balance sheet

table of contents the value in this table represents the maximum potential payout 
no amounts have ever been paid under these agreements and no liabilities are recorded as of december  for additional details see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the tax receivable agreement entered into at the completion of our ipo provides for the payment by us to the founding members of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
the payments to the founding members are based  in part  on actual annual income and as such  will vary based on our operating results 
the value in the table represents the estimated amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as of december  the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each founding member 
the amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies while the amount relating to the screens factor will be more predictable but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and other screens are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of the founding members 
the payments made to founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 
seasonality the levels of revenue  operating income  consolidated net income  oibda and adjusted oibda are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to the quarter s film revenue and related attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry 
advertising expenditures tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to new product releases and marketing cycles and higher theatre attendance 
theatrical attendance is generally highest during the summer and year end holiday season coinciding with the release of blockbuster films 
as a result  we typically have less revenue  operating income  consolidated net income  oibda and adjusted oibda and our operating margins are lower in the first quarter than the other quarters of a given year 
given this variability  the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next or any future quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect interest costs relating to the variable portion of our senior secured debt facility  which is not covered under the hedging agreement 
we have entered into a fixed interest rate swap arrangements that hedge million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   there was an aggregate of million of variable rate debt outstanding on the term portion of our facility that was not covered by interest rate swaps  and million of variable rate debt outstanding on the revolver portion of our facility 
a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense by approximately million for an annual period  net of the effect of interest rate swaps 
because each of our interest rate swaps was in a liability position at december   we are not currently exposed to counterparty risk related to the swaps
