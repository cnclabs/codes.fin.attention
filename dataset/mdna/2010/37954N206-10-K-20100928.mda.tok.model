introduction globe specialty metals  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  we  our  or gsm is one of the leading manufacturers of silicon metal and silicon based alloys 
as of june   we owned and operated six principal manufacturing facilities  in three primary operating segments gmi  our us operations  globe metais  our brazilian operations  the manufacturing component of which was sold on november   and  globe metales  our argentine operations 
business segments we operate in six reportable segments gmi a manufacturer of silicon metal and silicon based alloys located in the united states with plants in beverly  ohio  alloy  west virginia  niagara falls  new york  selma  alabama and bridgeport  alabama  globe metais a distributor of silicon metal manufactured in brazil 
this segment includes the historical brazilian manufacturing operations  previously comprised of a manufacturing plant in breu branco and mining operations and forest reserves  which were all sold on november   globe metales a manufacturer of silicon based alloys located in argentina with a silicon based alloys plant in mendoza and a cored wire fabrication facility in san luis  solsil a developer and manufacturer of upgraded metallurgical grade silicon metal located in the united states with operations in beverly  ohio  corporate a corporate office including general expenses  investments  and related investment income  and other includes an electrode production operation in china and a cored wire production facility located in poland 
these operations do not fit into the above reportable segments  and are immaterial for purposes of separate disclosure 
overview and recent developments our business has improved to near pre recession levels with volumes shipped in fiscal year increasing more than from the prior year  with approximately one third of the increase in volume coming from the acquisition of core metals 
we are presently running all of our furnaces in our six primary plants at full capacity  subject to planned maintenance outages 
our primary end markets  which include chemicals  steel  aluminum and solar have all recovered significantly from the recession with chemicals and solar in particular driving the increasing market demand for silicon metal 
chemical producers  who manufacture silicones using silicon metal as a raw material  continue to announce increased volume and capacity utilization amid strong end user demand 
steel industry capacity utilization in the us  which is a major drive r of our silicon based alloy business  has risen significantly from recessionary levels  reaching in june and  with some vacillations  has remained relatively stable at that level 
over half of our silicon based alloy production is sold to steel mills as additives 
aluminum demand has also risen from recessionary levels as domestic auto production begins to recover 
silicon metal is used in all aluminum products  but the highest concentration is in automotive uses 
polysilicon output and solar cell demand is continuing its rapid growth with new production capacity coming on line 
polysilicon  which requires silicon metal as its key raw material  is used in the production of photovoltaic solar cells 
during the quarter ended december   in response to growing customer demand  we reopened our niagara falls  new york plant and began the process of reopening our selma  alabama plant  which gave us a total capacity of approximately  mt of silicon metal excluding dow corning s portion of the capacity of our alloy plant  subject to planned maintenance outages 
selma  which had been idled only nine months  ramped up roughly as expected  incurring approximately  of start up related costs in the fiscal year ended june  niagara falls  which had been down more than six years  encountered numerous start up issues  including employee hiring and training  engineering and facilities maintenance and  as a result  has taken longer than expected to stabilize production operations 
as of june   due to these start up issues  the plant was producing less than anticipated output at higher than expected costs 
as a result  for the fiscal year ended june   we incurred approximately  of start up related costs 
to remedy the situation  in july and august  we brought each of the two furnaces down for maintenance  in succession for approximately three weeks each  to correct the maintenance and engineering issues 
in addition  we continued to enhance hiring  training and supervision of the plant staff 
as a result  we anticipate incurring additional start up related costs in the quarter ending september  as of mid september  both furnaces were running at expected capacity 
the acquisition of core metals  which closed on april   provided us with approximately  mt of additional annual ferrosilicon a silicon based alloy production capacity from its bridgeport  alabama plant 
the plant ran at full capacity for the quarter ended june   other than for planned maintenance outages  as ferrosilicon demand and pricing remained stable 
overall  the core metals acquisition should lower our average selling price of silicon based alloys  since ferrosilicon is sold on a silicon contained basis  but it is expected to add meaningfully to our gross margin 
on april   we sold masterloy products company masterloy  an ancillary business included in the core metals acquisition  for  net sales for the quarter ended june  increased approximately  or  from the previous quarter ended march   primarily as a result of the acquisition of core metals and a increase in silicon metal volume shipped 
our average selling price of silicon metal increased  or excluding the material shipped to dow corning under the joint venture agreement  versus the previous quarter primarily as a result of an increase in the percentage of material shipped under annual contracts and spot pricing 
the average selling price of silicon based alloys decreased in the quarter ended june  from the previous quarter ended march  primarily from the change in sales mix from the core metals acquisition  which increased our sales of ferrosilicon  our lowest priced alloy  which also has our lowest cost of production 
excluding the mix change  silicon based alloy selling prices remained similar to the previous quarter 
silicon metal tons shipped increased from the previous quarter  based on higher production levels  and silicon based alloy shipments increased primarily from the acquisition of core metals  but also from an increase in shipments of other silicon based alloys 
outlook customer demand continues to increase for our silicon metal and silicon based alloys as customers continue to experience end market growth 
this increasing demand has tightened the silicon metal market  leading to increased spot pricing 
we anticipate continuing to operate all of our furnaces at our six primary plants at full capacity utilization in the coming quarters  subject to planned maintenance outages 
spot pricing for silicon metal  according to metal bulletin  has risen from approximately lb at the beginning of calendar to approximately lb in september we expect our average selling price to increase modestly in the quarter ending september  as we sell limited volumes at current spot prices  however  we expect our total volume of shipments to decline somewhat in the quarter ending september  as we experience certain planned maintenance outages 
we expect net sales in the quarter ending september  to decrease modestly from the quarter ended june  as a result of lower shipments  caused by decreased production from planned maintenance outages  partially offset by higher average selling prices 
the most significant scheduled outages in the quarter are at our niagara falls  new york plant and we expect will serve to partially remedy the engineering and maintenance issues that have caused the decreased production output and higher operating costs in previous quarters 
this may cause a modest decline in earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year and will lead to additional start up related expenses 
at the beginning of calendar  after the below market  mt contract with dow corning expires and our calendar annual contracts expire  we expect a significant increase in our silicon metal average selling price  which would directly improve earnings 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used under different assumptions or conditions 
business combinations we have completed a number of significant business acquisitions 
our business strategy contemplates that we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the residual of the excess of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we generally en gage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and may impact reported depreciation and amortization in future periods  as well as any related impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets 
goodwill at june   we had goodwill totaling  we annually review  in the third quarter of our fiscal year  goodwill for impairment 
a review is also performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit 
fair value is measured based on a di scounted cash flow method  using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model  or a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
the estimates of cash flows  future earnings  and discount rate are subject to change due to the economic environment and business trends  including such factors as raw material and product pricing  interest rates  expected market returns and volatility of markets served  as well as our future manufacturing capabilities  government regulation and technological change 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
long lived assets at june   we had property  plant  and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  totaling  including  associated with our solsil business unit 
solsil is currently focused on research and development projects and is not producing material for commercial sale 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future undiscounted pretax cash flows of the related operations 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
assets to be disposed are written down to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values  and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estima tes  circumstances or conditions  including the results of solsil s research and development activities  could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
inventories at june   we had inventories totaling  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  which does not exceed net realizable value 
cost of inventories is determined either by the first in  first out method or by the average cost method 
when circumstances indicate a potential valuation issue  tests are performed to assess net realizable value  and as necessary  an inventory write down is recorded for obsolete  slow moving or defective inventory 
we estimate market and net realizable value based on current and future selling prices for our inventories  as well as the expected utilization of parts and supplies in our manufacturing process 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in estimates or future price decreases caused by changing economic conditions  including customer demand  could result in future inventory adjustments  resulting in decreased operating profits and lower asset levels 
share based compensation during the year ended june   we recorded share based compensation expense of  share based payments to the extent they are compensatory are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
we have applied the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in our accounting for share based compensation 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
given our share based compensation was granted under a new plan and that there is relatively no historical data  we have estimated a forfeiture rate of zero 
actual forfeitures in the future may differ from this estimate  which would favorably impact our future results from operations 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market effective july  
accordingly  for stock awards granted subsequent to july   we value our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
prior to july   our common stock was traded on the aim market of the london stock exchange  and we valued our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the aim market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
the fair value of an award is affected by our closing stock price as well as other assumptions  including the estimated volatility over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  which is calculated using the simplified method allowed by sab as there is limited trading data related to our common stock  the expected volatility over the expected vesting term of our share based compensation is based upon the historical volatilities of similar companies 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the award 
our expected dividend rate for grants prior to june  was zero as we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate doing so 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact our results from operations 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  during the year ended june  as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce deferred tax assets if  and to the extent that  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is base d on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset and liability reversals 
we believe that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based  in part  on an estimate of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  as well as the estimated timing of the reversal of temporary differences  which give rise to our deferred income tax assets  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates in future periods  and depending on the tax strategies that we may be able to implement  changes to the valuation allowance could impact our financial position and results of operations 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense 
prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification subtopic  business com binations  on july   such adjustments were recorded to a reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition  b reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition  and c reduce income tax expense 
we recognize an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  based on the technical merits of the position 
the income tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority 
the determination of an uncertain tax position and the likelihood of it being realized requires critical judgment and estimates 
we carefully assess each of the uncertain tax positions in order to determine the tax benefit that can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we record and or disclose such potential tax liabilities  as appropriate  and reasonably estimate our income tax liabilities and recovera ble tax assets 
if new information becomes available  adjustments will be charged against income at that time 
we do not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by our recent acquisitions and divestitures 
we acquired core metals in april  solsil in february and yonvey in may accordingly  our results for the years ended june  and include the results of solsil and yonvey for the entire period and core metals for three months in fiscal year results for the year ended june  include the results of solsil for four months and yonvey for one and a half months 
we sold the manufacturing operations of globe metais in november  but continue to sell a portion of the silicon metal produced by globe metais to fulfill commitments to customers of globe metais that we retained

the increase in metric tons sold resulted in an increase in net sales of  and was related to an increase in silicon metal and a increase in silicon based alloy metric tons sold 
silicon metal volume sold was higher due to the reopening of our niagara falls  new york facility in november  which provided approximately an additional  metric tons  offset by a decrease in production volumes in selma  alabama of approximately  metric tons due to plant closure from april to january the increase in silicon based alloy volume includes the impact of the core metals acquisition  which contributed approximately  metric tons of ferrosilicon in fiscal year additionally  end market demand for magnesium ferrosilicon increased in the second half of fiscal year due to the economic recovery  particularly in automotive production 
the decline in average selling price resulted in decreased net sales of approximately  and was a result of an decrease in the average selling price of silicon based alloys and a decrease in the average selling price of silicon metal 
the decline in silicon based alloy pricing was due to a significant reduction in steel production in the first half of fiscal year  driven by lower automobile production and construction spending 
this resulted in an overall reduction in customer demand  which caused us to reduce pricing to retain volume and also caused a mix shift towards the production of ferrosilicon  which is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production 
additionally  the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year caused a further mix shift within silicon based alloys to ferrosilicon 
the decrease in silicon metal pricing was primarily due to the impact of shipping of the alloy joint venture output at cost to dow corning  offset by favorable annual contracts and higher spot pricing in the quarter ended june  silica fume and other revenue increased by  as a result of  of other sales from core metals in fiscal year  offset by a decline of  in yonvey s electrode sales to third parties  and lower production levels and sales of other by products 
cost of goods sold the  or  increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in metric tons sold  offset by a decline in cost per ton sold 
this decline in cost per ton sold was the result of several factors  including the curtailment of solsil production  which lowered cost of goods sold by  and metric tons sold by approximately  a mix shift within silicon based alloys to lower cost ferrosilicon  which reduced cost of goods sold by approximately  and our overall cost reduction programs 
these cost decreases were partially offset by lower capacity utilization during fiscal year and start up costs totaling approximately  primarily at our niagara falls and selma plants 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and decreased to approximately of net sales in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the start up costs for our niagara falls and selma plants  the impact of selling of the alloy joint venture output at cost to dow corning  and the lower silicon based alloy average selling price 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or  was largely due to the write off of  of deferred offering costs in the second quarter of fiscal year  caused by a more than day delay in our initial public offering  a decrease of  and  in audit and other professional fees at corporate and yonvey  respectively  a decrease of  of wages  insurance and general expense at yonvey through aggressive cost cutting measures  a decrease of  primarily in salaries and wages at solsil due to the suspension of commercial production  and a decrease of approximately  at globe metais  of which  was due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  and the balance was due to aggressive cost reduction measures 
these decre ases were offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of  at gmi with the restart of the niagara falls plant  higher due diligence costs of  and the impact of the acquisition of core metals  which increased expense by research and development the decrease in research and development expenses of  was primarily due to the suspension of production and related activities at solsil  which resulted in a decrease of  gain on sale of business gain on sale of business recorded in fiscal year is associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  for gross cash proceeds of approximately  less transaction expenses and the recording of certain retained liabilities 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment goodwill and intangible asset impairment recorded in fiscal year was approximately  and was associated with the solsil business unit 
the global economic slowdown  combined with a decrease in oil prices  caused a sharp decline in the product price and demand for upgraded metallurgical grade silicon 
as a result  it was determined that the value of the solsil business unit no longer supported its goodwill and intangible asset balances 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased by  due to the refinancing and repayment of credit facilities at gmi  yonvey  and globe metales  which resulted in lower average debt balances and interest rates  and the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  other income other income decreased by  due primarily to a one time gain at gmi of  due to the settlement of litigation in fiscal year  a year over year decrease of  of other income related to royalties associated with the lease of certain property at gmi  and a year over year decrease of  of dividend income to globe metales from hydroelectric plant ownership interests  offset by a year over year foreign exchange gain of  driven primarily by fluctuations of the brazilian real against the us dollar prior to our sale of globe metais manufacturing operations 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal years and was and  respectively 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in each jurisdiction 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
the change in our tax provision was primarily due to the fact that the prior year goodwill impairment charge arose from a non taxable acquisition and no tax benefit was obtained from the goodwill impairment 
in addition  the change in the level of earnings and losses within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate also impacted the effective tax rate 
the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the benefit associated with the recording of certain state tax credits and adjustments in fiscal year segment operations gmi years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges operating income net sales increased  or  from the prior year to  the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in metric tons sold

additionally  the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year caused a further mix shift to ferrosilicon 
the gmi segment includes the alloy joint venture  which was entered into on november   and sells of the output of the alloy plant to dow corning at cost 
we control the joint venture and consolidate its results in our financial statements 
as a result of the joint venture  gmi s gross margin has been reduced by virtue of the material sold to dow corning at cost 
operating income decreased by  from the prior year to  this was primarily due to increased production costs and lower average selling prices for silicon based alloys 
cost of goods sold increased by while volumes increased by only 
this caused an increase in the cost per ton sold  which reflects our reduced capacity utilization  and start up costs of approximately  at our niagara falls and selma plants 
the addition of core metals contributed  to selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  and the reopening of the niagara falls plant was a major driver of the  increase in salaries and benefits at gmi

after the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  globe metais no longer produces or sells by products 
operating income decreased by  or  from the prior year to  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations  which led to lower sales volumes 
results also included transaction costs associated with the sale of  cost of goods sold decreased while volumes decreased  which caused an increase in the cost per metric ton sold 
this increase was due to lower capacity utilization and increased production costs associated with the appreciation of the brazilian real  which was offset by gains on our foreign exchange forward contract  which are recorded in other income 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november   which resulted in a cost reduction of approximately  and the balance was due to aggressive cost reduction measures

cost of goods sold the decrease in the cost of goods sold of  represented a year over year decrease in costs which is significantly less than the or  metric tons decrease in year over year volumes 
the disproportionate decrease in costs was due to the impact of the yonvey and solsil acquisitions  lower factory capacity utilization  increased power costs  and increased electrode costs 
the acquisition of solsil in february  contributed incremental cost of goods sold of approximately  the cost of goods sold at yonvey and solsil for fiscal year includes inventory write downs of  power costs increased due to a new rate structure at globe metais which started on july  power costs at globe metais were  higher than they would have been if power rates remained constant 
at gmi power rates were higher due to fixed demand charges being allocated over lower volume and power tariff increases at all gmi production facilities 
power costs at gmi were  higher than they would have been if power costs remained constant 
we idled certain furnaces at all of our facilities in the second half of fiscal year  resulting in a significant reduction in the absorption of fixed costs 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and remained comparable in fiscal year as a result of higher average selling prices offset by higher power costs  inventory write downs  and lower capacity utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to the timing of the solsil and yonvey acquisitions in fiscal year  which contributed increases of  and  respectively   of deferring offering costs written off because our initial public offering was postponed by more than days  executive bonuses and bonus accruals at corporate which increased by approximately  including a special  one time discretionary bonus of  paid to our executive chairman  and  an increase of  in salaries and benefits related to increased infrastructure in advance our initial public offering 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of share based compensation expense of  research and development the increase in research and development expenses of  was primarily due to the acquisition of solsil in february  which contributed an incremental  of expenses  partially offset by a decrease of  at globe metais as certain projects that were underway in the prior year were completed

provision for income taxes income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were approximately or  in fiscal year and or  in fiscal year  respectively 
the change in our tax provision was primarily due to the fact that the one time goodwill impairment charge arose from a non taxable acquisition and no tax benefit was obtained from the goodwill impairment 
in addition  the change in the level of earnings and losses within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate also impacted the effective tax rate 
we currently operate under a tax holiday in argentina and operated under a tax holiday in brazil prior to the sale of globe metais 
in brazil  we operated under a tax holiday  which resulted in a preferential tax rate of of our manufacturing income as compared to a statutory rate of

silicon metal volumes were down due to a decline in demand from our silicone and aluminum customers 
silicon based alloy volumes were down only due to a reduction in our magnesium ferrosilicon volumes  offset by increases in ferrosilicon products 
pricing for silicon metal was up  due to an increase in spot pricing moderated by our long term fixed price contracts  while pricing for silicon based alloys was up 
operating income increased by  from the prior year to  this was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price offset by volume declines  increased production costs and increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of goods sold decreased while volumes decreased 
this increase in cost per ton sold was due to increased power costs  higher electrode prices and reduced capacity utilization 
power rates were higher due to fixed demand charges being allocated over lower volume and power tariff increases at all gmi production facilities 
power costs at gmi were  higher than they would have been if power cost per ton sold remained constant from to salaries and benefits for employees involved in selling  general and administrative activities increased by approximate ly  at gmi  due to increased headcount and increased pension expenses as a result of plan asset losses

cost of goods sold increased  from the prior year to  partially due to the timing of the acquisition of solsil in february cost of goods sold in was approximately  in excess of net sales  reflecting solsil s efforts to refine its production process 
cost of goods sold also included an inventory write down of  solsil recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment in fiscal year of  the global economic slowdown  combined with the decrease in oil prices  caused a sharp decline in product price and demand for upgraded metallurgical grade silicon 
as a result  it was determined that the value of the solsil business unit no longer supported its goodwill and intangible asset balances 
corporate years ended june  increase percentage decrease change dollars in thousands results of operations selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges na operating loss selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from the prior year to  this was primarily due to a special  one time discretionary bonus of  paid to our executive chairman in recognition of his distinguished service from our inception through december   an executive level bonus accrual of  for calendar year  the write off of  of deferred offering costs as a result of the fact that our proposed initial public offering was postponed more than days and increased infrastructure in advance of our initial public offering 
these increases were offset by a decrease in share based compensation of liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at june   our cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately  at june   we had  available on the revolving credit facility  there was a  balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility at june   and there were outstanding letters of credit in the amount of  associated with foreign supplier contracts and  associated with a power supply contract 
in connection with the sale of a interest in wva llc to dow corning  we agreed to modify the terms of our senior credit facility 
the modifications included a reduction of revolving credit from  to  in exchange for the release of the assets of west virginia a lloys  inc as security for the senior credit facility 
subsequent to june   our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by  from the proceeds received from our us initial public offering  which was completed on august  our subsidiaries borrow funds in order to finance capital expansion programs 
the terms of certain of those financing arrangements place restrictions on distributions of funds to us  however  we do not expect this to have an impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
we believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditure  mandatory debt redemptions  and working capital for our existing businesses 
these resources include cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities  and unused lines of credit 
given the current uncertainty in the financial markets  our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so may change 
should we be required to raise capital in this environment  potential outcomes might include higher borrowing costs  less available capital  more stringent terms and tighter covenants  or in extreme conditions  an inability to raise capital 
our ability to satisfy debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry  as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a summary of our revolving credit agreements is as follows revolving credit agreements as part of the dow corning transactions  we agreed to modify the terms of our senior credit facility  which included a reduction of revolving credit from  to  in exchange for the release of the assets of west virginia alloys  inc as a security for the senior credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies and hedging strategies 
obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies involves the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials or the identification and effective implementation of long term leasing rights or supply agreements 
we enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain commodity price  interest rate  and foreign currency risks 
we do not engage in commodity  interest rate  or currency speculation  and no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
all derivatives are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we believe it is not practical to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments as defined under asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging asc 
accordingly  we adjust our derivative financial instruments to current market value through the consolidated statement of operations based on the fair value of the agreement as of period end 
although not designated as hedged items as defined under asc  these derivative instruments serve to significantly offset our commodity  interest rate  and currency risks 
gains or losses from these transactions offset gains or losses on the assets  liabilities  or transactions being hedged 
no credit loss is anticipated as the counterparties to our derivative agreements are major financial institutions that are highly rated 
the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below 
see our june  consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies 
commodity prices we are exposed to price risk for certain raw materials and energy used in our production process 
the raw materials and energy which we use are largely commodities  subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand and governmental controls 
derivative financial instruments are not used extensively to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of commodity products used in our operations 
we attempt to reduce the impact of increases in our raw material and energy costs by negotiating long term contracts and through the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials with favorable pricing terms 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts that result in stable  favorably priced long term commitments for the majority of our power needs 
additionally  we have long term lease mining rights in the us that supply us with a substantial portion of our requirements for quartzite 
we also have obtained a captive supply of electrodes through our ownership interest in yonvey 
in june  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity  representing approximately of the total power required by our niagara falls  new york plant 
this hedge covers our expected needs not supplied by the facility s long term power contract over the term of the hedge agreement 
the notional amount decreases equally per month through the agreement s expiration on june  under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our power hedge agreement at june  is included in other long term liabilities 
to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure to rising raw material and energy prices  we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset such potential raw material or energy price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations 
at june   we had approximately  of variable rate debt 
to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of our senior term loan  we have entered into an interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements with investment grade financial institutions 
in connection with our revolving credit facility and senior term loan  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement and three interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement to cap libor on a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter through the interest rate cap s expiration on june  under the interest rate cap  we capped libor at a maximum of over the life of the agreement 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in january  we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in april  we entered into a third interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to an  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  per quarter 
under the interest rate swap  we receive libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
the agreement expires in june in connection with our export prepayment financing arrangement  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of interest obligations relating to a  notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by  on a semiannual basis through august  and a final  notional amount swapped for the six month period ended january under the interest rate swap  we received libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement 
this agreement  as well as the related export prepayment financing arrangement  was transferred with the sale of the manufacturing operations of globe metais 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at june  is included in other long term liabilities 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of operations outside the united states  principally in argentina and china 
a portion of our net sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of our operating costs for our us operations are denominated in local currencies  principally the argentine peso and the chinese renminbi 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us dollar sales  and related accounts receivable balances  and our operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
derivative instruments are not used extensively to manage this risk 
we have utilized derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  to manage a portion of our net foreign currency exposure to the brazilian real and the euro 
all of the brazilian real contracts were settled prior to the sale of the manufacturing operations of globe metais 
at june   we had foreign exchange forward contracts covering approximately  euros  expiring at dates ranging from july to september  at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities at june  if foreign exchange rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year  as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations
