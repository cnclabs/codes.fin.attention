as a management concern  a new strategy has been turned from extending of the sales to reducing the balance of accounts receivables 
the company believes there are two main influences on the current state of the cellular phone market in the prc 
first  the reorganization of domestic telecommunication operators has created a lag in market demand 
in particular  the market demand for high margin products during was much lower than expected

the company is aware of the possibility that the market for cellular phones in the prc will experience a moderate increase in the early part of  but it still projects that the industry will be in a better position in because a the reorganization of prc telecom carriers is projected to lead to market development  and b new g technology is also likely to encourage market demand

expenses r d expenses depreciation and amortization loss from write off trade deposits allowance for doubtful accounts interest expenses other expenses income  net loss income before income tax expenses current tax expenses deferred income tax benefit net income loss critical accounting policies and management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis and use them on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates because of different assumptions or conditions 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers financial condition  the amount of receivables in dispute  and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing that asset to its present working condition and location for its intended use 
expenditures incurred after the assets have been put into operation  such as repairs and maintenance  overhaul and minor renewals and betterments  are normally charged to operating expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the assets  the expenditure is capitalized

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible asset subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if circumstances require a long lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment  the company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
no impairment of long lived assets was recognized for the years ended december  and advertising expenses advertising  which generally represents the cost of promotions to create or stimulate a positive image of the company or a desire to buy the company s products and services  is expensed as incurred 
the company had no advertising expenses for the years ended december  and income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions and requires that an entity recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
the company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits  if and when required  as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
foreign currency translation the financial position and results of operations of the company s subsidiaries in the prc are measured using the renminbi as the functional currency  while the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at the prevailing exchange rate in effect at each period end 
income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period 
translation adjustments are included in the cumulative translation adjustment account in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income 
fair value measurements the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  fair value measurements  for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements 
asc subtopic also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc subtopic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value  the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
asc subtopic establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
asc subtopic establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  and earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss attributable to the company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur upon the exercise of outstanding warrants 
common share equivalents are excluded from the computation of the diluted earnings per share when their effect would be anti dilutive 
segment reporting the company has one operating segment  which is designing  manufacturing and distributing economically priced cellular phones for retail and wholesale distribution 
substantially all of the company s operations and customers are located in the prc 
consequently  no geographic information is presented 
contingencies in the normal course of business  the company is subject to loss contingencies  such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business  that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  government investigations and tax matters 
an accrual for a loss contingency is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation asc requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the company records the cost as expense over the offering period and vesting term in connection with compensation expense for stock based employee compensation plans

products segment in order to offset the impact of reduced demand for customized cell phones on our revenues  the company took advantage of our long standing ties to traditional mass market distribution channels and was able to increase sales of our gsm products 
we also increased our trading activities in order to broaden our sources of revenue

tianjin communications broadcast company total for the twelve months ended december   our revenues were derived mainly from sales to beijing xingwang shidai tech trading co  ltd 
xwsd and tianjin communications broadcast company tcb in the amounts of us  and us  respectively 
xwsd has been our most important customer for a long period of time 
it is one of the largest distributors and dealers in mainland china and has sales networks in major cities in the prc 
cost of sales and operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  our operating expenses were us  which included sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses  depreciation and allowance for doubtful account 
the following table shows operating expenses by category for the twelve months ended december  and the corresponding period for twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  comparison us of revenue us of revenue us cost of sales operating expenses selling expenses general admin 
expenses r d expenses depreciation and amortization loss from write off trade deposits allowance for doubtful accounts total operating expenses cost of sales for the twelve months ended december   our cost of sales was us  or of revenues 
the ratio of cost of sales to revenues increased by  as compared to for the twelve months ended december  the increase of the cost is due to the reducing of the profit margin in the industry 
selling expenses the company s major selling expenses are the salaries of sales personnel and the costs of marketing and transportation 
for the twelve months ended december   the company s selling expenses were us  or of revenues a decrease of compared to analogous expenses of us  or of the revenues  for the corresponding period in this decrease was caused by a reduction in personnel while changing our business model which  in turn  led to a decrease in monies needed for office expenses  transportation costs  salaries and social insurances 
in addition  the cost of after sale maintenance services was shifted to our materials suppliers  and the cost of all after sale services other than employee salaries  were borne by our cooperative partners 
this resulted in a significant reduction of our sales and marketing expenses 
research and development r d expenses our r d expenses were us  or of total revenue  for the twelve months ended december   which represented a decrease over the us  of total revenue spent on r d during the significant decrease was due to the company s focus on more traditional r d initiatives and the fact that it did not launch full r d projects for development of new products during the current year 
this decision was considered prudent in light of the potential impact from the pending telecom industrial reorganization in the prc 
general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of compensation for personnel  depreciation  travel expenses  rental costs  materials expenses related to ordinary administration  and fees for professional services 
for the twelve months ended december   the company s general and administrative expenses were us  or of the total revenue  representing a decrease of us  or when compared with us  or of the total revenues for the corresponding period in the sharp decrease was primarily a result of structural adjustments  internal control and cost reduction 
at the same time  there was an expense related to issuing stock options during the year ended december   but there was no such expense in the year ended at december  gross margin and gross margin percentage for the twelve months ended december   our gross margin was us  reflecting a decrease of us  or  compared to a us  gross margin for the same period of in addition  our gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was  representing a decrease of as compared to for the same period of the company believes that the change in its gross margin percentage can be attributed to the significant decrease of sales volume in past year 
we have analyzed details reasons for this change in item business review 
it should be noted that though our gross margin percentage was slowing down in  it was still above 
this fact reflects our relatively stable customer group and sales channels 
other expenses income  net for the twelve months ended december   other expense was us  representing a decrease of us  compared with other income of us  for the same period of the significant decrease is due to liability accrued for the penalty arose from purchasing contract please refer to note of the financial statements  net income loss for the twelve months ended december   our net loss was us  and our net loss margin percentage was which represents a decrease of us  or  compared to the us  in net profit and corresponding net profit margin percentage of earned during the same period of the significant decrease for the net profit loss compared with the year ended december  arose from the significant bad debt provision with the amount of us  and the loss from write off trade deposit with the amounts of us  in  after splitting the possible bad debt out the receivable accounts  the company will strengthen the cash flow management and account receivables collection and continue its on going monitoring to maintain a more solid and strong net profit level 
liquidity and source of capital we generally finance our operations with internally generated cash flow and short term financing from domestic banks 
as of december   we had current assets of us  current assets are mainly comprised of accounts receivable of us  trade deposits paid of us  cash and cash equivalents of us  pledged deposits of us  other current assets of us  and restricted cash of us  as of december   our current liabilities were us  which included accounts payable of us  trade deposits received of us  short term loans of us  accrued expenses and other accrued liabilities of us  taxes payable of us  and amounts due to directors of us  and liability for possible settlement to accounts payable of us  the liability for possible settlement to accounts payable of us  arose from the provision of penalty for unpaid accounts payable to suppliers as of december  in the purchase contracts signed between suppliers and the company since  an agreed term between boxt and the suppliers acknowledges that any outstanding payment which exceeds the agreed payment schedule  will be imposed on an additional per day delayed payment penalty based on principle amount of contract liability 
however  some of such purchase contracts were signed before  according to relevant prc civil laws and regulations  if the creditors did not claim for the right in writing to the company within two years since the date on which the liability was due  the periods of prescription will be expired after two years from the date on which the liability was due 
we note that at the meanwhile  no any legal letters related to this part penalty arising from outstanding payment 
liability were issued from our suppliers in past years 
however  from the point of prudence principle  we accrued this liability based on the terms of the contract 
at december  the accrued possible penalty provided based on such penalty term is us  and this liability has been recorded in the other expenses of statement of operations for the year ended december  we offer two different trading terms to our customers cash on delivery or credit terms of days 
as of december   our accounts receivable had decreased by us  to us  as compared with us  on december  the decrease in accounts receivable was due mainly to the management of the company strengthening the payment collection policy 
however  since the business expansion and development  the new receivables are recorded at the same time the old receivables were collected  and as such  the ending balance of account receivables maintains a high level and no significant decrease was noted 
we will continue to pay close attention to the liquidity of our distributors 
as previously disclosed  in order to reduce the risk of default  we have limited the terms of credit offered to our major distributor in the master distributor agreement and have asked a third party surety company to guarantee the accounts receivable due from this distributor 
for additional information  please see the company s current report on its form k dated august  as of december   we had certain accounts receivable that had been outstanding for more than days because adverse macro economic development conditions had caused comparatively longer collection terms to our sales channels as a whole 
we decided it was in our best interest not to strictly enforce the terms of collection in order to maintain our current cooperation relationships  but we will modify the delivery schedule for future goods to these customers 
as of december   our trade deposits paid were us  which represented a decrease of us  as compared to us  in trade deposits paid as of december  the decrease was due to a deposit of approximately us  that was written off during the year ended december  as of december   our other current assets were us  a decrease of us  as compared to us  in other current assets we had as of december  the other current assets are mainly composed of receivables to individuals 
the ending balance of the year is not material compared with the year of as of december   we had pledged deposits of us  was paid to zhonghui  a guarantee company for the loan from beijing rural commercial bank 
changes in currency exchange rates caused the value of the pledged deposits to increase by us  over the course of the fiscal year 
as of december   our accounts payable were us  which represented a decrease of us  or  as compared to us  in accounts payable as of december  the main reason for this decease was that the management encouraged the timely payment to the suppliers 
as of december   accrued expenses and liabilities were us  which represented an increase of us  or  as compared to the us  in accrued expenses and liabilities that the company had as of december  the increase was due to the accumulated accrued interests in the year during fiscal year we made no allowance for warranty problems because  during this period  after sale services for newly launched products were undertaken by oem factories  rather than the company 
therefore  allowances were not made accordingly for these after sale services 
as of december   our income taxes payable were us  which represented an increase of us  or  as compared to our us  in taxes payable as of december  as of december   our vat taxes payable were us  which represented an increase of us  or  as compared to our us  in taxes payable as of december  as of december   cash and bank balances were mainly denominated in renminbi rmb 
our revenue and expenses  assets and liabilities are  for the most part  denominated in rmb and us dollars usd 
our company operations are mainly denominated in rmb 
during the accounting period  rmb currency is quoted officially against usd currency according to a floating exchange rate

tax penalty in accordance with the prc s tax regulations  boxt s sales are subject to a of value added tax vat upon the sales made to customers 
boxt follows the practice of reporting its revenue with vat invoices issued to prc tax authorities for vat purposes

the sales revenue of the year ended december  and is us  and us  respectively  representing us  and us  output vat  respectively 
at the meanwhile  the input vat which the invoice has been received was us  and us  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
therefore  the net vat payable is us  and us  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
according to prc tax law  only the input vat supported with sufficient invoice could be deducted from current period s output vat 
for the purchasing without obtaining any invoices  the related input vat is not allowed to be deducted

furthermore  boxt reports its revenue for prc enterprise income tax eit purposes when vat invoices are issued rather than when goods are delivered 
all unbilled revenue will become taxable when invoices are issued 
the above practice is not in strict compliance with the relevant prc laws and regulations in respect of vat and eit

the board of directors considers it is not probable the penalty will be imposed

the company  in its normal course of business  is exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates with respect to bank loans 
as of december   company bank loans were us  the interest rate for the twelve months ended december  was between and per annum 
currency risk the company considers rmb its functional currency since a substantial portion of the company s business activities are based in rmb 
however  the company has chosen the united states dollar as its reporting currency 
our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in rmb 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of the rmb  there can be no assurance that its rate of exchange will not again become volatile or that the rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
in addition  the rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions 
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the period are translated into the functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange at the time of the transactions 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency are translated into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
exchange gains and losses are recorded in the combined statements of operations 
for translation of financial statements into the reporting currency  assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date  equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates  and revenues  expenses  gains and losses are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
when there are material adjustments under this process  they are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income under the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
country risk our business  assets and operations are located and conducted in the prc 
while the prc s economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years  growth has been uneven  both geographically and among various sectors of the economy 
the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources 
some of these measures benefit the overall economy of the prc  but may also have a negative effect on us 
for example  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations applicable to us 
if there are any changes in any policies by the prc government and our business is negatively affected as a result  then our financial results  including our ability to generate revenues and profits  will also be negatively affected
