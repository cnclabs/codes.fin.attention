overview vivus  inc is a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in  dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for large underserved markets 
currently  we have one drug that has been approved by the fda  and several investigational product candidates in late stages of clinical development  and we are focused on market opportunities in obesity and related morbidities including sleep apnea and diabetes and sexual health 
with respect to obesity  it is estimated that the potential worldwide pharmaceutical market for obesity could approach billion annually 
annual sales of approved drugs for diabetes currently exceed billion 
there are currently no approved pharmaceutical therapies for sleep apnea  however  the sales of devices and related consumables used to treat sleep apnea exceed billion annually 
the indications targeted by our investigational sexual health product candidates each represent a projected market greater than billion annually 
we market muse  a legacy product  as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the united states and  together with our partners  internationally 

table of contents recent developments on march   we announced that the fda had accepted for filing the new drug application  or nda  for qnexa for the treatment of obesity 
further  the fda has set october  as the date whereby we may expect a response to the review of the nda 
on january   we announced new data from an analysis of the recently completed phase study  revive ta  of avanafil  an investigational product candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  or ed 
patients who attempted intercourse within minutes of dosing were successful  and of the time on  and mg of avanafil  respectively  as compared to of the patients on placebo p 
the previously disclosed top line results of the revive study evaluating the safety and efficacy of avanafil in patients showed that all three doses of avanafil met the fda defined primary study endpoints by demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in erectile function as measured by the sexual encounter profile  or sep and improvements in the international index of erectile function  or iief score 
on january   we announced positive results from a phase study evaluating the safety and efficacy of qnexa  our investigational product  for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea  or osa 
this study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the apnea hypopnea index  or ahi  which is a measure of the severity of sleep apnea  in patients with osa treated with qnexa for weeks 
qnexa treated patients on average had a reduction in sleep apnea and hypopnea events as compared to patients on placebo 
qnexa treated patients also experienced significant weight loss  improvements in blood pressure  and increased blood oxygen saturation during overnight polysomnography sleep lab study 
osa is a sleep related breathing disorder that involves a decrease or complete cessation in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe 
osa is associated with an increased risk of hypertension  diabetes  stroke  myocardial infarction  sudden cardiac death and all cause mortality 
it has been estimated that approximately million americans have sleep apnea  and currently there in no medication approved by the fda for the treatment of osa 
on december   we announced that an nda had been submitted to the fda seeking approval of qnexa for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss  in patients who are obese or overweight with co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia or central adiposity 
qnexa is our proprietary oral investigational product candidate which incorporates low doses of active ingredients from two previously approved products  phentermine and topiramate 
we have previously completed the special protocol assessment  or spa  process and have agreement with the fda regarding key elements of the pivotal phase protocols ob and ob of qnexa for the treatment of obesity and weight related co morbidities 
on november   we announced positive results from revive ta  a phase pivotal study evaluating the safety and efficacy of avanafil  our investigational product candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  or ed  in patients 
the revive study met all primary endpoints across the three doses studied by demonstrating statistically significant improvement in erectile function as measured by the sep and improvements in the iief score 
the pivotal study  conducted under an spa with the fda  also demonstrated successful intercourse in minutes or less after dosing  and a favorable side effect and safety profile 
on september   we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock that provided us with gross proceeds of million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
under this offering  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price per share of and the underwriters purchased  additional shares of common stock at the same price to cover over allotments 
on september   we announced the results of our pivotal phase trials for qnexa  equip ob and conquer ob 

table of contents equip ob the equip study included  morbidly obese patients  females and males across centers in the united states 
the average baseline body mass index  or bmi  of the study population was kg m and baseline weight was pounds a bmi of kg m is classified as obese per guidelines from the us department of health and human services 
patients had a week dose titration period followed by weeks of treatment 
the study was a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  arm  prospective trial with patients randomized to receive once a day treatment with placebo  low dose qnexa or full dose qnexa 
patients were asked to follow a hypocaloric diet representing a calorie day deficit and advised to implement a simple lifestyle modification program 
weight loss results from the study are summarized as follows itt locf completers equip ob weeks placebo n qnexa low dose n qnexa full dose n placebo n qnexa low dose n qnexa full dose n mean weight loss greater than or equal to weight loss rate itt locf intent to treat with last observation carried forward p vs 
placebo conquer ob the conquer study included  overweight and obese patients  females and males with high blood pressure  high cholesterol or type diabetes across centers in the united states 
the average baseline bmi of the study population was kg m and baseline weight was pounds 
patients had a week dose titration period followed by weeks of treatment 
the study was a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  arm  prospective trial with patients randomized to receive once a day treatment with placebo  mid dose qnexa or full dose qnexa 
patients were asked to follow a hypocaloric diet representing a calorie day deficit and advised to implement a simple lifestyle modification program 
weight loss results from the study are summarized as follows itt locf completers conquer ob weeks placebo n qnexa mid dose n qnexa full dose n placebo n qnexa mid dose n qnexa full dose n mean weight loss greater than or equal to weight loss rate p vs 
placebo the primary efficacy endpoint for phase weight loss trials  as recommended by the fda  is at least a mean reduction in baseline body weight compared to placebo or at least of patients losing or more of their baseline body weight 
in europe  the committee for medicinal products for human use of the european medicines agency has recommended that demonstration of significant weight loss of at least of baseline weight is considered to be a valid primary endpoint for anti obesity drugs 
the fda and foreign authorities require pivotal obesity studies to be conducted for at least one year 
although the results for both of our phase studies and all of our phase obesity trials met these current guidelines for efficacy  there can be no assurance that these results will be acceptable to the fda 

table of contents our future our goal is to build a successful biopharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of investigational product candidates in our pipeline  establishing internal capabilities or strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  and licensing complementary clinical stage investigational product candidates or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of products for large underserved markets 
we believe we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity and related disorders such as sleep apnea and diabetes  and sexual health 
our future growth depends on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational product candidates for indications that we are studying  or plan to study  as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  through the sale of the rights to evamist and through product sales of muse alprostadil 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as our various investigational product candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development and for pre commercialization activities 
in connection with the sale of evamist  we received to date an aggregate of million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon the fda s approval of the evamist nda 
these payments were non refundable and were originally recorded as deferred revenue and were recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may  all of the revenue deferred from the evamist sale has been recognized 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to available for sale securities  product returns  rebates and sales reserves  research and development expenses  doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product revenue product sales are recognized as revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales allowances and reserves revenues from product sales are recorded net of product sales allowances for expected returns of expired product  government chargebacks and other rebate programs  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
these sales allowances are deducted from gross product revenues at the time such revenues are recognized along with the recording of a corresponding reserve  or liability 
in making these estimates we take into consideration our historical information  current contractual and statutory requirements  shelf life of our products  estimated customer inventory levels and information received from outside parties 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating the reserve balances in any accounting period 
our product sales allowances and reserves include product returns we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states in accordance with our product returns policy 
our returns policy allows product returns within the period beginning six months prior to and twelve months following product expiration 
we sell one pharmaceutical product  muse  which is sold in four dosages 
the  mcg and mcg product has a month shelf life and  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the mcg and mcg product has an month shelf life 
as of december   the shipments of muse in the united states made in  and a portion of the shipments in remain subject to future returns 
the following table summarizes our product subject to return as of december  period of expiration estimated gross sales value from to in thousands  sep nov  sep oct  jan nov estimated gross sales value of product subject to return as of december  we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience 
there is no right of return on expired product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus  no returns reserve is needed 
we estimate our returns reserve by utilizing historical information and returns data obtained from external sources  along with the shelf life of the product 
we believe that the information obtained from external sources is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we track the actual returns on a lot by lot basis along with date of production and date of expiration 
we review the actual returns experience for trends 
we calculate our returns reserve by applying an estimated return rate to the quantity of units sold that is subject to future return 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the 
table of contents period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
we consider a one percentage point variance in our returns rate to be a reasonably likely change in the percentage of our product returns to related gross sales 
a one percentage point change in the estimated product returns rate recognized on gross sales in would lead to an approximate  effect on our net sales and operating losses 
the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued product returns in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods actual product returns balance at december at december   our returns rate was increased from to  based upon an increasing trend of product returns 
the returns rate of has been used since december  the product returns reserve at december   covering the estimated returns exposure for product shipped in  and a portion of  was estimated at million 
this product returns reserve calculation is based upon the most recent information available  and we believe is reasonable and adequate to cover the estimated future credit memos to be issued for the return of prior sales of muse 
quarterly  we will continue to monitor the product returns experience and make adjustments to the product returns reserve  as appropriate 
chargebacks chargebacks include government chargebacks which are contractual commitments by us to provide muse to federal government organizations including the veterans administration at specified prices and other rebate programs including those with managed care organizations  for the reimbursement of portions of the prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
allowances for chargebacks are recorded at the time of sale to the wholesaler distributors and accrued as a reserve 
in estimating the chargeback reserve  we analyze actual government chargeback and rebate amounts paid and apply chargeback rates to estimates of the quantity of units subject to chargeback 
we estimate this reserve by utilizing historical information  contractual and statutory requirements  end customer prescription demand data  estimated quantities sold to these organizations and estimated wholesaler inventory levels based upon data obtained from our larger wholesaler customers which we began receiving in at that time  we determined the inventory data we had received from the larger wholesaler customers was more reliable than our previous estimates 
this change in estimated wholesaler inventory levels in resulted in a decrease in the chargeback provision of  related to prior period sales 
we believe that the information received from the wholesaler customers regarding inventory levels and information received from external sources regarding end customer prescription demand are reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicare part d 
we routinely reassess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
we consider a two percentage point variance to be a reasonably likely change in the percentage of chargebacks to related gross sales 
a two percentage point change in the estimated chargebacks rate would lead to an approximate  effect on our net sales and operating losses in 
table of contents the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued chargebacks in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods actual chargebacks balance at december cash discounts we offer cash discounts to wholesaler distributors  generally of the sales price as an incentive for prompt payment 
the estimate of cash discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
we account for the cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts we expect wholesaler distributors to take 
the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to cash discounts in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period actual cash discounts balance at december all of the aforementioned categories of sales allowances are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our sales allowance adjustments to fluctuate 
if actual returns  government chargebacks  rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required which could have an adverse effect on financial results in the period of adjustment 
revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
license and other revenue we recognize license revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as codified in the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  or asc when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  as codified in fasb asc topic  subtopic multiple element arrangements  or asc in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements  or such elements are insignificant 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance 
table of contents milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
on may   we closed our transaction with k v for the sale of our product candidate  evamist  a metered dose transdermal spray for the treatment of menopause symptoms 
at the time of the sale  evamist was an investigational product and was not yet approved by the fda for marketing 
the sale transaction contained multiple deliverables  including the delivery at closing of the evamist assets mainly raw material inventory and certain fixed assets  a grant of a sublicense of our rights under a license related to evamist  and a license to the mdts applicator  the delivery upon receipt of regulatory approval of evamist  along with all regulatory submissions  and  lastly  the delivery after fda approval of certain transition services and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
we received approval from the fda to market evamist on july   or fda approval  and on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions  and all files related thereto to k v 
in august  we assigned all of our rights and obligations under the evamist license agreement to k v 
we received an upfront payment of million in may upon the closing and received an additional million milestone payment in august upon fda approval 
these payments are non refundable 
we evaluated this multiple deliverable arrangement to determine whether the deliverables were divided into separate units of accounting 
upon fda approval  the two remaining deliverables were the transition services to be performed under the transition services agreement  or tsa  and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator  or improvement license  during the two year period commencing with the closing  or may   and ending on may  we were able to establish fair value for the tsa 
as it relates to the improvement license  no specific value was assigned in the agreement 
we had no obligation to develop improvements to the mdts applicator and had no plans to expend significant resources in this endeavor 
however  we did not have objective  reliable evidence of fair value or evidence of inconsequential value to the customer of the improvement license 
accordingly  the delivered items  together with the undelivered items  were bundled together and were treated as one unit of accounting 
as a result  the initial million paid at closing and the million paid upon fda approval were recorded as deferred revenue and have been recognized as license revenue ratably over the month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  the revenue related to the transaction recognized for years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
amends the guidance for measurement and separation of deliverables in multiple element arrangements under eitf issue  as codified in fasb asc  and significantly increases the related disclosure requirements 
under this new guidance  which will be effective for us beginning january   our accounting for the revenue from the sale of the evamist transaction may have been different 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs at other companies and research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical sites and include advertising for clinical trials and patient recruitment costs 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses and are expensed as incurred 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers for product sales resulting in accounts receivable 
customer accounts are monitored for past due amounts 
past due accounts receivable  determined to be uncollectible  are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based upon past due amounts  historical losses and existing economic factors  and are adjusted periodically 
the accounts receivable are reported on the consolidated balance sheet  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts table 
this summarizes the activity in the accounts related to allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was considered more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as codified in fasb asc  income taxes  to clarify certain aspects of accounting for 
table of contents uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the adoption date 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognized a decrease of approximately million in our income tax liability  which resulted in a decrease of million in accumulated deficit on january  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against our inventory to align with the then new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million relating to raw materials and components 
in the first quarter of  we determined that we likely would continue to use some portion of the fully reserved component parts inventory in production 
in the third quarter of  we determined that we would also likely use some portion of the fully reserved raw materials inventory 
when we record inventory reserves  we establish a new  lower cost basis for the inventory for accounting purposes 
accordingly  to the extent that this fully reserved inventory was used in production in the years ended december   and it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
during the second quarter of  a portion of our existing inventory of alprostadil exceeded its shelf life and is no longer usable in the manufacturing of muse 
we increased our inventory reserves by  for this raw material 
we do not expect the loss of this material to impede our ability to meet the demand for muse 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   all cash equivalents are invested in money market funds and us treasury securities 
these accounts are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
cash with restrictions for a period of greater than months is classified as restricted cash  a non current asset 
available for sale securities we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
our investment policy  as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors  allows us to invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired we would experience losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 

table of contents we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
we may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than months until maturity 
in response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity requirements  we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities 
as these securities are viewed by us as available to support current operations securities with maturities beyond months are classified as current assets 
securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity  unless the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we intend to sell such securities before recovering their costs  in which case such securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to other than temporary loss on impaired securities 
we evaluate our investment securities for other than temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification method  and such gains and losses are reflected as a component of interest income 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fsp sfas and sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp sfas and sab topic m  accounting for non current marketable equity securities  as codified in fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities  or asc  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp is effective for all periods ending after june  and provides additional guidance designed to create a greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
in reviewing our non us government available for sale securities  we concluded that we intend to sell the debt securities before recovering their costs and consequently these securities are included in our assessment of other than temporarily impaired securities 
for securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations 
during our quarterly impairment assessments  we determined that a decline in value of certain securities was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded other than temporary impairment adjustments of  in the year ended december  we included this non cash impairment charge in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
these securities covered a number of industries 
during our quarterly impairment assessments in  we also determined that a decline in value of certain securities was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded other than temporary impairment adjustments of million in the year ended december  we included this non cash impairment charge in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
included in the charge taken in was million related to corporate bonds issued by lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman or their respective subsidiaries  as appropriate 
on september   lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
accordingly  recovery of the full value of our lehman bonds  if any  was deemed remote and we recognized an other than temporary impairment in the year ended december  in addition  other than temporary impairments recognized in included impairments on investments for which we determined the impairment was other than temporary due to credit downgrades and or our intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these securities covered a number of industries 
in addition  due to the lack of a readily available market for certain of our available for sale securities totaling million and the continued uncertainty in the capital markets in  we expected to recover the carrying values of these securities 
table of contents beyond the next months 
consequently  we classified those available for sale securities as non current in the consolidated balance sheets at december  contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we record legal fees and costs as an expense when incurred 
share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  as codified in fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we recorded million  million and million of share based compensation expense for the years ended december    and  respectively 
share based compensation expense is allocated among cost of goods sold and manufacturing  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function of the related employee 
this charge had no impact on our cash flows for the periods presented 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility

fair value on january   we adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements  as codified in fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  and effective october   we adopted fsp no 
sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  except as it applies to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to fsp on january   we adopted sfas no with respect to non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
on june  we adopted fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the assets or liabilities have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
adoption of the provisions of these standards did not have a material effect on our financial position 

table of contents financial instruments measured at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale financial instruments are carried at fair value and we make estimates regarding valuation of these assets measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement definition and hierarchy 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation technique 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of vivus 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
sfas no 
prescribes three valuation techniques that shall be used to measure fair value as follows market approach uses prices or other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount discounted 
cost approach the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ie  current replacement cost 
one or a combination of the approaches above can be used to calculate fair value  whichever results in the most representative fair value 
in addition to the three valuation techniques  sfas no 
prescribes a fair value hierarchy in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
these types of instruments primarily consist of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as cash  money market funds and us treasury securities that are actively traded 
management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions is met for a market to be considered active 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed products 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these types of instruments have included certain corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
we have no level securities as of december  level is comprised of 
table of contents unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these instruments are considered level when their fair values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
level may still include some observable inputs such as yield spreads derived from markets with limited activity 
level financial assets include securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation 
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace  and other characteristics particular to the transaction 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
fair value measurements as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled million 
all of our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in cash  money market instruments and us treasury securities at december   and these are classified as level the valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of these financial instruments were derived from quoted market prices  as substantially all of these instruments have maturity dates  if any  within one year from the date of purchase and active markets for these instruments exists 
deerfield financing on april   we entered into several agreements with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates  deerfield private design fund lp and deerfield private design international  lp collectively  the deerfield affiliates 
certain of these agreements were amended and restated on march  please refer to note deerfield financing and note notes payable to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information on these agreements 
under the agreements  deerfield and its affiliates agreed to provide million in funding to the company 
the million in funding consists of million from the funding and royalty agreement  or fara  and million from the sale of the company s common stock 
under the fara  the deerfield affiliates made million payments to us in april  september  and december and february  june and september  constituting all of the required payments under the fara 
we have agreed to pay royalties on the current net sales of muse and if approved  on future sales of avanafil  an investigational product candidate  to the deerfield sub  a newly incorporated subsidiary of deerfield 
the agreements also provide us with an option to purchase  and the deerfield affiliates with an option to compel us to purchase  the deerfield sub holding the royalty rights 
if either party exercises its option  any further royalty payments would be effectively terminated 
in exchange for the option right  we paid million to the deerfield affiliates 
we have evaluated the deerfield financing in accordance with fasb financial interpretation no  or fin  r  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r  as codified in fasb asc topic  consolidation  or asc  and determined that the deerfield sub may constitute a variable interest entity  or vie  however  we have also determined that the company is not the primary beneficiary of this vie at this time and we therefore have concluded that we are not required to consolidate the deerfield sub 

table of contents in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  sale of future revenues  as codified in fasb asc  the transaction is in substance a financing arrangement  or loan that will be repaid by us 
the minimum repayment amount would be million  the amount of the unconditional put option held by deerfield affiliates  plus royalties paid on muse sales  and avanafil sales if approved  during the term of the agreement 
accordingly  we have recorded the advances from the deerfield affiliates  net of the million option right payment and related fees and expenses  as a loan 
using the interest method under apb opinion no 
 interest on receivables and payables  as codified in fasb asc topic  interest  subtopic  imputation of interest or asc  interest on the loan will be recognized over three years  which is the estimated term of the loan based on the earliest date that the deerfield affiliates could require us to repay the amounts advanced 
results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million or net loss per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share during the same period in the increased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a decrease in license and other revenue recognized on the portion of k v deferred license revenue from the sale of evamist amortized in as compared to  where we recognized a full year of deferred revenue  partially offset by decreased operating expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to reduced spending on qnexa for obesity  partially offset by increased spending related to our phase clinical trials of avanafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and increased selling  general and administrative expense primarily due to qnexa pre commercialization expenses and an increase in non cash share based compensation expense 
in addition  we had a reduction in other than temporary impairment losses in as compared to in  we also had a million benefit for income taxes primarily due to a carryback claim of losses generated in which allows us to obtain a refund for federal income taxes which we paid in on april   we entered into several agreements with deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates 
certain of these agreements were amended and restated on march  under the agreements deerfield and its affiliates provided million in funding to us 
the million in funding included million from the fara  and million from the sale of the company s common stock at the closing on april  in connection with the registered direct offering mentioned above under a securities purchase agreement 
under the fara  the deerfield affiliates made million payments to us in april  september and december and february  june and september  constituting all of the required payments under the fara 
the amounts of funding provided under the fara  net of certain amounts  represent a financial obligation  a loan payable by the company in which the principal and interest will be repaid through royalty payments and the exercise of the option or put rights 
in connection with the sale of evamist  we received million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon fda approval of evamist 
these payments were non refundable and were recorded as deferred revenue and have been recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may   which was the remaining term of a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
no improvements to the mdts applicator were made during this period 
as compared to revenues from product sales  license and other revenue was significant on a quarterly basis during this month period 
since the million was received and we had no related contingencies  the recognition of revenue and the corresponding reduction of deferred revenue related to the evamist sale had no impact on our cash flows from operations during this period 
the revenue related to the evamist transaction recognized in was million 

table of contents we may have continued losses in future years  depending on the timing of our research and development expenditures  because we expect muse sales to remain consistent with prior years and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and investigational product candidates to bring those potential products to market 
revenue change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages united states product  net international product license and other revenue total revenues worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  an increase of  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in us product revenues increased in as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher prices for muse and a modest increase in units shipped 
the increase in us product revenues for was partially offset by both an increase in the sales allowance for pricing discounts for certain government customers of  and an allowance of  for out of specification production identified in the first quarter of domestic demand for muse at the retail and government level remains consistent with the prior period  averaging just less than  units per quarter 
similar to prior years  in the fourth quarter  our largest wholesaler customer made purchases that were greater than current demand 
based upon fourth quarter demand for muse  we estimate purchases made by wholesaler customers in the fourth quarter represent approximately months of excess demand 
in the fourth quarter and prior years  at least one other major wholesaler customer had also purchased quantities in excess of demand 
the increase in muse domestic shipments is a result of fluctuations in inventory levels at the wholesale level and is not indicative of any trend 
the decrease in international revenue in as compared to was principally due to decreases in units shipped based upon the timing of orders from our international partners and to a reduction in transfer prices resulting from the difference in currency exchange rates 
if these exchange rate differences and lower transfer prices were to occur again  our future international product revenue would be negatively impacted 
also contributing to the reduction in international revenues in was the allowance of  for certain out of specification production identified in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  through our routine testing  we identified that certain production lots of the lower strength muse shipped did not meet certain specifications applied toward the end of the month shelf life 
this out of specification condition appears to arise in the last six months of the month shelf life 
this condition does not pose any safety risk to patients 
in may  we issued a voluntary recall of specific lots of mcg and mcg muse product remaining in the us wholesaler s inventory 
units of mcg and mcg represented of total domestic units shipped in in september  we received approval from the fda to reduce the shelf life of our mcg and mcg muse product from months to months and we are currently manufacturing the mcg and mcg muse product with an month shelf life 
during the fourth quarter of  we began shipping mcg and mcg muse product with an month shelf life 
we offered an exchange of product with the month shelf life for any product with the month shelf life remaining in the wholesalers inventories and  in the fourth quarter of  we completed the product exchange 

table of contents we believe all affected product has now been returned by the wholesalers and the final cost of the recall and exchange was  although the demand for muse has stabilized  we are not able to anticipate if our largest wholesaler customer will continue its historical pattern of making purchases in the fourth quarter that exceed expected quarterly demand 
if our largest wholesaler customer does not repeat this pattern of purchasing quantities of muse that exceed quarterly demands  revenues from the sale of muse in may be lower as compared to on march   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with k v  to transfer our assets and grant a sublicense of our rights under the evamist agreement to k v  or the transaction 
in august  we assigned all of our rights and obligations under the evamist license agreement to k v 
the closing of the transaction occurred on may  and on july  we received fda approval of the evamist nda 
an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon fda approval 
these payments were recorded as deferred revenue and have been recognized as revenue ratably over the month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in us product revenues decreased in as compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in shipments of muse partially offset by a price increase for in  product revenue was higher due to an adjustment to our sales allowances for chargebacks of  the sales adjustment in was the result of updated information received from certain wholesaler customers of the inventory in the distribution channel 
the decrease in international revenues in is mainly due to the timing of orders from our international distributors as well as adjustments to our sales allowance in the increase in license and other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of the k v deferred license revenue

we expensed approximately million of manufacturing overhead costs in the year ended december   as compared to million during the same period in as period costs because of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility 
this accounting treatment is due to the fact that the manufacturing capacity of the new jersey plant far exceeds the level of production 
cost of goods sold and manufacturing  or cost of goods sold  in the year ended december  decreased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of goods sold is primarily due to a one time charge of  for the sale of evamist assets in may partially offset by the disposal of inventory due to the non conformance of certain raw materials in we expensed approximately million of

the current remaining contractual obligation for payments to our primary contract research organization  or cro  for the phase avanafil trials totals million  which includes amounts in accrued research and clinical expenses as of december  there are likely to be additional research and development expenses related to avanafil and our other investigational products under development 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and pre clinical studies 
regardless  if we are successful in obtaining fda regulatory approval for any new investigational product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts  we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of such new products  if any  for at least a year or more due to the length of time required to develop investigational product candidates into commercially viable products 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased spending for our investigational product candidates currently in phase clinical trials

interest income and expense interest income  net for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year was largely due to lower interest rates  year over year  on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in us government securities  which earn lower rates of interest

there was no other than temporary impairment losses in the year ended december  from and until december  we had an investment in the bank of america columbia strategic cash portfolio  or strategic cash  offered by our investment advisor  columbia management llc  or columbia 
strategic cash was an enhanced money market fund in which the fund sought to maintain a per share net asset value 
in early december  we were notified by columbia that the strategic cash fund was closed and that the fund was to be liquidated 
the fund no longer supported the per share net asset value and switched to a market value fund in which all investments were marked to market 
we were given the option of staying in the fund and receiving cash proceeds from the fund as its holdings were liquidated or receiving a pro rata share of the investments held by the fund 
upon advice from our investment advisor  columbia  we took redemption in kind distribution consisting of cash  interest receivable and a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  consisting principally of corporate debt and asset backed securities 
prior to the redemption our investment in strategic cash was million 
on december  and december   we received our redemption in kind distribution consisting of securities with a market value of million  interest receivable of  and cash of million

the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired  we would experience realized or unrealized losses in the value of our portfolio  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
investment securities are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities  it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near term could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations or shareholders equity

table of contents right to compel us to purchase the deerfield sub at a price of million 
this price could increase up to million  and the timing of the sale of the shares could be accelerated under certain conditions including a change in control  sale of muse or avanafil  sale of major assets and the sale of securities in a transaction or a series of related transactions by the company that exceed of our outstanding common stock at the date the option and put agreement was signed if at the time of the sale the company s market capitalization is below million each  a major transaction 
under these conditions  the cost of the shares of the deerfield sub would be million on or before april  and million from april  through april  the sale of the shares of the deerfield sub could also accelerate if the company s cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities falls below million or the company s market capitalization falls below million 
the purchase prices under the put right are subject to other adjustments as defined in the agreements 
if either party exercises its option  any further royalty payments would be effectively terminated 
in exchange for the option right  we paid million to the deerfield affiliates 
our intellectual property and all of the accounts receivable  inventory and equipment arising out of or relating to muse and avanafil are collateral for this transaction 
on may   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s file number  which was declared effective by the sec on may   providing us with the ability to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of our common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
on may   we filed with the sec a post effective amendment no 
to form s file no 
 which was filed with the sec on july   to deregister any securities registered and not otherwise sold thereunder 
on august   we sold million of our common stock in a registered direct offering 
under the terms of the financing  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on august   the company filed a prospectus supplement with the sec relating to this registered direct offering under the existing shelf registration statement file number 
on september   we entered into an underwriting agreement  or the underwriting agreement  with jp morgan securities inc  as representative of the several underwriters named therein  or the underwriters  relating to the public offering and sale of  shares of our common stock 
pursuant to the underwriting agreement  the underwriters agreed to purchase  subject to customary closing conditions   shares of our common stock

the  shares were sold at a price to the public of per share which resulted in approximately million in gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
the transaction closed on september  the offering was made pursuant to the effective shelf registration statement on form s registration no

the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials and approval by the fda may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational product candidate 
it is also important to note that if an investigational product candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 

table of contents the nature and efforts required to develop our investigational product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  pre clinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each investigational product candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of matters arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that an investigational product candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our investigational product programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our investigational product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish substantial evidence of safety and efficacy 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently fail to establish safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our investigational product programs are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and investigational product programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular  our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon or be impacted by numerous factors  including the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations  sublicenses and strategic alliances  the costs involved in establishing a commercial operation and in launching a product without a partner  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  
table of contents the ultimate results of the stability of the batches of qnexa produced for commercialization the results of operations  demand for muse  the potential forced purchase of the royalty streams we previously sold to deerfield  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the state of the economy and financing environment  the regulatory approval environment and regulatory hurdles for safety assessment for new products  the health care reimbursement system or the impact of healthcare reform  if any  imposed by the us federal government  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  adverse perceptions and interpretations of qnexa or the data by outside analysts or others  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least into however  we anticipate that we may require additional funding to continue our research and investigational product development programs  to conduct pre clinical studies and trials  to fund operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  to finance the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional or new manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future  to manufacture quantities of our investigational product candidates for approval and commercialization  or to launch a product 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to the inventor of qnexa pending approval by the fda  acrux and mtpc  in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
similar to the transaction with evamist  we may consider selling or licensing any of our products in development or our commercial product in order to raise additional funding 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets at any time 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  acquisitions of companies with cash balances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our investigational product development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or investigational product candidates and to pay royalties on future product sales 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses may result in future losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or sell one or more of our products or investigational product candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if approved for sale  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit

indemnifications in the normal course of business  the company provides indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products and to its clinical research organizations and investigators sites against liabilities incurred in connection with any third party claim arising from the work performed on behalf of the company  among others 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement for the sale of the evamist product to k v  the company made certain representations and warranties concerning its rights and assets related to evamist and the company s authority to enter into and consummate the transaction 
the company also made certain covenants that survive the closing date of the transaction  including a covenant not to operate a business that competes  in the united states  and its territories and protectorates  with the evamist product

covenants include that we will maintain all registrations and regulatory rights to sell and promote muse in the united states  we will continue to manufacture and promote muse and will continue the development of avanafil 
we also entered into a covenant that we will not manufacture  promote or sell any product that competes with avanafil in the united states other than muse 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could 
table of contents be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal

table of contents cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our investigational product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
for more information about the risks we face  see item a risk factors included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
market and interest rate risk our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and us treasury securities 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors that specifies the categories money market funds  us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
currently  we have focused on investing in us treasuries until market conditions improve 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment may decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
in addition  continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the 
table of contents event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and may cause stock price volatility 
our investment policy  as approved by our board of directors  allows us to invest in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities that are not federally insured 
given the current economic instability  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on the million loan payable to crown bank  na as of december  the loan is payable over a year term 
the interest rate is adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus  with a floor of 
the interest rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange and foreign economic conditions risk we receive international revenue from distributors selling products outside the united states 
we charge these distributors in us dollars and they sell in their local denomination 
in addition  we guarantee a minimum margin percentage  which is affected by current foreign exchange rates 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which our licensed products are sold 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates is most significant relative to the euro and united kingdom pound sterling 
when the dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of foreign currency denominated revenue decreases  when the dollar weakens  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated revenue increases 
the company invoices its international distributors based on an agreed transfer price per unit in united states dollars  which is subject to revision upon quarterly reconciliations based on contractual formulas 
final pricing for product shipments to international distributors is subject to contractual formulas based on the distributor s net realized price in the local currency to its customers 
the company recognizes additional revenue  if any  or reductions to the transfer price  upon finalization of pricing with its international distributors 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the dollar  may adversely affect our international revenue as expressed in dollars
