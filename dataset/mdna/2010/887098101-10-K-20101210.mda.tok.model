critical accounting policies and estimates the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified five policies  that as a result of judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights msrs  the determination of other than temporary impairments in the market value of investment securities  the determination of goodwill impairment and the determination of the recorded value of other real estate owned 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  generally describes the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
the allowance is based upon management s comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance for loan loss level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
while the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to significantly increase or decrease its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document 
although management believes the level of the allowance as of september  was adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  results of examinations by the company s or the bank s regulators or other factors  could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights msrs 
msrs are capitalized when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with servicing rights retained and are amortized to servicing income on loans sold in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the value of msrs at the date of the sale of loans is determined based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
the estimated fair value is evaluated at least annually by a third party firm for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time servicing assets were originated 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msrs portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msrs fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at different times 
otti other than temporary impairment in the estimated fair value of investment securities 
unrealized investment securities losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether declines in value should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition through earnings for the portion related to credit losses 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is less than the recorded value primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  when there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the recorded value primarily as a result of current market conditions and not a result of deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer or the underlying collateral in the case of mutual funds and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer  and recommendation of investment advisors or market analysts 
therefore  continued deterioration of current market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the company s investment portfolio 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is analyzed annually for impairment 
an annual test is performed during the third quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if the estimated fair value of the company s sole reporting unit exceeds the recorded value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary 
one of the circumstances evaluated when determining if an impairment test of goodwill is needed more frequently than annually is the extent and duration that the company s market capitalization total common shares outstanding multiplied by current stock price is less than the total equity applicable to common shareholders 
during the quarter ended june   the company engaged a third party firm to perform the annual test for goodwill impairment 
the test concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired 
as of september   there have been no events or changes in the circumstances that would indicate a potential impairment 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future 
other real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
other real estate owned and other repossessed assets consist of properties or assets acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure  and are recorded initially at the estimated fair value of the properties less estimated costs of disposal 
costs relating to development and improvement of the properties or assets are capitalized while costs relating to holding the properties or assets are expensed 
valuations are periodically performed by management  and a charge to earnings is recorded if the recorded valued of a property exceeds its estimated net realizable value

operating strategy the company is a bank holding company which operates primarily through its subsidiary  the bank 
the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
since the latter half of  depressed economic conditions have prevailed in portions of the united states  including washington state where we hold substantially all of our loans and conduct all of our operations 
the majority of our loans are secured by collateral and made to borrowers located in washington state 
western washington  which includes our primary market areas  has experienced home price declines  increased foreclosures  and has experienced above average unemployment rates 
in response to the financial challenges in our market areas we have taken actions to manage our capital  reduce our exposure to speculative construction and land development loans and maintain higher levels of on balance sheet liquidity 
we have continued in this low interest environment to originate residential fixed rate mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market 
we continue to manage the growth of our commercial and multi family real estate loan portfolios in a disciplined fashion while continuing to dispose of other real estate owned properties and grow retail deposits 
we believe the resolution of problem financial institutions and continued bank consolidation in western washington will provide opportunities for the company to increase market share within the communities it serves 
we are currently pursuing the following strategies improve asset quality 
we are focused on monitoring existing performing loans  resolving non performing assets and selling foreclosed assets 
we have sought to reduce the level of non performing assets through collections  write downs  modifications and sales of other real estate owned properties 
we have taken proactive steps to resolve our non performing loans  including negotiating payment plans  forbearances  loan modifications and loan extensions and accepting short payoffs on delinquent loans when such actions have been deemed appropriate 
expand our presence within our existing market areas by capturing opportunities resulting from changes in the competitive environment 
we currently conduct our business primarily in western washington 
we have a community bank strategy that emphasizes responsive and personalized service to our customers 
as a result of fdic bank resolutions and anticipated consolidation of banks in our market areas  we believe there is an opportunity for a community and customer focused bank to expand its customer base 
by offering timely decision making  delivering appropriate banking products and services  and providing customer access to our senior managers we believe community banks  such as timberland bank  can distinguish themselves from larger banks operating in our market areas 
we believe we have a significant opportunity to attract additional borrowers and depositors and expand our market presence and market share within our extensive branch footprint 
continue generating revenues through mortgage banking operations 
the substantial majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans we originate are sold into the secondary market with servicing retained 
this strategy produces gains on the sale of such loans and reduces the interest rate and credit risk associated with fixed rate residential lending 
we will continue to originate custom construction and owner builder loans for sale into the secondary market upon the completion of construction 
portfolio diversification 
we have strictly limited the origination of speculative construction  land development and land loans in favor of loans that possess credit profiles representing less risk to the bank 
we will continue originating owner builder and custom construction loans  multi family loans  commercial business loans and certain commercial real estate loans which offer higher risk adjusted returns  shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
we anticipate capturing more of each customer s banking relationship by cross selling our loan and deposit products and additional services to our customers 
increase core deposits and other retail deposit products 
we focus on establishing a total banking relationship with our customers with the intent of internally funding our loan portfolio 
we anticipate that the continued focus on customer relationships will help increase our level of core deposits and locally based retail certificates of deposit 
in addition to our retail branches we maintain technology based products such as business cash management and a business remote deposit product that enables us to compete effectively with banks of all sizes 
limit exposure to increasing interest rates 
for many years the majority of the loans the bank has retained in its portfolio have generally possessed periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention have included arm loans  short term construction loans  and to a lesser extent commercial business loans with interest rates tied to a market index such as the prime rate 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale into the secondary market 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market  and retaining the related mortgage servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by fimac solutions  llc fimac  a company that specializes in providing the financial services industry interest risk rate risk and balance sheet management services 
based on a rate shock analysis prepared by fimac based on data at september   an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income by approximately  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income by approximately  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
see quantitative aspects of market risk below for additional information 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than seven years generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans constituted million or  of the bank s total mortgage loan portfolio due after one year 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the model provided for the bank by fimac estimates the changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by fimac based on data at september  net interest income current market value hypothetical interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base basis points dollars in thousands     base    does not include loan fees 
includes boli income  which is included in non interest income on the consolidated financial statements 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a increase in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a increase in npv and a increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in net interest income in a rising rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in increases in npv when rates increase by basis points or less and a decrease in npv when rates decrease by basis points or less 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  the company s total assets increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term certificates of deposit cds held for investment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net loans receivable 
net loans receivable decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the reduction in the loan portfolio was primarily due to a significant decrease in construction and land development loan balances during the year ended september   which was partially offset by increases in commercial real estate loan balances  one to four family loan balances  multi family loan balances and commercial business loan balances 
total deposits increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result of increases in now checking account balances and cd account balances 
shareholders equity decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was primarily due to a net loss for the year ended september   which was partially offset by a reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity component  due to a reduction in unrealized losses on investment securities 
the company remains well capitalized with a total risk based capital ratio of at september  a more detailed explanation of the changes in significant balance sheet categories follows cash and cash equivalents and cds held for investment cash and cash equivalents and cds held for investment increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in cash equivalents and short term cds was primarily due to the company s decision to increase its liquidity position for regulatory and asset liability management purposes 
mortgage backed securities and other investments mortgage backed securities and other investments decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was primarily as a result of regular amortization and prepayments on mortgage backed securities and otti charges recorded on private label residential mortgage backed securities 
the securities on which the otti charges were recognized were acquired from the in kind redemption of the company s investment in the amf family of mutual funds in june for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see item  business investment activities and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  decreased by million or to million at september  from million at september  the decrease in the portfolio was primarily a result of a million decrease in construction and land development loan balances net of the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process  a million decrease in consumer loan balances and a million decrease in land loan balances 
these decreases to net loans receivable were partially offset by a million increase in commercial real estate loan balances  a million increase in one to four family loan balances  a million increase multi family loan balances and a million increase in commercial business loan balances 
the decreases in the construction and land development loan balances were primarily due to loan payoffs  construction projects being completed and converted to permanent financing  loan charge offs and changes in the company s underwriting standards for these types of loans  which has decreased the level of construction and land development loan originations 
loan originations decreased by to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a decrease in the demand for single family home loan refinances 
the company continued to sell longer term fixed rate loans for asset liability management purposes and to generate non interest income 
the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans during the year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  for additional information on loans  see item  business lending activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
premises and equipment premises and equipment decreased by  or  to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was primarily as a result of depreciation 
for additional information on premises and equipment  see item  properties and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
oreo oreo and other repossessed assets increased by million  or to million at september  from million at september  as a result of additional properties being acquired through the loan foreclosure process 
at september   the balance was comprised of individual properties and three other repossessed assets 
the oreo properties consisted of two condominium projects totaling million  three land development projects totaling million  eight single family homes totaling million  land parcels totaling million and three commercial real estate properties totaling million 
the largest oreo property was a condominium project with a balance of million 
for additional information on oreo  see item  business lending activities nonperforming assets and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
goodwill and core deposit intangible cdi the recorded value of goodwill at million at september  remained unchanged from september  the amortized value of cdi decreased by  to  at september  from  at september  due to scheduled amortization 
the company recorded goodwill and cdi in connection with an acquisition of seven branches and related deposits in october the company performed its annual review of goodwill during the quarter ended june  and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill 
for additional information of goodwill and cdi  see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
mortgage servicing rights msrs msrs decreased  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to an  msr valuation allowance established during the year ended september  the establishment of a valuation allowance was primarily a result of lower mortgage interest rates at september  which reduced the expected duration of the cash flows associated with the msr portfolio  and therefore reduced the estimated fair value of the msrs 
prepaid fdic insurance assessment the prepaid fdic insurance assessment increased to million at september  due to the fdic s new requirement to prepay three year s worth of estimated insurance fees on december  deposits deposits increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily a result of a million increase in now checking account balances  a million increase in cd account balances  an million increase in savings account balances and an million increase in non interest bearing account balances 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in money market account balances 
the increase in now account balances was primarily a result of the company s checking account promotions 
the increase in cd account balances was primarily a result of increased demand for cd accounts by customers in the company s market areas 
the company also experienced deposit inflows due to a number of customers transferring funds from other financial institutions during the year ended september  for additional information on deposits  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds and note of the consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
fhlb advances and frb borrowings fhlb advances and frb borrowings decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  as the company used a portion of its liquid assets to repay maturing fhlb advances and frb borrowings 
for additional information on borrowings  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds borrowings and notes of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was primarily due to a net loss of million and the payment and accrual of million in dividends to preferred and common shareholders and was partially offset by a million reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity component  due to a reduction in unrealized losses on investment securities 
the frb has denied the company s request to pay cash dividends on its outstanding series a preferred stock held by the treasury for the payments due may  and august  cash dividends on the series a preferred stock are cumulative and accrue and compound on each subsequent date 
accordingly  during the deferral period  the company will continue to accrue  and reflect in the consolidated financial statements  the deferred dividends on the outstanding series a preferred stock 
as a result of not receiving permission from the frb  the company had not made the may  or the august  dividend payment as of september  at september   the company had unpaid preferred stock dividends in arrears of  if the company does not make six quarterly dividend payments on the series a preferred stock  whether or not consecutive  the treasury will have the right to appoint two directors to the company s board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
in addition  the company s ability to pay dividends with respect to common stock is restricted until the dividend obligations under the series a preferred stock are brought current 
for additional information on shareholders equity  see the consolidated statements of shareholders equity contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended september  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended september  net loss to common shareholders after adjusting for preferred stock dividends and preferred stock discount accretion was million for the year ended september  compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ended september  the increased loss was primarily due to increased non interest expenses and decreased non interest income  which were partially offset by increased net interest income  a decreased provision for loan losses and an increased benefit for federal income taxes 
loss per diluted common share was for the year ended september   compared to a loss per diluted common share of for the year ended september  the increased non interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in fdic insurance expense  an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense  an increase in oreo related expenses  an increase in the company s general liability insurance expense and increases in premises and equipment expenses 
the decrease in non interest income was primarily a result of a decrease in gain on sale of loans  a decrease in boli net earnings and an msr valuation allowance 
these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the otti loss on mortgage backed securities 
a more detailed explanation of the statement of operations categories is presented below 
net loss the net loss for the year ended september  increased by million to million from  for the year ended september  net loss to common shareholders after adjusting for preferred stock dividends and preferred stock discount accretion was million or per diluted common share for the year ended september   compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the year ended september  the increase in loss per diluted common share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in non interest expense  a million  net of income tax per diluted common share decrease in non interest income and a  increase in preferred stock dividends and preferred stock discount accretion which increased the net loss to common shareholders by approximately per diluted common share 
changes to the benefit for income taxes due to a decrease in the amount of dividend deductions and adjustments to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance also increased the loss per diluted common share by approximately per diluted common share 
these increases to the loss per diluted common share were partially offset by a   net of income tax per diluted common share increase in net interest income and a   net of income tax per diluted common share decrease in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income net interest income increased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increased average level of interest earning assets which was partially offset by margin compression due to an increased level of relatively low yielding cash equivalents and other liquid assets 
total interest and dividend income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earning assets decreased to from 
the decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets was primarily a result of an increase in the amount of lower yielding cash equivalents and other liquid assets and a change in the composition of the loan portfolio as the level of higher yielding construction and land development loans decreased 
total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the decrease in funding costs was primarily a result of a decrease in overall market rates and a decrease in the level of average fhlb advances 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earning assets decreased at a greater rate than the funding costs decreased 
the margin compression was primarily due to an increased level of liquid assets with lower yields and the reversal of interest income on loans placed on non accrual status during the year ended september  the reversal of interest income on loans placed on non accrual status during the year ended september  reduced the net interest margin by approximately basis points 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the small decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily a result of a decrease in the level of non performing loans and a decrease in the bank s construction and land development loan balances 
the company had net charge offs of million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of million for the year ended september  the net charge off total for the year ended september  included million in impairments that were identified and specifically provisioned for in the previous fiscal year 
the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the company has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the company performs an analysis that considers pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of impaired loans  and other factors to determine an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses 
management s analysis for the years ended september  and  placed a greater emphasis on the company s construction and land development portfolio and the effect of various factors such as geographic and loan type concentrations 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and loans held for sale and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
impaired loans are subject to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan 
the aggregate principal impairment amount determined at september  was  while the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily a result of a million decrease in gain on sale of loans  an  valuation allowance on mortgage servicing rights  and a  decrease in boli net earnings 
also impacting the comparison between the years was  in non recurring income recorded during the year ended september  for property easements sold 
these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a million decrease in net otti losses recorded and a  increase in atm transaction fees 
the decreased income from loan sales was primarily a result of a decrease in the amount of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market for the year ended september  the sale of one to four family mortgage loans totaled million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the higher loan sales during the year ended september  was primarily due to increased refinance activity that was attributable to decreased interest rates for fixed rate mortgage loans 
the  valuation allowance on the company s mortgage servicing rights was primarily the result of lower mortgage interest rates at september  relative to september  the lower interest rates reduced the market value of the company s mortgage servicing rights by reducing the expected duration of the cash flows associated with the asset 
the higher boli income for the year ended september  was primarily due to a  gain on a boli death claim benefit and a  non recurring gain associated with transferring a portion of the boli portfolio to a new insurance company during the year ended september  the company s net otti loss on mortgage backed securities decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the otti charges for both years were on private label mortgage backed securities that were acquired from an in kind redemption from the amf family of mutual funds in june at september   the company s remaining private label mortgage backed securities had been reduced to million from an original acquired balance of million 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to an  increase in fdic insurance expense  a  increase in the company s general liability insurance expense which is included in the other non interest expense category  a  increase in salaries and employee benefit expense  a  increase in oreo related expenses and a  increase in premises and equipment expense 
the increase in fdic insurance expense was primarily due to increased assessments rates and a non recurring accrual adjustment which increased the expense by  for the year ended september  the increase in general liability insurance expense was primarily due to increased insurance costs for financial institutions in this economic cycle 
the increase in salaries and employee benefit expense was primarily a result of a decreased level of loan originations 
under gaap  the portion of a loan origination fee that is attributable to the estimated employee costs to generate the loan is recorded as a reduction of salaries and employee benefit expense 
with the decrease in loan originations  the loan origination fees that reduced salaries and employee benefit expense decreased by  during the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  the increase in oreo related expenses was primarily a result of valuation write downs based on updated appraisals received for several properties 
the increase in premises and equipment expense for the current fiscal year was primarily the result of a capital gain on the sale of company owned property that reduced premises and equipment expenses by  for the year ended september  the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  benefit for federal income taxes the benefit for federal income taxes increased by  to million for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  primarily as a result of an increased loss before income taxes 
the company s effective federal income tax benefit rate was for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  the change in the effective tax benefit rate is primarily due to changes in the percentage of non taxable income and changes to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance 
the benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was increased by a higher level of non taxable income  primarily due to an increase in boli net earnings 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended september  was also increased by approximately  due to adjustments made to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance for a previous non deductible capital loss carry forward 
in periods with a loss before income taxes  the effective benefit rate is increased by non taxable income items and other adjustments that increase the tax benefit 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income decreased by million  or  to a net loss of  for the year ended september  from net income of million for the year ended september  income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the preferred stock dividend and the preferred stock discount accretion was a loss of million for the year ended september  compared to income of million available to common shareholders for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily as a result of increased provision for loan losses  decreased net interest income  and increased non interest expenses  which were partially offset by increased non interest income 
diluted earnings per common share decreased by to a loss of for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in net charge offs  an increase in impaired loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  and uncertainties in real estate values in the pacific northwest 
net charge offs totaled million during the year ended september   which was equivalent to of the average outstanding loans 
the decreased net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in non accrual loans and lower overall market interest rates  which compressed the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased non interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in fdic insurance expense  an increase in oreo related expenses  an increase in loan monitoring and foreclosure related expenses and increases in premises and equipment expenses 
the increased non interest income was primarily a result of increased gains on sale of loans  increased service charges on deposit accounts and increased boli net earnings partially offset by net otti losses on private label mortgage backed securities 
the increased income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar amount of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market for the year ended september  the increase in loan sales was primarily attributable to lower interest rates for year fixed rate loans which increased refinancing activity 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  decreased by million  or  to a net loss of  from net income of million for the year ended september  income available to common shareholders after adjusting for preferred stock dividends and preferred stock discount accretion was a loss of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended september  the decrease in diluted earnings per common share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in the provision for loan losses  a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in non interest expense  a million million net of income tax per diluted common share decrease in net interest income and a  increase in preferred stock dividends and preferred stock accretion which decreased earnings by approximately per diluted common share 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in non interest income which increased diluted earnings per common share by approximately 
net interest income net interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in non accrual loans and lower overall market interest rates 
total interest and dividend income decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earning assets decreased to from 
total average interest earning assets including non accrual loans increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  non accrual loans increased by million to million at september  from million at september  total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest bearing liabilities increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earnings assets decreased at a greater rate than funding costs decreased 
this was primarily a result of the decreasing interest rate environment which reduced yields on loans at a faster pace than the bank was able to reduce deposit and borrowing costs 
the reversal of interest income on loans placed on non accrual status contributed to the margin compression and reduced the net interest margin by approximately basis points for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in net charge offs  an increase in impaired loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the company s loan grading system  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
the company had net charge offs of million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of  for the year ended september  the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  non interest income total non interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of a million decrease in loss on the redemption of mutual funds  million increase in gain on sale of loans  an  increase in service charges on deposit accounts  a  increase in boli net earnings and  in income recorded for property easements sold 
these increases to non interest income were partially offset by a million increase in net otti losses recorded during the year ended september  the million loss on mutual funds recorded during the year ended september  was a result of the redemption of investments in the amf family of mutual funds for the underlying securities and cash 
the net otti charges of million recorded during the year ended september  were on private label mortgage backed securities that were acquired from the in kind redemption from the amf family of mutual funds in the increased income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar amount of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market for the year ended september  the sale of one to four family mortgage loans totaled million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in loan sales was primarily attributable to lower interest rates for year fixed rate loans which increased refinancing activity

non interest expense total non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in fdic insurance expense including a special fdic assessment of  a  increase in oreo related expenses  a  increase in loan monitoring and foreclosure related expenses which are included in the other non interest expense category  a  increase in premises and equipment expense  a  increase in salary and benefit expenses  and a  increase in deposit related expenses which are included in the other non interest expense category 
the increase in oreo related expenses and foreclosure expenses were primarily a result of an increase in the number of oreo properties held and an increase in foreclosure activity 
the increase in premises and equipment expenses was partially attributable to the addition of a full service branch facility in chehalis  washington 
also contributing to the change in premises and equipment expense was an insurance settlement and the sale of a building in the prior fiscal year which reduced premises and equipments expenses by a combined  for the year ended september  the company also recorded a capital gain on the sale of company owned property which reduced premises and equipment expenses by  for the year ended september  the increased salary and benefit expenses were primarily a result of annual salary adjustments and increased insurance expenses

the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision benefit for federal income taxes the provision for federal income taxes decreased by million to a net benefit of  for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes 
the benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was impacted by an increased level of non taxable income  primarily attributable to the increase in boli net earnings 
the income tax benefit for the year ended september  was also increased by approximately  due to adjustments made to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance for a previous non deductible capital loss carry forward 
the provision for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was impacted by the million loss on the redemption of mutual funds 
the redemption of the mutual funds resulted in a capital loss which can only be deducted for tax purposes to the extent that capital gains are realized within a three year carry back period and a five year carry forward period 
the company estimated that it would have  in capital gains during the allowable tax period to offset the capital loss 
therefore million of the million loss was treated as non deductible for tax purposes for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate was or exclusive of the mutual fund redemption loss and associated tax impact for the year ended september  average balances  interest and average yields cost the earnings of the company depend largely on the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative amount of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liability portfolios

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while the maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at september   the bank s regulatory liquidity ratio net cash  and short term and marketable assets  as a percentage of net deposits and short term liabilities was

the bank also maintains a short tem borrowing line with the federal reserve bank with total credit based on eligible collateral 
at september  the bank had no outstanding balance on this borrowing line 
liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the bank s management 
the bank adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  and iv yields available on interest bearing deposits 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb  pcbb and collateral for repurchase agreements

the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
