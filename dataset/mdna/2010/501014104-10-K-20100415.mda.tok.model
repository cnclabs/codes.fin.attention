in addition  the improvement in same store sales reflects generally lower use of couponing and other price promotions in fiscal  as well as generally lower values of coupons and other price promotions 
the company is implementing programs designed to improve on premises sales  including increased focus on local store marketing efforts  improved employee training  store refurbishment efforts and the introduction of new products 
off premises sales sales to grocers and mass merchants in fiscal include approximately million of off premises sales of four stores in eastern canada that the company refranchised in december exclusive of the sales of the canadian stores that were refranchised  sales to grocers and mass merchants decreased slightly to million  with the decline in the average number of doors served offset by a increase in the average weekly sales per door 
convenience store sales fell due to both a decline in the average number of doors served and in the average weekly sales per door 
among other reasons  sales to convenience stores have declined as a result of several large customers implementing in house doughnut programs to replace the company s products 
declines in the average weekly sales per door adversely affect profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
the company is implementing strategies to increase sales  increase average per door sales and reduce costs in the off premises channel 
these strategies include improved route management and route consolidation including elimination of or reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors  new sales incentives and performance based pay programs  increased emphasis on relatively longer shelf life products and has developed order management systems to more closely match display quantities and assortments with consumer demand 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenues improved by percentage points from fiscal  falling to of revenues in fiscal lower costs for doughnut mix and shortening drove the improvement 
lower costs of flour and shortening resulting from lower agricultural commodity costs enabled kk supply chain to reduce prices on these key items in fiscal while the cost of doughnut mix and other ingredients has been relatively stable during fiscal  company stores cost of sugar rose approximately in the fourth quarter and an additional in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of price increases resulting from the expiration of a favorable kk supply chain sugar supply contract 
the company currently estimates that the overall increase in the cost of materials and ingredients in fiscal will be approximately million  or approximately of sales 
the company is implementing programs intended to improve store operations and reduce costs as a percentage of revenues  including improved employee training and the introduction of food and labor cost management tools 
improved route management and the implementation of performance based pay programs in the off premises channel drove a percentage point decrease in delivery labor as a percentage of off premises sales in fiscal compared to fiscal vehicle costs as a percentage of revenues improved percentage points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal lower fuel prices and improved route management and route consolidation drove the improvement in vehicle costs 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  but maintains stop loss coverage for individual claims exceeding certain amounts 
the company provides for claims under these self insured programs using actuarial methods as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and updates actuarial valuations of its self insurance reserves at least annually 
such periodic actuarial valuations result in changes over time in the estimated amounts which ultimately will be paid for claims under these programs to reflect the company s actual claims experience for each policy year as well as trends in claims experience over multiple years 
such claims  particularly workers compensation claims  often are paid over a number of years following the year in which the insured events occur  and the estimated ultimate cost of each year s claims accordingly is adjusted over time as additional information becomes available 
the company recorded favorable adjustments to its self insurance claims liabilities related to prior policy years of approximately million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter and million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims and is included in employee benefits in the table above   relates to vehicle liability claims and is included in vehicle costs in the table above and  relates to general liability claims and is included in other operating expenses in the table above 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims and  relates to general liability claims 
during fiscal  the company stores segment recorded charges totaling million of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter for the settlement of environmental and wage hour litigation  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company stores segment closed or refranchised a total of stores in the last two fiscal years  none of which have been accounted for as discontinued operations because the company continues to have significant continuing involvement in the markets in which the stores were or are located  through either continuing operations of other stores in or serving the market or through its relationship as a franchisor

domestic franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new domestic franchisees  to assist in domestic store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of domestic franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
domestic franchise operating expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased resources devoted to the development and support of domestic franchisees  higher incentive compensation provisions of approximately  and an increase in bad debt provisions to approximately  related principally to a single domestic franchisee 
additionally  during fiscal  the company recorded charges of approximately  to the domestic franchise segment for the settlement of litigation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein

 in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees   other total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   allocated corporate overhead  total operating expenses   segment operating income   international franchise royalties declined  driven by a decrease in sales by international franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business reduced sales by international franchisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which adversely affected international royalty revenues by approximately  additionally  the company did not recognize as revenue approximately  and  of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal and  respectively  because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects the large number of new stores opened internationally over the past two years  the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets  and the overall softness in global economic conditions  particularly in more developed markets 
international franchisees opened stores in the past three fiscal years  including stores in markets in which there were no international franchise stores at the end of fiscal of the openings over the past three years  stores have been open at least weeks and are included in the same store sales computation for fiscal many of these new stores experienced very high sales in their initial year or more of operation  and their average weekly sales are declining to more sustainable levels 
international development and franchise fees decreased  in fiscal due to fewer store openings by international franchisees in fiscal than in fiscal international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses rose in the fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased resources devoted to the development and support of franchisees outside the united states and to higher incentive compensation provisions of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the bad debt provision to  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows

the decline also reflects selling price reductions for doughnut mixes and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in fiscal in order to pass along to company and franchise stores reductions in kk supply chain s cost of flour and shortening 
finally  in fiscal  the company utilized a fuel surcharge program to recoup additional freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs 
charges under the program were based upon the price of diesel fuel  the price benchmark was reset in fiscal and no fuel surcharges were made under the program in fiscal an increasing percentage of franchise store sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
many of the ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
accordingly  kk supply chain revenues are less correlated with sales by international franchisees than with sales by domestic franchisees 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues fell in fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease was the reduced selling price of doughnut mix in fiscal resulting principally from lower flour costs 
while the selling prices of doughnut mixes in fiscal were lower than in fiscal as a result of lower raw materials costs  overall gross margins widened because the company attempts to maintain the gross profit on sales of doughnut mixes relatively constant on a per unit basis 
lower inbound freight costs reflect a decrease in freight rates resulting from lower fuel prices 
in addition  the company closed its california distribution center in fiscal and engaged an independent contractor to supply company and franchise stores west of the mississippi  the inbound freight cost associated with goods delivered by the contractor is reflected in the fee paid to the contractor  which is included in other distribution costs 
outbound freight costs fell in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting both lower unit sales volumes and reduced costs resulting from lower fuel prices 
in addition  outbound freight in fiscal includes a charge of approximately million approximately of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales elimination related to payments made by the company to its former third party freight consolidator which were improperly not remitted to the freight carriers by the freight consolidator 
the actions of the third party freight consolidator  which filed for bankruptcy protection  resulted in a loss to the company which the company has not recovered 
other segment operating costs include segment management  purchasing  customer service and support  laboratory and quality control costs and research and development expenses 
these costs include a net credit of approximately  for bad debt expense in fiscal and a net credit of approximately  in fiscal the net credits principally reflect sustained improved payment performance and or reduced credit exposure with respect to a small number of franchisees and  in fiscal  a recovery of receivables previously written off 
net credits in bad debt expense should not be expected to occur on a regular basis 
as of january   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts from affiliate and unaffiliated franchisees totaled approximately million 
domestic and international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal the majority of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal include approximately million of incentive compensation provisions to reflect fiscal results with an additional charge of approximately million included in direct operating expenses  there were no incentive compensation provisions in general and administrative expenses for fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflect higher legal costs compared to fiscal  including legal fees of approximately million related to the resolved environmental litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
general and administrative expenses include professional fees and other costs  together with related insurance recoveries  associated with certain securities litigation and related investigations  including costs arising from the company s obligation to indemnify certain former officers of the company for costs incurred by them in connection with those matters 
those matters are described under other litigation federal securities class actions and shareholder derivative actions and settlement thereof in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
those costs and expenses were a net credit of approximately million in fiscal and a charge of approximately million in fiscal the net credit in fiscal reflects insurance reimbursements of approximately million of costs incurred in prior periods in connection with such litigation and investigations  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
all matters with respect to this litigation have been resolved  and the company does not anticipate that these expenses will be incurred going forward 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal impairment charges related to long lived assets totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal  of which approximately million and  respectively  related principally to underperforming stores 
the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing decisions  the effects of changing costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
when the company concludes that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable based on future projected undiscounted cash flows  the company records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets  substantially all of which were real properties  the fair values of these assets were estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  on independent appraisals and  in the case of properties which the company currently is negotiating to sell  based on the company s negotiations with unrelated third party buyers 
the charges relate to stores closed  refranchised or expected to be closed  as well as charges with respect to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
in addition to the foregoing  impairment charges for fiscal reflect a one time cash recovery of  from the bankruptcy estate of freedom rings  llc  a former subsidiary of the company which filed for bankruptcy in fiscal  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
lease termination costs represent the estimated fair value of liabilities related to unexpired leases  after reduction by the amount of accrued rent expense  if any  related to the leases  and are recorded when the lease contracts are terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
the fair value of these liabilities were estimated as the excess  if any  of the contractual payments required under the unexpired leases over the current market lease rates for the properties  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate over the remaining term of the leases 
in fiscal  the company recorded lease termination charges related to closed stores of approximately million  compared to a net credit related to lease terminations of  in fiscal the charges in fiscal relate principally to terminations of two leases having rental rates substantially above current market levels 
in fiscal  changes in estimated sublease rentals on a closed store that was subsequently refranchised and the realization of proceeds on an assignment of another closed store lease resulted in a credit in the lease termination provision 
this credit  along with the reversal of previously recorded accrued rent associated with stores closed  partially offset by charges related to other closed store leases  resulted in a net credit in the provision for lease termination costs in fiscal the company intends to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
in fiscal  the company refranchised three operating company stores to a new franchisee  as more fully described under basis of consolidation in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and a fourth operating store to an existing franchisee 
no gain or loss was recorded on the former transaction  while the second transaction resulted in an asset impairment charge of  as well as receipt of cash proceeds of million  representing the proceeds of the sale of the store 
in fiscal  the company refranchised one idled store acquired by the company from a failed franchisee  refranchised two domestic operating stores to a new franchisee  and refranchised the four company stores in eastern canada to a new franchisee 
the company received no proceeds in connection with any of these transactions 
with the exception of a non cash pretax gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to foreign currency translation arising from the canadian disposal which is included in non operating income and expense  no significant gain or loss was recognized as a result of these refranchisings 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any additional stores or markets or the amount of proceeds  if any  which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreements 
refranchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets

the company provides for claims under these self insured programs using actuarial methods as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and updates actuarial valuations of its self insurance reserves at least annually 
such periodic actuarial valuations result in changes over time in the estimated amounts which ultimately will be paid for claims under these programs to reflect the company s actual claims experience for each policy year as well as trends in claims experience over multiple years 
such claims  particularly workers compensation claims  often are paid over a number of years following the year in which the insured events occur  and the estimated ultimate cost of each year s claims accordingly is adjusted over time as additional information becomes available

international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects the large number of new stores opened internationally in fiscal and fiscal  the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets and the effects of soft economic conditions 
international development and franchise fees increased  in fiscal due to an increase in store openings compared to fiscal development and franchise fees did not increase proportionately with the number of store openings principally because a greater percentage of fiscal openings were satellite stores compared to fiscal  development and franchise fees per store are lower for satellite stores than for factory stores 
international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses rose in the fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in international franchise operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a bad debt provision of approximately million principally related to credit exposure on international franchisees  partially offset by lower store opening support expenses

in addition  an increasing percentage of franchisee sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
many of the ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
the decline in the kk supply chain revenue due to lower unit volume was partially offset by an increase in revenue resulting from price increases for mixes and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in fiscal in order to offset increases in the cost of materials 
the kk supply chain revenue decrease was also attributable to a decrease in sales of equipment and equipment services in fiscal compared to fiscal franchisee expansion in fiscal was comprised principally of satellite stores  which require less equipment than do factory stores 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the cost of raw materials used in the production of doughnut mix and of other goods sold to company and franchise stores was higher in fiscal than in fiscal in particular  the prices of flour and shortening and the products from which they are made were significantly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  kk supply chain increased the prices charged to company and franchise stores for doughnut mixes  shortening and other goods in order to mitigate increases in the cost of these raw materials 
however  while kk supply chain increased prices to cover its increased costs  profit margins as a percentage of sales decreased 
in addition  cost of sales was adversely affected by higher inbound freight costs resulting from higher fuel prices 
outbound freight costs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant component of the increase was a charge of approximately million approximately of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales elimination related to payments made by the company to its former third party freight consolidator which were improperly not remitted to the freight carriers by the freight consolidator 
for many years  the company utilized a third party freight consolidator to review and pay freight bills on behalf of the company 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company made routine payments to the third party freight consolidator which were improperly not remitted to the freight carriers 
the actions of the third party freight consolidator  which has since filed for bankruptcy protection  resulted in a loss to the company which the company currently has not recovered 
other segment operating costs include segment management  purchasing  customer service and support  laboratory and quality control costs and research and development expenses 
these costs include a net credit of approximately  for bad debts expense in fiscal compared to a charge of approximately million in fiscal the net credit in fiscal reflects a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts resulting principally from a decrease in credit exposure with respect to certain franchisees and a recovery of certain receivables previously reserved  partially offset by bad debt provisions recorded with respect to other franchise receivables 
as of february   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts from franchisees totaled approximately million

the company closed six stores in fiscal and nine stores in fiscal the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing decisions  the effects of changing costs including commodity costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process

the fair value of these liabilities were estimated as the excess  if any  of the contractual payments required under the unexpired leases over the current market lease rates for the properties  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate over the remaining term of the leases 
in fiscal  changes in estimated sublease rentals on a closed store that was subsequently refranchised and the realization of proceeds on an assignment of another closed store lease resulted in million of credits to the provision for lease termination costs

also in fiscal  the company prepaid approximately million of the new term loan  of which million was from the proceeds of sales of certain property and equipment and million represented discretionary prepayments 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 
debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in the last three fiscal years  management focused on reducing or eliminating the company s investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisees obligations  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to maintain credit availability to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring initiatives 
the secured credit facilities described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein are the company s principal source of external financing 
these facilities consist of a term loan having an outstanding principal balance of million as of january  which matures in february  and a million revolving credit facility maturing in february the secured credit facilities contain significant financial covenants 
based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can comply with the financial covenants and that the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in the secured credit facilities  or the occurrence or failure to occur of certain events  would cause the company to default under the facilities 
the company would attempt to negotiate waivers of any such default  should one occur 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to negotiate any such waivers  and the costs or conditions associated with any such waivers could be significant 
in the absence of a waiver of  or forbearance with respect to  any such default  the company s lenders would be able to exercise their rights under the credit agreement including  but not limited to  accelerating maturity of outstanding indebtedness and asserting their rights with respect to the collateral 
acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness under the secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the event that credit under the secured credit facilities were not available to the company  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of credit would be available to the company or  if they are available  under what terms or at what cost 
the operation of the financial covenants described above could limit the amount the company may borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the revolving facility is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit  which totaled approximately million as of january   the substantial majority of which secure the company s reimbursement obligations to insurers under the company s self insurance arrangements 
the maximum additional borrowing available to the company as of january  was approximately million 
the secured credit facilities also contain customary events of default including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other indebtedness in excess of million  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults in excess of million and the occurrence of a change of control 
leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of two to years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist principally of the company s guarantees of indebtedness of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
contractual cash obligations at january  the company s contractual cash obligations as of january  are as follows payments due in less more than than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities    interest payment obligations     payment obligations on interest rate hedge capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations    contingent guarantee obligations   other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims      k mirror plan liability total      estimated interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of january  amounts represent of the company s aggregate exposure at january  under loan guarantees related to franchisees in which the company has an ownership interest 
the preceding table of contractual cash obligations excludes income tax liabilities of approximately  as of january  for unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty in predicting the timing of any such related payments 
capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other general corporate purposes opening new company stores in selected markets  principally small retail shops remodeling and relocation of selected older company shops investing in equipment to support the off premises distribution channel maintaining and enhancing the supply chain manufacturing and distribution capabilities investing in systems and technology the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
the amount of these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and other infrastructure needs 
these capital outlays are subject to limitations contained in the secured credit facilities 
the company currently estimates that its capital expenditures for fiscal will be in the range of from million to million 
the most significant capital expenditures currently planned for fiscal are between seven and ten new satellite stores  refurbishments to existing stores  new point of sale hardware to replace existing hardware that is approaching the end of its useful life  and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures 
the company plans to fund these expenditures using cash provided by operations and current cash resources 
recent financial performance and business conditions the company experienced a decline in revenues and incurred net losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
the revenue decline reflects fewer company stores in operation resulting principally from the closure of lower performing locations  a decrease in off premises sales at company stores  a decline in domestic royalty revenues and lower sales of mixes and other ingredients resulting from lower sales by the company s domestic franchisees 
lower revenues have adversely affected operating margins because of the fixed or semi fixed nature of many of the company s direct operating expenses 
in addition  the prices of certain agricultural commodities and of oil  while volatile  have trended upward in the last fiscal three years  which has adversely affected the cost of the company s principal ingredients and increased the cost of gasoline consumed by the company 
sales volumes and changes in the cost of major ingredients and fuel can have a material effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  royalty revenues and most of kk supply chain revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and the company has reduced its aggregate outstanding debt by million over the past three fiscal years  using both cash generated from the sale of excess assets and cash generated by operations 
the company s credit facilities described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein are the company s principal source of external financing 
these facilities consist of a term loan having an outstanding principal balance of million as of january  which matures in february  and a million revolving credit facility maturing in february the credit facilities contain significant financial covenants  which also are described in note based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can comply with the these financial covenants and that the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
inflation the company does not believe that general price inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  prices of agricultural commodities and fuel have been volatile in recent years 
those price changes  which have generally trended upward  have had a significant effect on the cost of flour  shortening and sugar  the three most significant ingredients used in the production of the company s products  as well as on the cost of gasoline consumed by the company s off premises delivery fleet 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during the three fiscal years in the period ended january   some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this guidance requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves comparing the fair value of such assets with their carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value recorded as an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the discounted cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
the company also considers the estimated fair values of its reporting units relative to the company s overall market capitalization in connection with its goodwill impairment assessment 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  operating results and the balances of goodwill could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment analyses of goodwill resulted in impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal there were no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal or fiscal as of january   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million  all of which was associated with the domestic and international franchise segments  each of which consists of a single reporting unit 
the risk of goodwill impairment would increase in the event that the franchise segment operating results were to significantly deteriorate or the overall market capitalization of the company were to decline below the book value of the company s shareholders equity 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in addition  the sale of assets whose carrying value has been reduced by impairment charges could result in the recognition of gains or losses to the extent the sales proceeds realized differ from the reduced carrying amount of the assets 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for the estimated cost of claims on an undiscounted basis  without regard to the effects of stop loss coverage  using actuarial methods which evaluate known open and incurred but not reported claims and consider historical loss development experience 
in addition  the company records receivables from the insurance carriers for claims amounts estimated to be recovered under the stop loss insurance policies when these amounts are estimable and probable of collection 
the company estimates such stop loss receivables using the same actuarial methods used to establish the related claims accruals  and taking into account the amount of risk transferred to the carriers under the stop loss policies 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these loss accruals and related insurance receivables 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets in accordance with fasb guidance related to accounting for income taxes 
at january   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company  that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of certain loan obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records estimated liabilities for anticipated payments when the company believes that an obligation to perform under the guarantees is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
no liabilities for the guarantees were recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of january   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately million related to such loan guarantees 
the aggregate outstanding principal balance of loans subject to the company s guarantees was approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain equity method franchisees  the value of which cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
during the years ended january  and february   the company recorded impairment charges of  and  respectively  related to investments in and advances to equity method franchisees 
as of january   the company s investment in equity method franchisees was  stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share based payment awards based on their fair values 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
the fair value of stock options which contain market conditions as well as service conditions is estimated using monte carlo simulation techniques 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards which ultimately will vest  and periodically adjusts such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value  and techniques other than monte carlo simulation could be used to estimate the value of stock options which are subject to both service and market conditions 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued new disclosure standards about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standards are intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the company adopted the new standards prospectively as of february   accordingly  disclosures related to periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented 
adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for additional information about derivative financial instruments owned by the company 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted new accounting standards with respect to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on both a recurring and non recurring basis and with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted new accounting standards with respect to nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
adoption of these standards had no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for additional information regarding fair value measurements 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting standards with respect to subsequent events which establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the company adopted these standards  which did not represent a significant change from existing practice  during the quarter ended august  in june  the fasb issued amended accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the amended standards require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie based on whether the enterprise has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the amended standards require an ongoing reconsideration of the identity of the vie s primary beneficiary  if any  and provide a framework for the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
the amended standards are effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal adoption of the new standards will result in the company recognizing a divestiture of three stores that took place in a refranchising transaction in october  as described under basis of consolidation  to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
adoption of the standards will have no material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the fed funds rate or libor 
the interest cost of the company s debt may be affected by changes in these short term interest rates and increases in those rates may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
as of january   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in no increase in interest expense on the company s term debt due to the operation of an interest rate floor provision in the company s credit agreement 
the company s credit facilities and the related interest rate derivatives are described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
currency risk the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
the company s investment in its franchisee operating in mexico exposes the company to exchange rate risk 
in addition  although royalties from international franchisees are payable to the company in us dollars  those royalties are computed based on local currency sales  and changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies used in the countries in which the international franchisees operate affect the company s royalty revenues 
because royalty revenues are derived from a relatively large number of foreign countries  and royalty revenues are not highly concentrated in a small number of such countries  the company believes that the relatively small size of any currency hedging activities would adversely affect the economics of hedging strategies and  accordingly  the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
for the year ended january   the company s international franchisees had sales of approximately million  and the company s related royalty revenues were approximately million 
a hypothetical change in the average rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business would have a corresponding effect on the company s international royalty revenues of approximately million 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar and shortening are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one month s to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
other purchase arrangements typically are contractual arrangements with vendors for example  with respect to certain beverages and ingredients under which the company is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of goods  but must purchase minimum percentages of its requirements for such goods from these vendors with whom it has executed these contracts 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat and soybean oil 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient 
the company operates a large fleet of delivery vehicles and is exposed to the effects of changes in gasoline prices 
in fiscal  the company began periodically using futures and options on futures to hedge a portion of its exposure to rising gasoline prices

 although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that are subject to such contracts vary from time to time 
adverse changes in commodity prices could adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity 
sensitivity to price changes in agricultural commodities the following table illustrates the potential effect on the company s costs resulting from hypothetical changes in the cost of the company s three most significant ingredients
