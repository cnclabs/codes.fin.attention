overview we are the largest boating supply retailer in the world with net revenues of million and net income of million 
our business strategy is to offer an assortment of competitively priced merchandise for the boat and for the boater that meets the needs of individual boaters and boating businesses  provides great customer experiences and offers the convenience of multi channel shopping 
we believe that revenues were adversely affected during fiscal year by less than desired in stock levels 
we attribute this to a combination of factors 
the two most significant of these were higher demand than forecasted and poor fulfillment from a number of our key suppliers 
while we cannot quantify missed sales due to in stock issues  we do believe merchandise availability had a negative impact on us in  and we have taken  and will continue to take  a host of targeted steps to address this issue during we have increased our focus and investment in the total supply chain  and we believe we will be in a better position to react to changes in customer demand 
a few of the new or continuing key strategies we are implementing or building upon during include expanding our merchandise selection  including adding product assortment throughout all of our wide range of merchandise categories and accelerating development of west marine private label brands across a number of categories 
improving the on line experience for our customers with more and better content  improved search capabilities  faster speed and other new features 
providing outstanding product information and search capabilities by taking steps to better provide information that customers want and need through technology solutions and educational programs that help our customers and associates better access products and information 
continuing associate development  which will prioritize both product knowledge and management development with a focus on better planning  execution and supervisory skills 

table of contents we have three reportable segments stores  port supply  and direct sales 
our stores segment generated approximately of our net revenues 
our company operated stores open at the end of are located in states  puerto rico and canada 
in addition  we have two franchised stores in turkey 
our port supply segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors of marine equipment in the united states 
products shipped to port supply customers directly from our warehouses represented approximately of our net revenues 
our direct sales segment  which includes our internet and call center operations  offers customers around the world more than  products and it accounted for the remaining of our net revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense goodwill impairment store closures and other restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets income loss from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to net revenues of million for net revenues were unfavorably impacted by million due to an extra week in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year net income for was million 
this compares to a net loss for of million  which included a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs  a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and the impact of a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to an million  or  decrease in comparable store sales and a million decrease attributable to store closures in and partially offsetting these decreases was million of revenue from new stores opened in and the stores segment generated million of revenues in the first and extra week of fiscal  which negatively impacted comparisons year over year 
during fiscal  we experienced some favorable impacts on our business including continued improvement in boat usage  continued movement towards do it yourself projects  and favorable results from our product expansions and larger store formats 
we believe we have also benefited from changes in the competitive landscape  including the liquidation of one of our primary national competitors  and lower gas prices during peak boating season 
while recently we have seen increased boat usage in some markets  we expect consumers to continue to carefully evaluate their needs based boating purchases and continue to be very conservative with their spending on discretionary items 
during  we expect to open and close a small number of stores in connection with 
table of contents our real estate optimization strategy of evolving to having fewer  larger stores in many of our key markets 
as a result of these actions  we expect that our overall store counts will decline slightly  while our total selling square footage will remain stable or increase slightly 
in addition  we will continue with our practice of monitoring the operating performance and economics of all store locations and evaluating for closure any underperforming stores when the economics favor doing so 
port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to lower sales year over year to two customer types  boat dealers and boat builders 
we believe these customers were negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment and tight credit markets and we expect sales to these customers to stabilize during fiscal net revenues from our direct sales segment decreased million  or  to million  due to a decline in the international market year over year  at a much greater pace than domestic activity 
during fiscal  we do not expect total revenues from this segment to exceed revenues levels experienced last year 
we believe that ongoing weakness in the economy will continue to put downward pressure on our revenues  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow as our customer traffic and sales are most closely tied to boat usage  which is a discretionary spending item 
however  we also believe that we may continue to benefit from changes in the competitive landscape 
additionally  we expect some favorable impact on our business from continued movement to do it yourself projects and from our product expansions and larger store formats 
we have set conservative budgets for and will continue to focus on managing expenses and maximizing cash flow 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for the week period ended january  decreased by  or million  compared to the week period ended january  comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the geographic regions 
the decline in comparable store sales reflects lower sales of discretionary items  partially offset by increased sales of core boating parts and accessories 
while we have seen increased boat usage in some markets  we expect consumers to carefully evaluate their needs based boating purchases and to continue to be conservative with their spending on discretionary items 
we currently anticipate that our comparable store sales will stabilize and be relatively flat when compared to gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to lower sales 
however  gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a increase in product margin driven by more effective promotions  less clearance activity and a shift in revenues to higher margin core boating categories  such as maintenance 
additionally  inventory shrinkage improved by and buying and distribution costs leveraged by 
improvements were partially offset by the deleveraging of in occupancy expense 
occupancy is our largest fixed expense  and its impact on gross margin rate is largely driven by sales results and the fixed nature of the expense 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for and decreased as a percentage of revenues by to in  compared to in the decrease in sg a expense primarily was due to million in lower support and selling overhead expense  including a million reduction in costs related to the now settled 
table of contents sec investigation 
sg a was also lower by million for lower payroll  marketing and other variable expenses reflecting lower revenues 
decreased expenses associated with stores closed in resulted in a further reduction of million 
expenses also were lower by million due to favorable foreign currency translation gains compared to the fiscal year 
lower expenses were partially offset by million in higher accrued bonus expense reflecting performance above budgeted expectations and million in higher expense related to the additional week in fiscal store closure and other restructuring costs store closure and other restructuring costs for decreased by million compared to during  we recognized restructuring expenses of million consisting of million for store closures  million for port supply  million for closing a distribution center  million for repositioning the call center and million of severance costs for reductions in force at our watsonville  california support center 
also in  due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions  we increased reserves for lease contract termination obligations by million for stores closed as part of our restructuring plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sublease a location which had the largest associated termination obligation 
the terms of this particular agreement were more favorable than what we originally estimated and resulted in a million reversal in of the previously accrued estimated costs 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets expenses related to the impairment of long lived assets were less than million in fiscal  compared to million in the non cash charge primarily was attributable to the underperforming stores  of which have been closed 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in fiscal  compared to fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a provision of in the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the use of net operating losses under recently enacted federal legislation which allows companies to extend the carry back period from two to five years for periods beginning or ending in or  as well as our ability to use timing differences not previously benefited due to the valuation allowance 
the year over year difference also was due to management s decision in to increase the valuation allowance by million to bring it to a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to net revenues of million for net loss for was million  which included a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs  a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and the impact of a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this compares to a net loss for of million  which included a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill  million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and million non cash  pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
fiscal was a week fiscal period  and fiscal was a week period 

table of contents segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million  or  decrease in comparable store sales and an million decrease attributable to store closures in and partially offsetting the sales decreases was million of revenues from new stores opened in and port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased revenues to port supply customers through our store locations which are included in stores revenues 
across the port supply business stores and warehouse  we observed lower sales year over year to two customer types  boat dealers and boat builders 
we believe these customers were negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment and credit crisis 
net revenues from our direct sales segment decreased million  or  to million  due to decreased revenues from our call center channel 
the decrease from the call center channel was offset partially by increased internet revenues 
the decline in this segment was driven by lower domestic sales  partially offset by higher sales in some international markets 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for the week period ending january  decreased in by  or million  compared to the week period ending december  comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the decline in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of higher priced discretionary items and lower in store traffic levels throughout the year 
sales of usage based products  such as fishing and watersports equipment  declined at a rate greater than the overall comparable store trend  which we believe was indicative of reduced boating activity 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the country 
gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for gross profit decreased primarily due to lower sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  a decrease of compared to in gross profit was lower as a percentage of revenues by due to occupancy expense 
vendor allowances deleveraged  down  because of the reduced purchases for in line with lower sales and reduced inventory 
buying and distribution also contributed to the decline as a percentage of revenues  down 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for and increased as a percentage of revenues to in  a increase  compared to in the impact of expense controls implemented in  combined with lower variable expenses driven by lower revenues  resulted in a million decrease 
decreased expenses associated with stores closed in drove a further reduction of million 
expenses were also lower due to lower management bonuses with a year over year reduction of million in and million paid in fiscal to our former chief executive officer as severance compensation 
lower expenses were offset partially by million in unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments 
store closure and other restructuring costs in  we anticipated closing a small number of stores  which we originally estimated to be in the range of to locations 
these closures primarily were due to relocation  or consolidation of smaller stores into fewer  larger stores to better serve our markets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a more detailed 
table of contents analysis of store operations  particularly in light of deteriorating boating market conditions  and concluded that additional underperforming stores should be closed 
during the year  we closed stores spread across several major boating markets 
during the third quarter of  as part of our business restructuring effort  we decided to close our distribution center located in hagerstown  maryland  and our call center located in largo  florida 
we recognized restructuring expenses of million consisting of million for store closures  million for port supply  million for the distribution center  million for the call center and million of severance costs for reductions in force at our watsonville  california support center 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in the charge primarily was attributable to the impairment of stores 
the charge was attributable to the impairment of store and information technology assets 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in fiscal  compared to fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a provision of  compared to a benefit of in the change in our effective tax rate was due to management s decision to establish a valuation allowance of million against the net deferred tax assets 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we ended with cash of million  an increase from million at the end of working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  decreased to million at the end of  compared with million at the end of the decrease in working capital primarily was attributable to a million reduction in inventory at the end of as compared to year end neither our access to  nor the value of  our cash equivalents was materially affected by the liquidity problems experienced by certain financial institutions over the past couple of years 
our cash needs for working capital are supported by a secured credit facility 
there is risk to this capital resource stemming from current market conditions in that the amount we have available to borrow under our loan agreement primarily is driven by the estimated liquidation value of our inventory 
external factors  such as increased liquidations and bankruptcies in the marketplace  could put downward pressure on this liquidation value and thus our associated borrowing availability 
however  we continue to take steps to mitigate this risk 
first  we are focusing on maximizing cash flow and minimizing borrowing needs 
we expect to accomplish this by i increasing inventory turnover  which will require lower working capital to maintain fresh and adequate inventory at our stores  ii continuing to focus on expense control  including continual re engineering efforts to simplify and streamline administrative  inventory and other business processes  and to shrink or eliminate overhead costs as and when necessary or appropriate  and iii being conservative in capital spending and concentrating on investments with a demonstrable financial return 
second  we are improving the quality of our inventory by controlling the proportion of overstocked or discontinued goods 
third  we are maintaining communications with our lenders to keep them apprised of our business plans and to monitor their ability to fund their loan commitment 

table of contents economic conditions remain unfavorable and credit markets remain tight 
as a result  the pricing of debt under our existing credit facility may be favorable compared to the current market 
if renegotiated today  we believe our pricing would be worse and would likely result in an incremental increase in interest charges 
we do not believe such an incremental cost would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million last year 
net cash provided by operating activities improved year over year by million reflecting lower sg a expense and no restructuring charges that drove our net income and million of lower merchandise inventories due to lower purchases 
the lower inventory purchases resulted not only from lower sales expectations  but also from our focus on better overall inventory management and correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
the change in cash provided by operating activities year over year was also driven by higher accounts payable as inventory purchases were higher in the last several weeks of the year versus the prior year as we ramped up our purchases of core goods earlier in the season to enable us to maintain in stock levels to react to fluctuating customer supply and demand 
moreover  for the first time in many years  we were debt free during the entire fourth quarter of due to our continuing focus on working capital management 
as a result  in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  checks outstanding at period end were recorded as a reduction to cash and corresponding reduction to accounts payable 
historically  we funded outstanding checks with draws under our credit facility 
when we expect and intend to fund outstanding checks through borrowings under our credit agreement  we do not record a reduction to accounts payable until the checks are cashed and a corresponding increase in borrowings is recorded 
as of january   the impact was a million reduction of both cash current assets and accounts payable current liabilities 
capital growth in  our capital expenditures were million  mainly for new stores  store remodels  information technology and investment in supply chain efficiencies 
we opened nine new stores and remodeled two stores in during  we expect a moderate increase in capital expenditures from the levels  mainly for store development activities  including new stores  store remodels and expansions  and information technology enhancements 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  credit facility borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million in net credit facility repayments  partially offset by million in cash provided by financing activities related to associate share based compensation plans 
we have a credit facility that allows for borrowings of up to million and that expires in december borrowing availability is based on a percentage of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and certain accounts receivable 
at our option  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  our loan agreement provides up to million in additional financing during the term 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory and that of our subsidiaries  certain other assets related thereto  and all proceeds thereof 
the credit facility includes a million sub facility available for the issuance of commercial and stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 
at our election  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based upon one of the following rates the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank  national association at its principal office in san francisco  california or the interest rate per annum at which deposits in us dollars are offered by reference lenders to 
table of contents prime banks in designated markets located outside the united states 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving facility 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility 
for  and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was  and  respectively 
although our loan agreement contains customary covenants  including but not limited to  restrictions on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to incur debt  grant liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets  it does not contain debt or other similar financial covenants  such as maintaining certain specific leverage  debt service or interest coverage ratios 
instead  our loan is asset based which means our lenders maintain a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable which serve as collateral for the loan  and the amount we may borrow under our loan agreement at any given time is determined by the estimated liquidation value of these assets as determined by the lenders appraisers 
additional loan covenants include a requirement that we maintain minimum revolving credit availability equal to the lesser of million or of the borrowing base 
in addition  there are customary events of default under our loan agreement  including failure to comply with our covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  an event of default occurs which  if not waived by our lenders or cured within the applicable time periods  results in the lenders having the right to accelerate repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement before the stated maturity date 
a default under our loan agreement also could significantly and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 
for example  the lenders obligation to extend credit is dependent upon our compliance with these covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with our bank covenants 
at the end of fiscal year  there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility  and million was available for future borrowings 
at the end of fiscal year  borrowings under this credit facility were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to  and million was available to be borrowed 
at the end of fiscal year and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
our aggregate borrowing base cannot exceed million and was million and million as of fiscal year and  respectively 
our borrowing base at each of our last two fiscal year ends consisted of the following in millions accounts receivable availability inventory availability less reserves total borrowing base our aggregate borrowing base was reduced by the following obligations in millions ending loan balance outstanding letters of credit total obligations accordingly  our availability as of fiscal year and  respectively  was in millions total borrowing base less obligations less minimum availability total availability 
table of contents as mentioned above  our credit facility expires in december therefore  we are currently exploring financing alternatives and are in discussions with various parties 
we expect to secure a new credit facility before the expiration of our current facility 
contractual obligations aggregate information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of january  is presented in the following table in thousands 
total after years contractual cash obligations operating leases purchase commitments bank letters of credit other long term liabilities operating lease amounts in this table represent minimum amounts due under existing agreements and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments are cancelable by us without penalty  however  we do intend to honor these commitments 
the timing of the remaining cash obligations including million for uncertain tax positions cannot be predicted 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for more information 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
business trends our research indicates that the us boating industry continues to experience a down cycle  as evidenced by lower sales trends in each of our business segments compared to last year  lower new and used boat sales  and declining boat registrations in key states 
there are a number of steps we are continuing to implement in response to 
table of contents this challenging industry climate to ensure orderly management of the business and preserve our financial strength and maximize our opportunity when the marketplace recovers 
our focus has been to reduce expenses and maximize cash flow by controlling our operating expenses through variable expense management  as well as reengineering and streamlining business processes  continuing to improve the quality of our inventory by tightly controlling overstocked or discontinued goods  opening nine stores  closing stores and remodeling or expanding a small number of stores during  establishing a conservative budget for  which focuses on expense control and emphasizes working capital management  and further exploring methods and strategies to drive sales and market presence 
we believe weak economic conditions and uncertainty in the financial markets have adversely impacted discretionary consumer spending in an already challenging climate for the boating industry  and we believe that this economic weakness will continue to have an impact on our sales revenue  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in see the fiscal compared with fiscal segment revenues discussion included above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 

table of contents management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the cost or market value on an average cost basis 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we have not made any material changes in our inventory valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory write downs at january   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions vendor allowances receivable we establish a receivable and reduce inventory cost for income generated from vendor sponsored programs  or vendor allowances  that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level for the vendor allowances receivable 
our receivable for vendor allowances at both january  and january  was million  and is included in other current assets 
our vendor allowances receivable contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and in interim periods requires management to estimate future inventory purchases 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor allowances receivable during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor allowances receivable 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our estimate of our ability to collect vendor allowances at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the net present value of the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
costs associated with exit activities included in accrued expenses at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are reviewed and evaluated quarterly 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in fiscal years and  we incurred less than million and million charges  respectively  for impairment of long lived assets 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
we apply consistent methodologies to assess the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are reasonable  realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future taxable income 
actual results could differ 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
liabilities for self insurance or high deductible losses we are self insured for certain losses  including those related to employee healthcare 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
in other cases  we purchase commercial insurance  such as for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we insure workers compensation losses through a high deductible program  and we recognize our liability for the ultimate payment of incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses by accruing liabilities on an actuarial basis which represent estimates of future amounts necessary to pay claims and related expenses with respect to covered events that have occurred 
when estimating our liabilities relating to self insurance or high deductible insurance programs  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors and actuarial analysis 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by actuarial analysis to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
liabilities for our self insured losses or high deductible insurance programs contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insured liabilities and loss reserves relating to high deductible insurance programs at january   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan under which we award non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
we also have an associate stock buying plan 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards and associate stock buying plan purchases using similar valuation techniques and the closing market price of our common stock 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
a change in our assumptions for share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended january   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate or currency rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate or currency rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
at the end of the  we had no outstanding long term debt and as such would not be impacted by a change in interest rates 
we expect our interest rate exposure will increase when we enter into a new credit facility after the expiration of the current credit facility at the end of for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item a increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
