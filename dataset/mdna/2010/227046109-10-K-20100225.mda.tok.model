item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we aspire to bring comfort  fun and innovation to the world s feet 
we strive to be the global leader in molded footwear design and development 
we manufacture a product offering that provides new and exciting molded footwear products that feature fun  comfort and functionality 
we also design and sell a broad offering of footwear and accessories that utilize our proprietary closed cell resin  called croslite 
our croslite material is unique in that it enables us to produce an innovative  lightweight  non marking  and odor resistant shoe 
certain shoes made with the croslite material have been certified by us ergonomics to reduce peak pressure on the foot  reduce muscular fatigue while standing and walking and to relieve the musculoskeletal system 
since the initial introduction and popularity of our beach and cayman soon to be renamed crocs classic designs  we have expanded our croslite products to include a variety of new styles and products and have extended our product reach through the acquisition of new brand platforms such as jibbitz  llc jibbitz and ocean minded  inc ocean minded 
we intend to continue branching out into other types of footwear  bringing a unique and original perspective to the consumer in styles that may be unexpected from crocs 
in part  we believe this will help us to continue to build a stable year round business as we look to offer more winter oriented styles 
all of our products are designed to allow the product to be defined by comfort  fun  and function 
our marketing approach is also becoming significantly more focused on a defined target consumer 
the majority of our marketing efforts surround specific product launches and employ a fully integrated approach utilizing a variety of media outlets 
our marketing efforts strive to drive business to both our wholesale partners and our company owned retail and internet stores  ensuring that our presentation and story are first class and drive purchasing at the point of sale 

table of contents we currently sell our crocs branded products throughout the us and in more than countries 
we sell our products through domestic and international retailers and distributors and directly to end user consumers through our webstores  company operated retail stores  outlets and kiosks 
the broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels  including department stores and traditional footwear retailers as well as a variety of specialty and independent retail channels 
recent events from our inception through the year ended december   we experienced rapid revenue growth and had difficulty meeting demand for our footwear products 
during this period  we significantly increased our production capacity  warehouse space and inventory in an effort to meet demand 
this pattern changed in our revenue growth moderated and then began to decline during when compared to accordingly  we evaluated our production capacity and operations structure and  in  we discontinued our canadian manufacturing operations and consolidated our canadian distribution activities with other existing north american distribution operations  we abandoned certain equipment and molds that represented excess capacity  we wrote down the value of certain units in inventory that we felt we may not be able to sell for a price above cost  and we discontinued manufacturing operations at our brazilian manufacturing facility 
during and  we decreased our fixed costs by consolidating our global distribution centers and reducing our warehouse space  we took additional impairments on goodwill  intangible assets  molds  tooling  equipment and other assets related to manufacturing  distribution and sales  we executed against a plan to dispose of previously impaired inventory see below  and we reduced our global headcount by approximately 
we believe these actions were necessary in order to align our production and distribution capacities with our revised demand projections 
furthermore  we have taken actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative costs by reducing personnel  reducing our space costs by consolidating certain offices and reducing other discretionary spending 
as a result of these and other actions taken by management as part of our turnaround strategy  we achieved improved year over year gross margin in as well as improved operating margin and net loss  despite weakened economic conditions during we may  in the future  take further actions to align our cost structure with general demand for our products 
the following table summarizes our restructuring and asset impairment  including intangible assets  charges for the year ended december  warehouse and distribution consolidation other total asset impairment charges equipment and molds leasehold improvements capitalized software other intangible assets restructuring charges operating lease exit costs other restructuring costs termination benefits during the year ended december   we took certain actions to reduce our global cost structure 
actions included in the other column include the write off of obsolete molds  tooling  manufacturing equipment and sales and marketing assets and the writeoff 
table of contents of capitalized software  patents and tradenames and other intangible assets we no longer intend to utilize 
operating lease exit costs include lease termination charges for our facilities in aurora and rotterdam and freight and labor charges related to the transfer of inventory and equipment as a result of the company s decision to close and consolidate its distribution centers 
other restructuring costs include cancellation of a manufacturing agreement with a third party in bosnia  termination of the company s sponsorship agreement with the association of volleyball professionals avp  million related to obtaining a release from any further obligations under the purchase agreement with bite  llc and million in charges relating to termination of consulting arrangements with former key company employees 
throughout the year ended december   we executed against a plan for the disposal of our discontinued and impaired product inventories 
this plan included structured sales to established discount retailers  sales through our company owned outlet stores  warehouse sales and other disposition activities as well as donations to our crocs cares charitable organization 
these actions were designed to minimize adverse impacts to our resellers  distributors and company owned retail channels 
as a result of our execution against this plan  the average selling price of our products declined during the year 
however  because we were able to sell much of the previously impaired product at prices higher than what we had previously estimated would be the net realizable value of that product  the net effect of these sales during the year was accretive to our gross margin 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we offered to purchase stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for cash from certain eligible employees the tender offer in order to restore the incentive value of our long term performance award programs and in response to the fact that the exercise prices of a substantial number of outstanding stock options held by our employees far exceeded the market price of our common stock 
as part of the tender offer  we repurchased  stock options from our employees and non employee directors 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million in the quarter ending june  related to previously unrecognized share based compensation expense for these tendered and cancelled options 
of this million charge  million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses and million was recorded to cost of sales 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified an error in the calculation of stock based compensation expense for prior periods 
the errors were identified after the company s third party equity accounting software provider notified its clients  including the company  that it made a change to how its software program calculates stock based compensation expense 
specifically  the prior version of this software calculated stock based compensation expense by incorrectly continuing to apply a weighted average forfeiture rate to the vested portion of stock option awards until the grant s final vest date rather than reflecting actual forfeitures as vested  resulting in an understatement of stock based compensation expense in certain periods prior to the grant s final vest date in and because the company s stock option awards generally vest on a monthly basis after the first anniversary date of the award  the company under recognized stock based compensation expense in certain periods 
this error changes the timing of stock based compensation expense recognition  but does not change the total stock based compensation expense 
as stock based compensation expense is a non cash item  this error did not impact net cash provided by operations in any period 
this error resulted in the understatement of stock based compensation expense  with a corresponding understatement of additional paid in capital  in the approximate amounts of million in  million in the st quarter of and million in the rd quarter of note that million of the then existing cumulative error was offset as a consequence of adjustments made pursuant to the 
table of contents tender offer in the second quarter of the company recorded an additional million in stock based compensation during the fourth quarter of to correct the balance of this error 
the company does not believe that these errors or related corrections are material to its previously issued historical consolidated financial statements for or its quarterly or annual results for at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  our primary source of cash is working capital from operations 
our primary uses of cash are working capital for operations and capital expenditures 
during the year ended december   the company fully repaid its remaining obligation on its revolving credit facility with union bank of california na the revolving credit facility and entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank  na the credit agreement 
at december   there was an immaterial amount outstanding under the credit agreement 
see note notes payable and capital lease obligations for further discussion 
presentation of operating segments commencing with this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we have begun reporting our results of operations by operating segment 
we have three operating segments americas  europe and asia 
all of the reportable segments derive their revenue from the sale of footwear  apparel and accessories 
we evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and gross margin 
gross margin and operating income is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments 
operating income is defined as operating income before asset impairment charges and restructuring charges 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses or indirect general  administrative and other expenses 
the corporate and other category includes i ocean minded  ii colorado footwear cv  and iii corporate category  which maintains corporate costs such as stock based compensation  research and development  brand marketing  legal expenses  depreciation on global long lived assets such as molds  tooling  it systems  and other global costs that are not allocated to the regions 
segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate intercompany profit or losses on intercompany sales 
segment assets include the elimination of any intersegment profits or losses in inventory  however  include the elimination of intercompany receivables 
segment assets  primarily in the americas  include certain long lived assets that are depreciated in corporate due to their global functionality 
net revenues in the discussion that follows represent sales to external customers for each segment 
general revenues are recorded when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of related receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
allowances for estimated returns and discounts are recognized when related revenue is recorded 
because we use both internal manufacturing and contract with third parties to manufacture our products  our cost of sales represents our costs to manufacture products in our company owned facilities  including raw materials costs and all overhead expenses related to production  as well as the cost to purchase finished products from our third party manufacturers and costs to transport these products to our facilities  inclusive of all warehouse and outbound freight expenses 
cost of sales also includes the wages of our retail related employees as well as depreciation and amortization of manufacturing assets such as molds and tooling 

table of contents our selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs for selling  marketing and administrative employees  unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency exchange  all non product retail related expenses including rent and depreciation and professional fees  facility expenses  bank charges and non cash charges for share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization related to non product  non manufacturing assets such as our global information systems

revenues 
revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributed to a decrease in our revenues in our americas and european markets 
total unit sales of footwear products increased from million pairs during the year ended december  to million pairs in the year ended december  the decrease in revenues  despite the increase in unit sales  was the result of the execution against our plan to sell inventories of discontinued and impaired product 
sales of our discontinued and impaired product were at a lower selling price  thereby causing a decline in revenue despite the increase in units sold  as well as a decline in the average selling price of our shoes 
the average selling price of our shoes during the year ended december  was compared to during the year ended december  sales of our jibbitz products decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our wholesale channel revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  we believe that this decrease arose as a result of the global economic downturn  which has lessened consumer demand 
table of contents and caused some retailers to choose to operate at leaner inventory levels 
in addition  during the latter portion of  we implemented a more disciplined wholesale approach and  accordingly  have taken measures to reduce the number of wholesalers selling our product in order to better position the brand in the marketplace 
these measures have resulted in fewer wholesale customers 
we also believe sales of our footwear at wholesale has declined due to the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels and lessening consumer demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life 
we have also been affected by competitors entering the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
our company owned retail locations  including retail stores  kiosks and outlets  increased to locations at december   which is up from at december  total revenue from company owned retail locations increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we believe that this year over year increase in revenue is driven by an increase in the number of stores as well as the fact that we are able to merchandise the full breadth and depth of our product line 
as our retail business becomes a larger portion of our business  we expect to see some improvements in total revenue and gross margin as we have traditionally been able to achieve a higher average selling price in this channel 
we plan to close certain kiosks and selectively open more branded stores 
our plans for expanding retail locations in future periods may be adjusted or suspended should economic conditions worsen or should management determine that a different course of action for our future retail strategy is necessary 
revenues from our internet channel increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in revenues during is due primarily to increased web based and other marketing efforts aimed at driving consumer awareness of our webstores as well as the launches of several new sites serving international markets 
we intend to expand our webstores and web based and other marketing efforts as this channel enables us to showcase our entire product offering directly to the consumer  which we believe to be advantageous to us in terms of sales volume and brand awareness 
as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from our internet channel was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while still a relatively small percentage of our overall business  as our internet business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue  we expect to experience some improvements in total revenue and gross margin as we have traditionally been able to achieve a higher average selling price in this channel 
our plans for future expansion may be adjusted or suspended should economic conditions worsen or should management determine that a different course of action for our future internet strategy is necessary 
the majority of our revenues during the year ended december  were attributable to our non classic footwear models 
sales of our classic models  beach and cayman to be renamed crocs classic represented of total unit sales for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  sales of our core products  which includes beach  crocs classic  kids cayman to be renamed kids crocs classic  athens  kids athens  mary jane  girls mary jane  mammoth and kids mammoth  represented of our overall unit sales in compared to in sales of new footwear product lines represented approximately of our overall unit sales for the year ended december  we intend to continue to diversify our product offerings in order to expand our brand and expect that sales of our classic and core models will represent a smaller portion of our overall revenues in the future 
we also intend to segment our product offerings into our various sales channels and to enhance our visual and fixture merchandising platforms in company owned and wholesale customers stores to more effectively display our expanded product portfolio 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates since december  contributed million to our revenues in the year ended december  we expect that sales in international markets in foreign currencies will continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall revenues 
accordingly  
table of contents changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall revenues or the comparability of those revenues from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
americas segment revenue 
our revenues from the americas decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decline was driven by declines in our wholesale channel  offset somewhat by increases in our retail and internet channels 
we believe the net decline in revenues is reflective of economic conditions in the united states coupled with the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such products 
likewise  we believe a portion of the decline was driven by sales of end of life and impaired units  which were sold at lower prices 
see recent events above 
we have begun executing against plans to re invigorate revenue in the us wholesale channel and anticipate continuing to invest in these plans  which include  but are not limited to  investments in cooperative advertising and merchandising assistance for select locations at our largest us wholesale accounts 
we experienced a decrease in sales returns and allowances  which are included as a net adjustment to revenue  of or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales returns and allowances is due to a higher balance  when management  in light of then prevailing economic conditions  granted certain return requests and allowances to a number of customers it believed were strategically important to our ongoing business 
accordingly  our estimate for sales returns and allowances for the year ended december  was significantly higher than historical estimates as a result of specific reserves related to those granted return and allowance requests 
see also recent events above 
the number of company owned retail locations in the americas  including retail stores  kiosks and outlets  increased slightly to locations at december  from locations at december  revenue from company owned retail locations in the americas increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  asia segment revenue 
our revenues in asia increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue in the region increased as a result of strong demand in all channels  particularly in the wholesale and retail channels  offset somewhat by a lower average selling price in compared to  which we believe to be primarily driven by sales of end of life and impaired units  which were sold at lower prices  as discussed in recent events above 
we experienced a decline in sales returns and allowances of  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales returns and allowances is primarily related to a higher balance  when management  in light of then prevailing economic conditions  granted certain returns and allowances to some of our wholesale customers to properly balance their portfolios of our products with respect to size  color and style 
we increased the number of company operated retail locations in asia to locations at december   from locations at december  revenue from company operated retail locations in asia increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  europe segment revenue 
our revenues in europe decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in this decline was led by a decline at wholesale  where we experienced a drop in demand due in part to 
table of contents economic conditions and an increased number of imitation products in the region 
partially offsetting this decline were increases in revenue from our company owned retail locations partially driven by an additional retail location and an increase in revenue from our internet channel 
sales returns and allowances  which are recorded as a net adjustment to revenue  decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decline in sales returns and allowances is due to a higher balance  when management  in light of then prevailing economic conditions  granted certain return requests and allowances to a number of customers it believed were strategically important to the company s ongoing business 
accordingly  our estimate for sales returns and allowances for the year ended december  was significantly higher than historical estimates as a result of specific reserves related to those granted return and allowance requests 
see also recent events above 
as of december   we operated retail locations in europe versus in the same period of revenue from company operated retail locations was million in the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in the year ended december  gross margin increased to in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  during  we sold million of impaired product see recent events 
much of this product had been written down to a level that we considered realizable  however  we were able to sell this product at prices substantially higher than what we had previously estimated 
the gross profit amount related to these units was accretive to our gross profit percentage during the year ended december  the net effect of these sales on our gross profit during the year ended december  was million 
during  we also experienced an increase in retail and internet sales as a percentage of our total revenue  as discussed previously 
this trend has contributed to higher gross margins as we have traditionally been able to achieve a higher average selling price in these channels while many of the fixed costs associated with operating our company owned retail stores are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases in gross profit were restructuring charges of million associated with the consolidation of our warehouse and distribution space and cancellation of our warehousing agreement 
see restructuring below for further discussion 
in addition  as a result of our tender offer see recent events  we recognized million in additional stock based compensation expense through cost of sales during in addition  we now sell a wide range of products which require additional materials  such as canvas  cloth lining and suede  and additional processes  such as stitching  to manufacture  thereby increasing our direct costs and lowering our gross margins on those products 
as we continue to expand our portfolio and non classic models become a larger portion of our business  we expect that our profit margins will be adversely affected 
by comparison  during  we recorded charges of million related to inventory write downs and million related to losses on future purchase commitments 
we also recorded million in restructuring costs in cost of sales as a result of the closure of our canadian manufacturing operation see restructuring below 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates since december  decreased our gross margin by million in the year ended december  we expect that sales at subsidiary companies with functional currencies other than the us dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall gross profit 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall gross profit or the comparability of our gross profit from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decline was primarily attributable to our execution against cost savings initiatives during  offset somewhat by growth in our retail related expenses as we continued to expand our retail channel 
specifically  compared to  advertising and marketing expense declined by million  of which million was related to corporate sponsorships and million was related to advertising expenses  as we exited corporate sponsorships and changed our approach to marketing our products towards a more integrated  consumer focused program 
in addition  legal expense declined million during compared to also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is a net gain on changes in currency exchange rates for transactions denominated  and settled or to be settled  in a currency other than the functional currency of the consolidated entity of million compared to a net loss on changes in currency exchange rates of million for the year ended december  offsetting these declines were increases in stock compensation due to the tender offer of million and million due to the equity accounting software error discussed earlier  rent expense of million and salaries and wages of million 
as our retail channel becomes a larger portion of our total business  as discussed previously  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of total revenue as certain fixed costs associated with the retail channel are recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses 
changes in the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate expenses from our functional currencies to our reporting currency  the us dollar  from fiscal year to fiscal year contributed approximately million to our decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the and fiscal years  we took certain actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses 
those actions included  but were not limited to  workforce reductions  office space reductions and reductions in certain discretionary spending  including discontinuation of certain sponsorship and consulting arrangements 
we continue to evaluate our operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses 
should economic conditions further deteriorate or demand for our products decline further  we may experience further declines in revenues and we may take additional actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses further 
restructuring charges 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in the year ended december   of which million was reflected in restructuring charges and million was reflected in cost of sales 
in the year ended december   we recorded million in restructuring charges related to the closure of our facilities in canada and brazil  million of which was recorded in restructuring charges and million of which was reflected in cost of sales 
these restructuring charges arose primarily as a result of the company s execution against a plan to better align costs with current revenue streams 
the restructuring charges consisted of million related to the termination of operating leases and other costs associated with the consolidation of our warehousing  distribution and office space worldwide  million related to the termination of our manufacturing agreement with a third party in bosnia and our sponsorship agreement with association of volleyball professionals avp  million in severance costs  million related to the release from further obligation under the earn out provisions of our acquisition of bite  llc  million in other restructuring charges

impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment charges which consisted of the following items million related to the write off of obsolete molds  tooling  manufacturing and distribution equipment  sales and marketing assets and other distribution and manufacturing assets  primarily associated with the consolidation of warehouse and distribution space as well as other cost savings initiatives undertaken during the year  million related to the write off of capitalized software  patents  trade names and other intangible assets that we no longer intend to utilize  and million related to the write off of other items

loss from operations 
during the year ended december   our loss from operations was million compared to a loss of million during the year ended december   for the reasons stated above 
our operating segments  combined  generated million in operating income during  which was offset by million in restructuring costs that were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  million in asset impairment charges  and an operating loss of million related primarily to unallocated corporate costs in our corporate and other category  described previously in operating segments 
our americas segment generated operating income of million during the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million during the year ended december  during  the operating loss in our americas segment was driven primarily by declines in gross profit as a result of inventory write downs and excess capacity in our company operated manufacturing and distribution facilities 
in addition  we experienced foreign currency exchange losses related to fluctuations in the canadian dollar  mexican peso and brazilian real in during  we executed against a plan to reduce and consolidate our global warehouse footprint  which increased our americas gross margin compared to  and we experienced declines in marketing and advertising expenses as we exited corporate sponsorships and changed our approach to marketing our products 
our asia segment generated operating income of million during compared to operating income of million during during  our asia operating income was affected by foreign exchange losses and inventory impairments

we also experienced a lower loss from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during in our europe segment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  the decline in interest expense during the year was driven by lower debt balances  as we fully repaid our previous revolving credit facility on august  and had an immaterial amount of bank debt outstanding on our credit agreement as of the end of the year 
despite lower debt balances during  interest rates on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility were higher in than in  resulting in only a slight decrease in interest expense for the year

table of contents revenues 
revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributed to a decrease in our revenues in our americas and european markets  specifically driven by a decrease in unit sales of our footwear and jibbitz products 
unit sales of footwear products decreased or million pairs  to million pairs in the year ended december   from million pairs in the year ended december  sales of our jibbitz products decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our wholesale channel revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  we believe that this decrease is due to lower unit sales primarily resulting from lessening consumer demand due to the global economic downturn 
we believe unit sales of our footwear also declined due to the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as lessening consumer demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life and competitors enter the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
declines in revenue are also attributable to an increase in sales returns and allowances which are recorded as a reduction of net revenue as sales returns and allowance increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our company operated retail locations  including retail stores  kiosks and outlets  increased to locations at december   which is up from at december  total revenue from company operated retail locations increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  revenues from our webstores increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in revenues during is due primarily to increased web based and other marketing efforts aimed at driving consumer awareness of our webstores

americas market 
our revenues from the americas decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we believe the decline is reflective of economic conditions in the united states coupled with the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such products  as discussed in recent events above 
we experienced an increase in sales returns and allowances  which are included as a net adjustment to revenue  of or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales returns and allowances is primarily attributable to known and anticipated returns as well as price mark down

our revenues in europe decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in we have noted a decline in revenues in certain european countries  particularly in those which represent a more mature market for our products 
we believe a portion of this decline is due to an increased number of imitation products that we believe infringe on our intellectual property as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such product 
we believe the decline in revenues in our european market may result from the challenge of increased competition from producers of imitation products that are sold at lower products 
sales returns and allowances  which is recorded as a net adjustment to revenue  increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in sales returns and allowances is primarily attributable to known and anticipated returns as well as price mark down allowances for certain products and other products in certain colors for which we have experienced less than anticipated sales in our wholesales customer channel  as discussed in the recent events above 
as of december   we operated retail locations in europe versus in the same period of revenue from company operated retail locations was million in the year ended december  versus thousand for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in the year ended december  gross margin declined to in the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was partially the result of excess capacity in our company operated manufacturing and distribution facilities  which are recognized in our results of operations as period costs 
as of december   we recorded accrued losses on purchase commitments for inventory with a market lower than cost of million  our write down of inventories relates to certain products that were or are going to be discontinued of million  
table of contents including core products in colors that have experienced substantial declines in consumer demand  as discussed in recent events above 
likewise  we recorded million in restructuring related costs in cost of sales as a result of the closure of our canadian manufacturing operation  as explained more fully in restructuring charges below 
for the year ended december   we also experienced a change in our sales mix to include products with lower profit margins when compared to the sales mix for the year ended december  we now manufacture a wide range of products which require additional materials  such as canvas  cloth lining and suede  and additional processes  such as stitching  to manufacture 
as we continue to expand our portfolio and non classic models become a larger portion of our business  we expect this trend to continue 
the additional costs in raw materials  duties and processes associated with these styles ultimately result in lower gross profit margins 
these changes in our manufacturing structure  coupled with the inventory write downs  decrease in revenues and increase in returns and allowances were primarily responsible for the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes in foreign currency exchange rates since december  increased our gross margin by million  in the year ended december  we expect that sales at subsidiary companies with functional currencies other than the us dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall gross profit 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall gross profit or the comparability of our gross profit from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in marketing expenses of million  of which million is related to corporate sponsorships and million is related to advertising expenses  increases in building expenses of million related to additional retail and office space  increases in salaries and wages of million and increases in legal expenses of million as a result of increased legal fees for ongoing litigation and intellectual property enforcement 
in addition  total share based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is a net loss on changes in currency exchange rates for transactions denominated  and settled or to be settled  in a currency other than the functional currency of the consolidated entity of million compared to a net gain on changes in currency exchange rates of million for the year ended december  changes in the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate expenses from our functional currencies to our reporting currency  the us dollar  from fiscal year to fiscal year contributed approximately million to our change in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the fiscal year  we took certain actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses 
those actions included  workforce reductions  office space reductions  and reductions in certain discretionary spending  including discontinuation of certain sponsorship and consulting arrangements 
we are continuing to evaluate our operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses 
should economic conditions further deteriorate or demand for our products decline further  we may experience further declines in revenues and we may take additional actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses further 
restructuring charges 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in the year ended december   of which million was reflected in restructuring charges and million was reflected in cost of sales 
we did not recognize any restructuring charges during the year ended december  
table of contents during  we announced our decision to restructure our north american operations 
this decision included the closure of our canadian and brazilian manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of distribution activities into other existing north american operations 
accordingly  restructuring charges of million related to our facility operating leases were established during the year ended december   as a firm cease use date was established relating to these leases 
this is our estimated future expense related to the future abandonment of facilities under the operating leases in accordance with asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we recorded million in the year ended december  related to early termination costs for certain equipment operating leases  cancellation of purchase obligations and freight and duty charges related to transferring inventory and equipment to the united states and mexico facilities 
furthermore  we recorded million in termination benefits accounted for in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for post employment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  included in asc topic compensation nonretirement post employment benefits 
we established reserves covering future known obligations related to the closure of our canadian and brazilian manufacturing operations and the move of our canadian distribution operations 
reserves at december  were million and have been included in the line items accrued restructuring charges and long term restructuring in our consolidated balance sheets 
impairment charges 
impairment charges were million during the year ended december  we did not recognize any impairment charges during the year ended december  during  we recognized the impairment charges listed below 
a million impairment charge on fixed assets  primarily related to equipment and shoe molds 
we evaluated our production capacity at our facilities compared with demand projections and capacity requirements and decided to abandon certain manufacturing equipment that clearly represents excess capacity 
the impairment charge on molds relate to shoe styles that we either no longer intend to manufacture or styles for which we have more molds on hand than necessary to meet projected demand 
a million impairment charge related to patents which we no longer intend to utilize 
a million impairment charge related to the fury trade name and customer relationships and million related to the jibbitz trade name 
a million write off of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of million in goodwill related to the closure of fury  and million in goodwill written off as a result of an impairment analysis 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is the result of larger borrowings against our revolving credit facility for a larger portion of the year in compared to other income expense  net 
other income decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 
income tax expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  compared to income tax expense of million on pre tax income of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was a tax benefit rate during the year ended december  compared to a tax expense rate during the year ended december  the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily the result of valuation allowances being recorded on net deferred tax assets in tax 
table of contents jurisdictions where we believe it is not more likely than not that those tax benefits will be realized  due to our financial outlook as of december  and increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in august  we fully repaid our revolving credit facility with union bank of california  na we anticipate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the ongoing needs of our business for the next months 
however  in order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals  we secured an asset backed revolving line of credit  which provides us with up to million in borrowings  as described below 
additional future financing may be necessary  however  due to current macroeconomic conditions and their affect on the global credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms to us or at all 
on september   we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank  na the credit agreement  which matures on september  the credit agreement provides for an asset backed revolving credit facility of up to million in total  which includes a million sublimit for borrowings against our eligible inventory  a million sublimit for borrowings against our eligible inventory in transit  and a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the total borrowings available under the credit agreement at any given time are subject to customary reserves and reductions to the extent our asset borrowing base changes 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets  including all receivables  equipment  general intangibles  inventory  investment property  subsidiary stock and leasehold interests 
the credit agreement requires us to prepay borrowings under the credit agreement in the event of certain dispositions of property 
principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at a two percent premium over a rate that is the greater of either i pnc s published reference rate  ii the federal funds open rate in effect on such day plus one half of one percent or  iii the sum of the daily libor rate and one percent  with respect to domestic rate loans 
eurodollar denominated principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at the sum of three and one half percent premium over a rate that is the greater of i the eurodollar rate  or ii one and one half percent with respect to eurodollar loans  as applicable 
the credit agreement requires monthly interest payments with respect to domestic rate loans and at the end of each period with respect to eurodollar rate loans 
as of december   an immaterial amount was outstanding under the credit agreement 
during  million in fees and third party costs incurred to secure the credit agreement were capitalized as deferred financing costs 
the credit agreement contains certain customary restrictive and financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as december  our ability to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
due to the decline in revenues and income we experienced in and  we took certain actions to right size our production and distribution capacity in those years 
we may take additional steps to right size our business during to be commensurate with current revenue streams 
likewise  should revenues continue to decline in future periods  we may be required to take further cost reduction actions in order to maintain a level of liquidity necessary to meet our ongoing operational needs 
our ability to return to profitability is dependent on the timely completion of these activities and there can be no assurance that any actions taken by us will result in a return to profitability 

table of contents seasonal variations in product demand and the associated changes in operating assets and liabilities in response to such seasonal variations may directly and adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities 
accordingly  cash flows from operating activities for any period are not necessarily indicative of cash flows from operating activities to be expected for any other period 
the changes in the global economy could also affect our customers liquidity and capital resources and their ability to meet their payment obligations to us which  in turn  would decrease their credit terms and our ability to collect our accounts receivable  which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable aging and have recorded reserves as we deem appropriate 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  an increase of million compared to the balance as of december  the increase in accounts receivable was largely the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december  this increase was driven by the granting of return request and allowances to customers in the fourth quarter of  which we felt was a necessary action in response to the severe economic downturn and its impact on consumer demand for our products and  accordingly  our wholesale customers 
the granting of return requests and allowances to customers resulted in a higher allowance for these matters  causing a lower net accounts receivable balance for the combination of these factors artificially lowered our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of by approximately days 
we are a global business with operations in many different countries  which requires cash accounts to be held in various different currencies 
the global market has recently experienced many fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which impacts our results of operations and cash positions 
the future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
cash balances held in foreign countries have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them  which adds increased strains on our liquidity and ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the us to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not our current intent to change this position 
however  most of the cash held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal and state income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
in some countries  repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country 
certain countries  including china  have monetary laws which may limit our ability to utilize cash resources in those countries for operations in other countries 
these limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the us or other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity 
as of december   we held million of our total million in cash in international locations 
this cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held 
of the million  million could potentially be restricted  as described above 
if the remaining million were to be repatriated to the us  we would be required to pay approximately million in international withholding taxes with no offsetting credit 
we believe that there will be sufficient us net operating losses nols to absorb any increases to us net income and therefore  us federal income tax brought about by potential cash repatriation 
there are full valuation allowances on the nols that would be released to result in no tax effect or cash tax payments for the us if we were to repatriate million in cash to the us as of december  we have entered into various operating leases that require cash payments on a specified schedule 
over the next five years we will make payments of million related to our operating lease 
see contractual obligations below 
we plan to continue to enter into operating leases related to our retail stores 
our evaluation of cost reduction opportunities will include an evaluation of contracts for 
table of contents sponsorships  operating lease contracts and other contracts that require future minimum payments resulting in fixed operating costs 
any changes to these contracts may require early termination fees or other charges that could result in significant cash expenditures 
our inventories decreased to million at december   from million as of december  since early  we have been actively managing our inventory levels through decreased production and actively selling through our existing inventory with the goals of decreasing inventories and increasing our cash position 
we expect that new product introductions  limitations on production capacities and seasonal variations may cause our inventory to increase or decrease materially in the future as we adjust to meet changing market conditions 
during the years ended december  and  we had net capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
during  most of our capital expenditures were dedicated to infrastructure expansion to meet our expected sales volume  particularly during the first half of the year 
due to the revenue decline we experienced in the latter half of and in  we altered our capital expenditure strategy and  accordingly  during  spent primarily on certain infrastructure that we considered to be critical to executing our business strategy  rather than on expansion 
we will continue to make ongoing capital investments in molds and other tooling equipment related to manufacturing new products and footwear styles as well as those related to opening additional retail stores  however  we have slowed the pace at which we are opening new retail stores 
we plan to reduce our expenditures in our distribution and manufacturing due to our reduction in revenues and are currently in the process of implementing new software systems which we hope will bring greater efficiencies to our distribution strategy in the long term 
we expect to continue to invest in our global information systems infrastructure to further strengthen our management information and financial reporting capabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease obligations  which include various building and equipment transactions  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see contractual obligations below for further detail 
we also guarantee payments to our third party manufacturer in china for purchases of material for the manufacture of finished shoe products  which is not reflected on our balance sheet 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantee is million approximately million 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at december   we had purchase commitments with our third party manufacturers for million in inventory 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated four year supply agreement with finproject spa  the former majority owner of crocs canada  pursuant to which hawse have the exclusive right to purchase the material for the manufacture of finished shoe products  except for certain current customer dealings including boot manufacturers 
the supply agreement was extended through june   and provides that we meet minimum purchase requirements to maintain exclusivity throughout the term of the agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  intangible assets  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  sales returns  allowances and discounts  inventory valuation  share based compensation  income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  acquisitions and restructuring charges to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenues are derived from wholesale sales to retailers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into an agreement with a customer or persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  collection is reasonably assured  and title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the arrangement with the customer 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable we deem uncollectible 
if the financial condition of some of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
we may also accept returns from our wholesale and distributor customers  on an exception basis at the sole discretion of management for the purpose of stock re balancing to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments 
additionally  at the sole discretion of management  we may provide markdown allowances to key wholesale and distributor customers to facilitate the in channel markdown of products where we have experienced less than anticipated sell through 
sales returns  allowances and discounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances and discounts 
we base our estimates of returns on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns that have not yet been received by us 
we also consider other factors in forming our judgments to arrive at these estimates  including the number and success of new style introductions  customer inventory levels and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers  the extent to which we experience shipping delays or errors  known or suspected product defects and the seasonal nature of our business and products 
certain of these assumptions  including the impact of macroeconomic factors  the effects of seasonality  and the success of new style introductions  require significant judgment by management 
accordingly  the actual amounts of customer returns and allowances  which are inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
we have  in the past  found our estimates to be reasonable in light of actual experience 
if we determined that actual or expected returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase  as appropriate  to net sales in the period in which we made such a determination 
provisions for customer specific discounts based on contractual obligations with certain major customers are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we also record reductions to revenue for estimated customer credits as a result of price mark downs in certain markets 
fluctuations in our estimates for sales returns  allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in our sales revenue  changes in demand for our products and customer acceptance of new products we offer 
during the year ended december   we received a substantial number of return and allowance requests from its 
table of contents wholesale customers that management believes were due  in large part  to wholesaler response to rapid declines in consumer spending on a macroeconomic level as a result of the global economic downturn as well as less than anticipated sell through during the spring summer season in management granted certain return requests and allowances to customers that it believed were strategically important to our ongoing business 
accordingly  our estimate for sales returns and allowances for the year ended december   was significantly higher than historical estimates as a result of specific reserves related to these granted return and allowance requests 
management believes that the granting of return requests and allowances to customers in response to the severe economic downturn was strategically important to our business 
we cannot predict changes in macroeconomic trends  but our sell through has since improved in the wholesale channel 
accordingly  we do not expect to grant return requests and allowances to customers in the future to the extent that we did during the year ended december  however  we may grant such requests in the future  on a limited basis  should management determine returns are necessary to the future success of our business 
we are not currently aware of any circumstances that would  in the future  give rise to a significant change in sales returns and allowances as a result of the other aforementioned factors that we take into consideration when forming our judgments regarding the adequacy of our sales returns and allowances reserves 
inventory valuation 
at least quarterly  we evaluate our inventory positions and make estimates regarding the net realizable value of our inventories and  if necessary  adjust them to the lower of cost or market 
in our evaluation  we use standard categories to classify inventory based on the degree to which we believe that the products may need to be discounted to sell within a reasonable period 
certain classifications result in an impairment of inventory because the net realizable value nrv is less than the carrying value of the inventory 
our estimate of the nrv of our impaired products is based on significant judgments made by management  including assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management considers  among other things  current sell through of our products  recent changes in demand for our product as well as shifting demand between the products we offer  global and regional economic conditions  historical experience selling through liquidation and off price channels and the amount of inventory on hand 
the ultimate results achieved in selling excess and discontinued products in future periods may differ significantly from management s estimates of net realizable value 
fluctuations in our estimated nrv of our inventory may be caused by multiple factors  particularly given the sensitivity of certain qualitative factors including those regarding global and regional economic conditions as well as our ability to estimate future demand and prices based on historical experience and current sell through 
if we estimate that the nrv of our inventory is less than the current carrying cost of that inventory  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated nrv 
this write down is recorded in cost of sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
declines in the estimated nrv of our inventory  if the declines result in a write down of our inventory balance  could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
from our inception and through  we experienced substantial growth due to the high consumer demand for our core products and our expansion into new markets globally 
during the year ended december   we experienced a decline in demand due to the current economic downturn and the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as lessening demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life and competitors enter the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
based on our estimate  we recorded inventory write downs of million during the year ended december  with an additional million in charges related to losses on future purchase commitments for inventory with a market value lower than cost  of which million was included as accrued expenses  for the year ended december  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in the index to consolidated financial statements of 
table of contents this form k 
during the year ended december   we executed against a plan to reduce our inventory of impaired product and have been successful in selling or otherwise disposing of more than of the product that was impaired during the year ended december  stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards statement r  share based payment  as codified in asc topic compensation stock compensation  which requires recognition of the fair value of share based compensation over the vesting period of the option 
we adopted the prospective method for all stock option grants issued prior to august   which was the date we initially filed a registration statement on form s with the sec in connection with our initial public offering 
prior to august   we used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
we continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards which were the provisions of apb  as codified in asc compensation stock compensation and its related interpretive guidance 
for stock option grants issued after august   we applied the modified prospective method 
under this method we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options  which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility  the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates 
the volatility assumptions were derived from our historical volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation in future periods  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during any fiscal period can fluctuate based on  among other things  future stock option grants  changes in our estimated forfeiture rate pursuant to topic compensation stock compensation asc  and changes in the assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model for future stock option grants 
because the calculation of the estimate for stock based compensation is reliant on multiple inputs  which in some cases are  themselves  estimates  an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on the amount of expense recognized during a reporting period 
during the fourth quarter of we identified an error in the calculation of stock based compensation for prior periods 
to correct these errors  we recorded additional stock based compensation expense of million during the year ended december  see recent events for further discussion 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  as codified in accounting standards codification topic income taxes asc 
effective january   we adopted asc  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law  the body of statutory  regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous 
because of this  whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
no portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
also  under asc  interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions 
the adoption of fin  as codified in asc  did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet  statement of operations or cash flows 

table of contents our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
we have formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as codified in asc topic intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by asc topic  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to their carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
during the three month period ended september   our stock price declined substantially  which represented a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment 
as of september   we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation  as required under asc topic based on that evaluation we concluded our goodwill was impaired and we recorded a charge of million  which 
table of contents was our entire goodwill balance as of september  please refer to note  goodwill and intangible assets  of our consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives  such as customer relationships  core technology  capitalized software  patents and non compete agreements are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test long lived assets to be held and used for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
events that may indicate the impairment of long lived assets include  i a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group  v current period operating or cash flow losses combined with historical operating or cash flow losses of a particular long lived asset group or a forecast of cash flows that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group  and vi a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we evaluate for these types of events or circumstances at least quarterly 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if an asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
fair value is determined by independent third party appraisals  the net present value of expected cash flows  or other valuation techniques as appropriate 
assets to be abandoned or from which no further benefit is expected are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of million on fixed assets  primarily related to equipment and shoe molds  sales and marketing assets and assets that we no longer intend to use as we consolidate our warehouse and distribution space 
these charges are recorded in the impairment charges line item of the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   and are accounted for as assets to be abandoned in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment 
also refer to note  restructuring activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider our recent operating and cash flow losses to indicate that the carrying value of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
through september  we had determined that we had one asset group in support of its footwear manufacturing  distribution and sales business as this is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
beginning in q  we have determined that the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the retail store level for assets involved in our retail business 
assets not included in our retail business are considered one asset group 
we estimated the future 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows to be generated by our asset group and compared the future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset group to determine whether the asset group was recoverable 
our estimates of future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset group were based on management s operating budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts take into consideration inputs from our regional management related to growth rates  pricing  new markets and other factors expected to affect the business  as well as management s forecasts for inventory  receivables  capital spending  and other cash needs 
these considerations and expectations are inherently uncertain and  given our limited operating history of as well as the global economic downturn  estimates included in our operating forecasts beyond a three to six month future period are extremely subjective 
accordingly  actual cash flows may differ significantly from our estimated future cash flows 
based on our analysis the carrying value of our asset group was recoverable and there was no impairment indicated 
accordingly  we did not prepare estimates of the fair value of the asset group to be held and used 
due to the nature of impairment charges  changes in the reserves and expenses related to these charges incurred between reporting periods can be significant as they are driven by  among other things  changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions  global and regional economic conditions  demand for our product or shifting demand between different products we offer and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long lived assets and result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
likewise  significant impairment charges recognized during a reporting period could have an adverse affect on our reported financial results 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close distribution and administrative facilities according to sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and as codified in asc topic compensation nonretirement post employment benefits 
in connection with these activities  we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs and other restructuring related costs 
we also recognize restructuring charges related to our future expense related to the future abandonment of facilities under the operating leases in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  included in asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in restructuring charges for the closure of various warehouses and office buildings and employee severances as well as settlement and termination of contracts prior to term 
please refer to note  restructuring activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of these restructuring charges require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
at the end of each reporting period  we will evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
due to the nature of restructuring charges  changes in the liabilities and expenses related to these charges incurred between reporting periods can be significant as they are driven by  among other things  our strategic operational and financial decisions  global and regional economic conditions  staffing levels relative to demand for our products and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate the need for certain assets or staff positions in our locations 
significant restructuring charges could adversely affect our reported financial results in the reporting period in which the charges are recognized and  to the extent we are required to make future cash payments for items such as severance and lease buyouts or penalties  our liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit and interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that interest rates change due to inflation or other factors 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
on august   we fully repaid our remaining obligation on our revolving credit facility with union bank of california  na prior to its maturity date of september  the revolving credit facility effectively terminated upon full repayment 
on september   we entered into a credit agreement with pnc bank na the bank for an asset backed revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings of up to million in total  subject to certain restrictions 
principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement will bear interest at a two percent premium over a rate that is the greater of either i the bank s published reference rate  ii the federal funds open rate 
table of contents in effect on such day plus one half of one percent  or iii the sum of the daily libor rate and one percent  with respect to domestic rate loans 
eurodollar denominated principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement will bear interest at the sum of three and one half percent premium over a rate that is the greater of i the eurodollar rate  or ii one and one half percent with respect to eurodollar loans  as applicable 
the credit agreement requires monthly interest payments with respect to domestic rate loans and at the end of each period with respect to eurodollar rate loans 
as of december   an immaterial amount was outstanding under the credit agreement  accordingly  there is minimal impact from interest rate risk related to our credit agreement 
we earned interest income of million on our cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates  and if the weighted average rate of return on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were to increase or decrease by  the impact on interest income would be approximately million  net of tax during the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk we have significant revenues from foreign sales in recent periods 
while the majority of expenses attributable to our foreign operations are paid in the functional currency of the country in which such operations are conducted  we pay the majority of our overseas third party manufacturers in us dollars 
our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for our products or losses from currency exchange rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates 
if the us dollar were to increase or decrease  as applicable  in value by  the impact on international sales of million during the year ended december  would have been an increase or decrease  as applicable  in consolidated revenues by million 
the volatility of the applicable exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and purchases increase and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies we receive for such sales 
please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rate variances experienced in the year ended december  we intend to  in the future  engage in foreign exchange hedging contracts to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
if we do engage in foreign exchange hedging  the foreign exchange hedging contracts will be entered into to hedge specific commitments and anticipated transactions but not for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we did not have any unsettled foreign exchange hedging contracts
