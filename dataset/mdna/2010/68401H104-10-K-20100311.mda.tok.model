item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and other parts of this report may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative anti infective products 
our current development efforts are focused on products that treat gastrointestinal infections  and related diseases where current therapies have limitations  including limited efficacy  serious adverse side effects  drug to drug interactions  difficult patient compliance and bacterial resistance 
we currently have two late stage anti infective product candidates  fidaxomicin and pruvel prulifloxacin 
fidaxomicin  our lead product candidate  is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with minimal systemic absorption 
we are developing fidaxomicin for the treatment of cdi  the most common nosocomial  or hospital acquired  diarrhea 
in february  we reported positive top line data from the second of two fidaxomicin phase trials 
in november  we reported positive data from the first fidaxomicin phase trial  the largest single comparative study ever conducted against vancocin 
the top line analysis of data from these trials showed that fidaxomicin achieved the primary endpoint of clinical cure and demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate compared to vancocin  the only fda approved antibiotic for the treatment of cdi 
fidaxomicin was also well tolerated in the trials 
throughout  we presented additional data from the first fidaxomicin phase trial 
in may  we presented additional data at the digestive disease week that showed that fidaxomicin overall demonstrated a lower recurrence rate compared to oral vancomycin in the patient regardless of serum albumin levels  white blood cell count and temperature  and non bi nap strains  the risk factors believed to be predictive of cdi recurrence following treatment 
in september  we reported additional data during the th annual interscience conference on antimicrobial agents  or icaac which describe fidaxomicin s low recurrence rate  safety profile  potent activity against cdi  and minimal disruption to the normal intestinal flora 
in october  we reported additional data during the th annual meeting of the infectious diseases society of america idsa which showed that fidaxomicin was associated with a faster time to resolution of diarrhea than vancomycin and that patients who received concomitant antibiotics  those treated with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin  had significantly improved global rate cure rate  lower cdi recurrence rate and higher clinical cure rate 
we expect to report additional data from our second fidaxomicin phase trial at scientific and medical conferences throughout we currently hold worldwide rights to fidaxomicin and intend to seek one or more partners for the commercialization of fidaxomicin outside of the united states 
we plan to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda in the second half of and are also preparing a marketing authorization application  or maa  for submission to the european medicines agency  or ema 
pruvel is a prodrug in the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics  a widely used class of broad spectrum antibiotics 
we are developing pruvel as a treatment for infectious diarrhea 
in july  we reported positive top line data from the first phase trial conducted in mexico and peru and in february  we reported positive top line data from the second phase trial conducted in india  guatemala and mexico 
the top line analysis of data from these studies showed that pruvel met the primary endpoint of tlus compared to placebo 
we intend to conduct a phase trial of pruvel subsequent to a nda submission to compare pruvel to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of infectious diarrhea 
we plan to initially seek approval for pruvel for the treatment of infectious diarrhea 

table of contents we are developing additional product candidates using our proprietary technology  including our optimer one pot synthesis  or opops drug discovery platform 
opops is a computer aided technology that enables the rapid and low cost synthesis of a wide array of carbohydrate based compounds 
two components of the opops technology that allow us to synthesize new compounds are glycooptimization and de novo glycosylation 
these technologies are capable of rapidly generating drug candidates for broad therapeutic application 
we previously acquired exclusive rights to two other product candidates opt  a disease modifying intra articular therapy for osteoarthritis which we licensed from tsri and opt  a novel carbohydrate based cancer immunotherapy which we licensed from mskcc 
in october  we entered into a number of transactions involving our taiwanese subsidiary obi  in which we sold of our existing equity in obi to a group of new investors and  simultaneously  we and the group of new investors purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of new common shares of obi 
in connection with these transactions  we assigned to obi certain of our patent rights and know how related to opt and opt and also assigned to obi our rights and obligations under the tsri and mskcc agreements 
we anticipate that obi will use the proceeds from the sale of new common shares to fund the development of opt and opt following these transactions  we maintain a equity interest in obi and have the right to receive up to million in future milestone payments for each product incorporating opt or opt and royalties on net sales of any such products 
we were incorporated in november since inception  we have focused on developing our product candidates  including fidaxomicin and pruvel 
we have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including the costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current lead product candidates  license fees and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates  as well as acquire or in license additional products or product candidates  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
financial operations overview collaboration and grant revenues we have not generated any revenues from sales of commercial products 
since inception  we have generated revenues primarily as a result of various collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and grants from government agencies 
we may also periodically recognize as revenues non refundable payments for achieving certain milestones during the term of our collaboration agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates and developing and advancing our drug discovery technology 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials managed by our cros and costs associated with non clinical research activities and regulatory approvals 
our most significant costs are for clinical trials  including payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  manufacturers of clinical supplies and related consultants 
our historical research and development expenses have resulted predominantly from our clinical trials of fidaxomicin and pruvel  the development of our carbohydrate technology platforms  including opops  in licensing fees and general research activities 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
from inception through december   we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately million 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects  and much of this use is not allocable to a specific project 
accordingly  we do not account for all of our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
in addition to our internal resources  we use external service providers and vendors to conduct our clinical trials  to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other research and development related products and services 
these external costs are allocable to specific projects 

table of contents external costs are expensed as incurred 
we incurred million  million and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of fidaxomicin for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
we incurred million  million  and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of pruvel for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
all other research and development expenses were for other clinical programs 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we complete our clinical trial activities with respect to fidaxomicin  prepare regulatory filings for marketing approval of fidaxomicin and pruvel  incur expenses related to large scale manufacturing of fidaxomicin and pruvel  advance our other product candidates through the development process and invest in additional product opportunities and research programs 
although we expect our costs associated with clinical trials to decrease as we complete the second of two phase clinical trials for fidaxomicin  we expect to incur substantial costs in the preparation of applications for regulatory approval and manufacturing and scale up for fidaxomicin and pruvel 
the process of conducting pre clinical and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates is time consuming  expensive and subject to many uncertainties 
for example  the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients enrolled  the rate of enrollment and the duration of patient treatment and follow up 
in addition  it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly lengthen the regulatory approval process and increase expenses 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
however  while we do not have specific estimates for the costs of all of our projects  we currently estimate that we will incur external costs of approximately million to complete the phase clinical trials for fidaxomicin to treat cdi 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to an allocated portion of facility cost  legal fees and other professional services expenses  our corporate administrative employees and insurance costs 
we anticipate that we will maintain our existing level of general and administrative expenditures 
however  we will make determinations as to the necessary levels of general and administrative expenditures on an on going basis in response to our research and development activities and regulatory obligations 
interest income expense and other  net interest income expense and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and other than temporary declines in the market value of available for sale securities and cash and non cash interest charges related to bridge financings 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december  we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
the foreign losses originate from our subsidiary in taiwan 
the losses from our subsidiary in taiwan expire ten years after origination 
as of december   we had both federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credits will begin expiring in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carryforward indefinitely 
as of december   we had a state manufacturer s investment tax credit carryforward of approximately  which will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire 
as of december   we have completed a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and credit carryovers and had determined that the maximum amount of us federal and state nol and credit carryovers are available for utilization  subject to the annual limitation 
based on the analysis  the related deferred tax assets were reinstated in and the corresponding valuation allowance was increased 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of future limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our license and collaboration agreements contain multiple elements  including non refundable upfront fees  payments for reimbursement of third party research costs  payments for ongoing research  payments associated with achieving specific development milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a unique earnings process associated with each element of a contract 
cash received in advance of services being performed is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed over the applicable term of the agreement 
when a payment is specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenues are recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant and substantive milestones 
revenues from milestone payments may be considered separable from funding for research services because of the uncertainty surrounding the achievement of milestones for products in early stages of development 
accordingly  these milestone payments are allowed to be recognized as revenue if and when the performance milestone is achieved if they represent a substantive earnings process 
in connection with certain research collaboration agreements  revenues are recognized from non refundable upfront fees  which we do not believe are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the agreement or the period over which we have significant involvement or perform services 
research fees are recognized as revenue as the related research activities are performed 
with respect to revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants  in transactions where we act as a principal with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
none of the payments that we have received from collaborators to date  whether recognized as revenue or deferred  are refundable even if the related program is not successful 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials  compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to research and development  including personnel costs  facilities costs and depreciation 
when nonrefundable payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are made  we defer and capitalize these types of payments 
the capitalized amounts are expensed when the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
accrued clinical trial costs a substantial portion of our on going research and development activities are performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  who conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue the costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and costs historically incurred for similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  we adjust our accruals 
historically  our accruals have been within management s estimates  and no material adjustments to research and development expenses have been recognized 
subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  authoritative guidance requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we used the modified prospective method and accordingly we did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our stock awards based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are based on the historical fluctuation in the stock price since inception 
the average expected term is calculated using the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis or sooner if there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and collaboration and grant revenues

comparison of years ended december  and collaboration and grant revenues 
collaboration and grant revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from a nih research grant  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from collaboration with a natural healthcare company which was completed in 
table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was due primarily to a million payment in to par to regain the rights to fidaxomicin in north america  and the purchase of million of clinical supply material and active pharmaceutical ingredient 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in expenses of million related to our fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin phase clinical trials in marketing expense 
marketing expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase in medical education and pre launch marketing efforts related to fidaxomicin 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase of  or was due to higher legal  accounting  investor relations  and compensation expenses  including an increase of  in stock compensation expense over the same period in the prior year 
interest income and other  net 
net interest income and other for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was primarily due to lower cash and short term investments and lower overall interest rates 
in addition  we recorded impairment on our long term investments of  in liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through march   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows in may  we sold a total of million shares of series a preferred stock for proceeds of million  from march to december  we sold a total of million shares of series b preferred stock for proceeds of million  in april  we sold a total of million shares of series c preferred stock for proceeds of million  from april to november  we sold a total of million shares of series d preferred stock for proceeds of million  in february  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering for proceeds of million  in october  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement offering for proceeds of million  in july  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million  in march  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million  and in march  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a public offering for proceeds of million 
until required for operations  we invest a substantial portion of our available funds in money market funds  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments  all of which are investment grade quality 
we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 

table of contents cash flows as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately million as compared to million as of december   a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the use of cash for our operating expenses offset by the million raised in a registered direct offering of our common stock in march and million of net cash received from the october obi transactions 
of the million  million was held by obi as of december  we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase over the next few years as we advance the development of our product candidates and prepare for regulatory submissions and commercialization 
in february  we regained worldwide rights to fidaxomicin from par under a prospective buy back agreement 
we are obligated to pay par a one time million milestone payment  a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in north america and israel  and a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
in addition  in the event we license our right to market fidaxomicin in the rest of the world  we will be required to pay par a royalty on net revenues we receive related to fidaxomicin 
we are obligated to pay each of these royalties  if any  on a country by country basis for seven years commencing on the applicable commercial launch in each such country 
in connection with the exercise of our rights under the prospective buy back agreement  par assigned to us a supply agreement with biocon 
under this agreement  biocon is obligated to supply to us our requirements of the fidaxomicin active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain markets 
in june  we entered into a license agreement with nippon shinyaku to which we acquired the non exclusive right to import and purchase pruvel  and the exclusive right with the right to sublicense  within the united states  to develop  make  use  offer to sell  sell and license products suitable for consumption by humans containing pruvel 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be required to pay nippon shinyaku a milestone payment in the amount of million upon the filing  if any  of a nda for pruvel in the united states 
in october  our compensation committee adopted a severance benefit plan covering certain eligible employees of the company  including executive officers 
pursuant to the plan  upon an involuntary termination other than for cause  an eligible employee may be entitled to receive specified severance benefits 
the benefits may include cash severance payments and acceleration of stock award vesting 
the level of benefits provided under the plan depends upon an eligible employee s position and years of service  and whether the termination is related to a change in control 
in october  we entered into certain transactions with our subsidiary  obi  pursuant to which we assigned certain intellectual property rights and license agreements to obi related to our opt and opt product candidates 
in connection with these transactions  we entered into a financing agreement with obi and a group of new investors 
under the terms of the financing agreement  if obi achieves certain development milestones with respect to opt and opt  we and the group of new investors may be required to purchase approximately an additional million and million  respectively  of new obi common shares 
while we currently cannot anticipate when  if ever  obi will achieve these development milestones  under the terms of the financing agreement  our obligation to purchase the additional obi common shares will not be triggered prior to june  funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the following the progress of our clinical trials  including expenses to support the trials and the milestone payments that may become payable to par and nippon shinyaku  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting  enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing sales or distribution capabilities  the success of the commercialization of our products  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and collaborations and government grants 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in completing future equity financings  in entering into additional collaboration agreements  in receiving milestone or royalty payments under new or existing collaboration agreements  in obtaining new government grants or in obtaining debt financing 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the government take over  bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain  and may negatively impact our ability to complete financing transactions 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all of our rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise funds by incurring additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations our facilities currently consist of laboratory and office space in two facilities in san diego  california 
our operating leases for these facilities expire on november with one of our leases subject to a one five year renewal option and the other lease subject to a two year renewal option 
we contracted with a cro for clinical research services for the fidaxomicin phase clinical trials and prulifloxacin phase clinical trials 
we have issued purchase orders totaling million as of december  for these services  million  million and million were issued in   and  respectively 
as of december   we have paid million related to these purchase orders 
we can terminate the service agreement at any time upon days written notice to the cro 
we have not included any amounts related to the cro contract in the table above 
the contractual obligations table does not include a a potential future milestone payment in the amount of million to nippon shinyaku due upon filing our first nda in the united states for pruvel  b potential requirement to purchase approximately million of new obi common stock shares if obi achieves certain development milestones with respect to opt and opt product candidates  c potential future milestone payments to cempra in the amount of million due upon the regulatory approval of each of the first two products we develop under our licensing agreement with cempra in any country which is a member of the association of southeast asian nations  or asean  d potential future milestone payments of up to million to tsri due upon achievement of certain clinical milestones  the filing of ndas or their foreign equivalents and government marketing and distribution approval or e a future million milestone payment to par upon the earliest occurrence of i the successful completion by us of our second pivotal phase trial for fidaxomicin  ii our grant to a third party of the rights to fidaxomicin or iii the submission to the fda of an nda for fidaxomicin 
we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of pruvel  fidaxomicin and other licensed product candidates 
the milestone and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb issued the following recent new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued an update to the accounting and disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this update requires new disclosures on significant transfers or assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons these transfers and the reasons for any transfers in or out of level this update also requires a reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales and issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition to these new disclosure requirements  this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
for example  this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities 
this update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
this update will be effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning january   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will become effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued an update to the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable 
this update eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities  or vie 
this update requires a quantitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the update will be effective as to us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this update  but do not expect that this update will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this update is intended to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
this update removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and the exception from applying consolidation of variable interest entities to qualifying special purpose entities 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this update will be applied to transfers that occur on or after january   which is the date upon which this accounting update becomes effective for us 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this update  but do not expect that this update will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and marketable securities risk our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in approximately a  change in net loss 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates applicable to our securities portfolio 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
fair value measurements all of our investment securities are available for sale securities and are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at market value except for one auction rate preferred securities  or arps with a par value of approximately million 
as a result of the negative conditions in the global credit markets  our arps is currently not liquid 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  until the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 

table of contents foreign currency risk we have operated primarily in the united states of america and most transactions during the year ended december   have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we do not have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place 
we have conducted clinical trials in europe in conjunction with inc research  our cro  where we have clinical sites being monitored by clinical research associates 
while invoices relating to these clinical trials are generally denominated in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as inflation in foreign currencies  in relation to the us dollar  in markets where these vendors have assisted us in conducting these clinical trials 
certain transactions related to our company and our subsidiary  obi  are denominated primarily in taiwan dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where optimer conducts business  including the impact of the existing crisis in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the us dollar and the taiwan dollars 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
currently  we do not expect the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of other currencies to be material in
