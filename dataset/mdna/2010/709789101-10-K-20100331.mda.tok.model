over  totaling  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included below under the caption financial condition market risk management 
results of operations we reported net income of  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to  or per share  for the year ended december  this represents a decrease for of  or when compared to net interest income the primary source of our income is net interest income  which is the difference between revenue on interest earning assets  such as investment securities and loans  and interest incurred on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balance of interest earning assets and funding sources and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing funding sources 
the table average balances  interest  and yields that appears below shows our average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for and  and related income expense and yields 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is affected by the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 
the table analysis of changes in net interest income shows the amount of net interest income change from rate changes and from volume changes 
for the year ended december   net interest income decreased  or  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income in was the result of a  decrease in interest income offset by a  decrease in interest expense 
in  deposits increased but our borrowed funds decreased with loan demand 
net income decreased because the yield earned on loans declined faster than yields on deposits and borrowed funds 
the yield on interest earning assets on a fully taxable equivalent basis was in and in  with the combined effective rate on deposits and borrowed funds following the same fluctuation by decreasing from in to in the key performance measure for net interest income is the net margin on interest earning assets  or net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
our net interest margin for on a fully taxable equivalent basis was  compared to for management attempts to maintain a net margin on interest earning assets of or higher 
the net margin may decline  however  if competition increases  loan demand decreases  or the cost of funds rises faster or declines slower than the return on loans and securities 
although such expectations are based on management s judgment  actual results will depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  and fulfillment of management s expectations cannot be assured

noninterest revenue noninterest revenue for the months ended december  was  compared to  for same period in this increase resulted primarily from a  increase in the insurance subsidiary s insurance commissions when compared to the following table presents the principal components of noninterest revenue for the years ended december  and noninterest revenue service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions other noninterest revenue total noninterest revenue noninterest revenue as a percentage of average total assets noninterest expense noninterest expense for the month period ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in the largest component of this increase was the bank s regulatory assessment 
regulatory assessments increased  or  as the result of increased fdic insurance premiums 
office supplies expense increased in over and furniture and equipment expense increased in over primarily due to the conversion of the bank s data processing from the delmarva data center to fis banking solutions

increases in gross revenues combined with decreases in noninterest expenses and a substantial increase in the provisions for loan loss  offset by increased income taxes  contributed to the increase in net income for the fourth quarter of when compared to the same period last year 
before provisions for loan losses  the net interest income increase of  from  for the three months ended december  to  for the three months ended december   was due primarily to loan revenues and borrowed funds interest expense reducing in direct correlation to the reduction in loan and borrowed funds account balances 
deposit balances rose during this period but interest expense decreased as the direct result of lower interest rates for the period and the repricing of matured time deposits at lower rates

funding for loans is provided primarily by core deposits  fed funds  and fhlb borrowings 
total deposits increased to  at december  when compared to composition of loan portfolio because loans are expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets assuming that loan losses are not excessive  the absolute volume of loans and the volume as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin

our ratio of average loans to average deposits plus borrowed funds was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  we extend loans primarily to customers located in and near kent county  queen anne s county and cecil county in maryland 
there are no industry concentrations in our loan portfolio 
a substantial portion of our loans are  however  secured by real estate and  accordingly  the real estate market in the region will influence the performance of our loan portfolio

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of our customers  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
we generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments that we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further information about these commitments 
loan quality the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due  and other loans that management believes require attention 
the determination of the reserve level rests upon management s judgment about factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economy 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required 
for significant problem loans  management s review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrowers and guarantors  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
the overall evaluation of the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan charge offs  delinquency trends  and previous collection experience  along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
risk elements of loan portfolio for the years ended december  non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more the following table  allocation of allowance for loan losses  shows the specific allowance applied by loan type and also the general allowance included in the allowance for loan losses at december  and allocation of allowance for loan losses percentage percentage commercial real estate consumer unallocated total percentage of loans in category to total loans the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan losses was  in  which represents an increase of  over the  that was funded in we added to our reserves in anticipation of potential losses in connection with the higher than normal balances of nonaccrual loans and loans accruing days or more past due 
the following table shows information about the allowance for loan losses for each of the last two years allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year loan losses commercial mortgages consumer total loan losses recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial mortgages consumer total loan recoveries net loan losses provision for loan losses charged to expense balance at end of year allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of year net charge offs to average loans as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as nonaccrual when it is not reasonable to expect collection of interest under the original terms 
these loans are classified as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrower s financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
interest on nonaccrual loans is recognized only when received 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that had been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
we had nonperforming loans of  and  at december  and  respectively 
we had  and  in foreclosed other real estate at december  and  respectively 
foreclosed other real estate is considered part of non performing assets 
loans are classified as impaired when the collection of contractual obligations  including principal and interest  is doubtful 
management considers the nonaccrual loans as of december  to be impaired loans 
investment securities our security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and held to maturity 
investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for liquidity purposes as part of our overall asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  net of applicable income taxes 
we do not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view of near term resales and  therefore  do not own any securities classified as trading securities 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are held until they mature 
held to maturity securities are held at amortized cost value

liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
the funds invested in federal funds sold also provide liquidity  as do lines of credit  overnight federal funds  and reverse repurchase agreements available from correspondent banks 
the aggregate amount available from correspondent banks under all lines of credit at december  was  additionally  the bank has a partially funded line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
this line is secured by the bank s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
average liquid assets cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities were of average deposits for  compared to for we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is primarily dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the degree to which these different assets mature or reprice is known as interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of net interest income 
to lessen the impact of these margin swings  the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
interest rate sensitivity may be controlled on either side of the balance sheet 
on the asset side  management can exercise some control on maturities 
also  loans may be structured with rate floors and ceilings on variable rate notes and by providing for repricing opportunities on fixed rate notes 
our investment portfolio  including federal funds sold  provides the most flexible and fastest control over rate sensitivity since it can generally be restructured more quickly than the loan portfolio 
on the liability side  deposit products can be restructured so as to offer incentives to attain the maturity distribution desired 
competitive factors sometimes make control over deposits more difficult and less effective 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a given time interval 
the general objective of gap management is to actively manage rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest margin 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize our overall interest rate risk 
several aspects of the asset mix of the balance sheet are continually evaluated yield  credit quality  appropriate funding sources  and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
the interest rate sensitivity position at december  is presented in the table interest sensitivity analysis 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
we were asset sensitive for the under one year time horizons and liability sensitive for time frames after one year 
for asset sensitive institutions  if interest rates should decrease  the net interest margins should decline 
because all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the gap is only a general indicator of rate sensitivity

our core deposits increased  during  primarily due to recent conditions in the economy 
in the past  deposits  particularly core deposits  have been our primary source of funding and have enabled us to meet our short term liquidity needs 
in recent years  we have borrowed from correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta to meet liquidity needs 
the maturity distribution of our time deposits over  at december  is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more december  within three months after three through six months after six through months after months total certificates of deposit  or more large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rates  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not typically purchase brokered deposits 
the average balance of borrowings decreased  or  in  compared to a decrease of  or  in the decrease in when compared to was due primarily to the fact that loan demand has reduced and we were able to reduce our lines of credit particularly at the fhlb of atlanta during short term borrowings the following table sets forth our position with respect to short term borrowings for each of the last two years ended december amount rate amount rate at year end federal home loan bank daily re price repurchase agreements federal funds borrowed average for the year federal home loan bank daily re price retail repurchase agreements federal funds borrowed maximum month end balance federal home loan bank daily re price retail repurchase agreements federal funds borrowed the bank may borrow up to approximately of total assets from the fhlb of atlanta through any combination of notes or line of credit advances

the table below compares the capital ratios of the bank with the regulatory minimums 
the company s only assets in other than its equity interest in the bank were its equity interest in the insurance subsidiary and a small amount of cash

rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative guidance for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the asc carries an equal level of authority 
all non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the asc is superseded and deemed non authoritative 
the switch to the asc affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the asc involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
the following accounting guidance has been approved by the fasb and would apply to the company if the company or the bank entered into an applicable activity 
fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities changes existing guidance for determining whether an impairment is other than temporary to debt securities and replaces the existing requirement that the entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with a requirement that management assert a it does not have the intent to sell the security  and b it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
under asc topic  declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses 
the amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
adoption of asc topic was effective in the first quarter of and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits provides guidance related to an employer s disclosures about plan assets of defined benefit pension or other post retirement benefit plans 
under asc topic  disclosures should provide users of financial statements with an understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made  the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
adoption of the disclosure requirements of asc topic was effective beginning with the financial statements for the year ended december  and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting standards update no 
 under fasb asc topic  fair value measurement and disclosures  provides authoritative guidance for measuring the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
in such a case  the reporting company must measure fair value utilizing a valuation technique that uses i the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  ii quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or iii another valuation technique that is consistent with the existing principles of asc topic  such as an income approach or market approach 
the new authoritative accounting guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
the new authoritative accounting guidance under asc topic was effective for the company s financial statements beginning october   and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
fasb asc topic  subsequent events establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
asc topic defines i the period after the balance sheet date during which a reporting entity s management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements ii the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and iii the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
asc topic became effective for periods ending after june   and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
fasb asc topic  transfers and servicing enhances reporting about transfers of financial assets  including securitizations  and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this new guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets 
it also requires additional disclosures about all continuing involvements with transferred financial assets including information about gains and losses resulting from transfers during the period 
asc topic is effective january  and has not had a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
the accounting policies adopted by management are consistent with authoritative us gaap and are consistent with those followed by peer bank holding companies and banks
