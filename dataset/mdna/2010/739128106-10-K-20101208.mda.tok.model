risk factors contained in this annual report 
overview we develop  design  manufacture and service custom engineered to order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes 
headquartered in houston  texas  we serve the transportation  environmental  energy  industrial and utility industries 
our business operations are consolidated into two business segments electrical power products and process control systems 
revenues and costs are primarily related to engineered to order equipment and systems  which precludes us from providing detailed price and volume information 
throughout fiscal years and  we experienced strong market demand for our products and services 
new investments in oil and gas infrastructure  as well as new investments by municipal and transit authorities to expand and improve public transportation  were key drivers of increased business volume with favorable margins in fiscal year customer inquiries and requests for proposals remained strong throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal accordingly  we entered fiscal with a strong backlog of orders which resulted in record revenues in fiscal year throughout the second half of  customer inquiries and requests for proposal activity decreased and an increasing number of our customers began to cancel or delay the start of new capital projects for various reasons 
this decreased our backlog of orders during  and we began fiscal year with a backlog of million  a million decrease from the backlog of orders at the beginning of fiscal year the order backlog at september   was million 
this decline in orders related to large capital projects with favorable margins in the second half of fiscal and throughout fiscal year will reduce our revenues and gross profits in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal years and on december   we acquired the business and certain assets of powercomm inc and its subsidiaries  redhill systems ltd  nextron corporation  pcg technical services inc and concorde metal manufacturing ltd the entire business of which is referred to herein as powell canada 
powell canada is headquartered in edmonton  alberta  canada  and provides electrical and maintenance services in western canada 
powell canada is also a manufacturer of switchgear and related products  primarily serving the oil and gas industry in western canada 
the operating results of powell canada are included in our electrical power products business segment from the acquisition date 
in conjunction with the acquisition of powell canada  on april   we finalized the acquisition of a ownership in a joint venture in kazakhstan 
the company has made a strategic decision to exit this joint venture 
for further information on the powell canada acquisition  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements

selling  general and administration expenses increased as a percentage of revenues as a result of our decline in revenues  along with the fact that portions of our sales and administrative support infrastructure is necessary to support our customers  invest in information systems  continue research and development and pursue project opportunities 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this increase was from the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of powell canada 
impairment of goodwill an impairment of goodwill of approximately million was recorded in fiscal related to the powell canada acquisition 
the company s strategic decision to exit the owned joint venture in kazakhstan and delays in the anticipated growth in capital investments in the oil sands region of western canada  relative to our expectations  resulted in the impairment charge 

table of contents interest income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower amounts outstanding under our us and us credit facilities during fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from larger cash amounts being invested during fiscal income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the valuation allowance recorded related to foreign deferred tax assets

as previously discussed  net income in fiscal included the benefit of the million mediated settlement  reduced by legal and other expenses of approximately million  net of tax  related to a previously completed contract that was in dispute for several years 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal backlog decreased during the second half of fiscal and into fiscal due to the ongoing economic downturn which has led our customers to reduce and delay spending on new capital projects 
this decline in backlog throughout fiscal negatively impacted our revenues in fiscal and will continue to negatively impact our revenues going into fiscal compared to twelve months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues increased as we responded to strong market demand by increasing our capacity and throughput 
domestic revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as the result of changes in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to an increased sales effort and strong market demand in fiscal and the first half of fiscal gross profit in fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal as a result of our ability to absorb our fixed costs and improved pricing as a result of strong market activity

consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of decreased commissions and incentive compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support our increased production volume  along with the timing of commissions related to new orders 
interest income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and the lower amounts outstanding under our credit facility during fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower interest rates being earned on amounts invested 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from an agreement reached with the taxing authorities in the united kingdom resulting in a reduction in tax expense of approximately  related to foreign tax credits from previous years

table of contents backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal our decline in backlog was due to the amount of projects completed being greater than the amount of orders received 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately million at september   as a result of cash flow provided by operations of approximately million for fiscal the approximately million of cash flow from operations resulted from net income and our continued efforts to manage inventory and billings to customers 
as of september   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at september  we have a million revolving credit facility in the us and an additional million approximately million revolving credit facility in the united kingdom  both of which expire in december as of september   there were no amounts borrowed under these lines of credit 
we also have a million revolving credit facility and a million single advance term loan in canada 
at september   there was no balance outstanding under the canadian revolving credit facility or the canadian term loan 
total long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  totaled million at september   compared to million at september  letters of credit outstanding were million and million at september  and  respectively  which reduce our availability under our credit facilities 
amounts available under the us revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facility in the united kingdom were approximately million and million  respectively  at september  amounts available under the canadian revolving credit facility were approximately million at september  for further information regarding our debt  see notes h and l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our products and services and is impacted as our progress payment terms with our customers are matched with the payment terms with our suppliers 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the increase in fiscal cash flow from operations resulted primarily from net income and our increased efforts to manage inventory and billings to customers 
during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted as accounts receivable and inventories increased due to higher volume as a result of demand for our products and services 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we acquired powell canada for approximately million 
additionally  approximately million was paid to acquire the noncontrolling interest related to our joint venture in singapore powell asia  which has been strategically realigned from an operating entity to a sales and marketing function within powell 
our capital expenditures in fiscal related primarily to the expansion of one of our operating facilities and for upgrades to our enterprise resource planning system erp system 
there were no material proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal  or proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal were primarily from the sale of idled manufacturing facilities and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  as we paid down our canadian revolving line of credit and term loan from the cash flow provided by our operating activities 
net cash 
table of contents used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal because we paid down our us and us revolving lines of credit and the term loan from the cash flow provided by our operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal the primary source of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to borrowings on the us revolving line of credit and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which were used to fund operations and capital expenditures 
contractual and other obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
long term capital operating as of september   debt lease lease payments due by period obligations obligations obligations total less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations as of september   the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was approximately million 
we estimate that none of this will be paid within the next months 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that within the next months unrecognized tax benefits will remain unchanged due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows  if any  associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits 
other commercial commitments we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of september   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
the following table reflects potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event related to our letters of credit in thousands as of september   letters of payments due by period credit less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we also had performance and maintenance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at september  performance and maintenance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook we participate in large capital intensive projects in the oil and gas  petrochemical  utility and transportation markets  which can take several years to plan and execute 
once our customers begin the construction phase  projects are typically completed 
our record revenues in fiscal were driven by the large number and size of capital projects that were planned and initiated over the previous two years 

table of contents however  our backlog of orders going into our fiscal year fiscal is approximately million  a decrease of million from the beginning backlog of orders going into fiscal throughout the second half of fiscal and continuing into fiscal  customer inquiries and requests for proposal activity decreased and an increasing number of our customers cancelled or delayed the start of new capital projects 
we believe these delays resulted from the short term reduction in the demand for oil  uncertainty in the worldwide economy and financial markets  as well as increasing uncertainty as to the impact that potential regulatory changes could have on their business 
growth in demand for energy is expected to continue over the long term 
new infrastructure investments will be needed to ensure the available supply of petroleum products 
new power generation and distribution infrastructure will also be needed to meet the growing demand for electrical energy 
new power generation plants will also be needed to replace the aging facilities across the united states  as those plants reach the end of their life cycle 
a heightened concern for environmental damage  together with the uncertainty of gasoline prices  has expanded the popularity of urban transit systems and pushed ridership to an all time high  which will drive new investment in transit infrastructure 
opportunities for future projects continue  however  the timing of many of these projects is difficult to predict 
the demand for our products and services will increase as investments in large capital intensive infrastructure projects begins to receive funding and support 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
during this period of continued economic and market uncertainty  we will continue to monitor the factors that drive our markets 
we will strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
effects of inflation we have experienced price volatility related to raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel  during the past three years 
fixed price contracts can limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
we anticipate that the volatility in commodity prices could impact our operations in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed primarily based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating 
table of contents the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements  including our estimate of liquidated damages  if any  may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which  among other things  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
the effect of any impairment would be reflected in income loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets and other intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate 
intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that impairment could exist 
the evaluation requires a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss 
the first step of the test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
both steps of the goodwill impairment testing involve significant estimates 
the costs of intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment recorded related to the goodwill associated with the acquisition of powell canada and the ownership in the operations in a joint venture in kazakhstan 

table of contents accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
warranty costs we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical rates applicable to individual product lines 
in addition  specific provisions are made when the costs of such warranties are expected to exceed accruals 
we use past experience and historical claims to determine the estimated liability 
actual results could differ from our estimate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal  international and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that the deferred tax asset recorded as of september   is realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made 
we will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to the valuation allowance recorded related to foreign deferred tax assets 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the 
table of contents us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
derivative financial instruments as part of managing our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we periodically utilize foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable  accounts payable and forecasted cash transactions 
these contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  which is based upon an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow model that takes into account the present value of the future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information  such as foreign currency spot and forward rates  as of the reporting date 
we formally document our hedging relationships  including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
when the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of operations  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported on the same line in the consolidated statements of operations as the hedged item 
in addition  any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges is reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the changes occur 
if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  or it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  we discontinue hedge accounting and any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
on january   we adopted accounting guidance that amended and expanded the disclosure requirements related to derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the guidance is focused on requiring enhanced disclosure on how and why an entity uses derivative instruments and hedging activities  how derivative instruments and related hedging activities are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedging activities affect an entity s cash flows  financial position and performance 
to accomplish the three objectives listed above  we are required to provide qualitative disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments and engaging in hedging activities in the context of our overall risk exposure  quantitative disclosure in tabular format of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance on business combinations 
the guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the accounting guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the guidance is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   and was adopted by us on october  refer to note d for additional information regarding our recent acquisition of powell canada and the impact of this guidance 
in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the accounting guidance also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
the guidance is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   
table of contents and was adopted by us on october  this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  but did change the presentation of noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
the disclosures about plan assets required by this guidance shall be provided for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination due to contingencies 
this guidance clarifies the initial and subsequent recognition  subsequent accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value  if the acquisition date fair value can be reasonably estimated 
if the acquisition date fair value of an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized using the accounting guidance related to accounting for contingencies or the guidance for reasonably estimating losses 
this accounting guidance became effective for us on october  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this update requires new disclosures about significant transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons for these transfers and the reasons for any transfers in or out of level this update also requires a reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition to these new disclosure requirements  this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
for example  this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  rather than each major category of assets or liabilities 
this update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
this update will become effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning after december   our fiscal year  except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  which will become effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning after december   our fiscal year we will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes 
other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance for the milestone method of revenue recognition 
this guidance allows entities to make a policy election to use the milestone method of revenue recognition and provides guidance on defining a milestone and the criteria that should be met for applying the milestone method 
the scope of this guidance is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables 
the guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement  individual milestones and related contingent consideration  information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination 
this guidance is effective prospectively to milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after june  early application and retrospective application are permitted 
we have evaluated this new guidance and have determined that it will not currently have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 

table of contents interest rate risk we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
at september   million was outstanding  bearing interest at approximately per year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of approximately  while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk we have operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars 
our international operations are financed utilizing local credit facilities denominated in local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
a unfavorable change in the us dollar exchange rate  relative to other functional currencies in which we operate  would not materially impact our consolidated balance sheet at september  during fiscal and fiscal  we entered into eight foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of future cash flows on certain long term contracts that are denominated in the british pound sterling 
the contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes
