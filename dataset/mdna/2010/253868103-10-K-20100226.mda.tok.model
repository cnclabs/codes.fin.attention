overview our company 
we were formed on march  and we completed our initial public offering of common stock  or our ipo  on november  we believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify  and have elected to be treated  as a real estate investment trust  or a reit  under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
any reference to our  we and us in this filing includes our company and our predecessor 
our predecessor is comprised of the real estate activities and holdings of global innovation partners llc  or gi partners  which gi partners contributed to us in connection with our ipo 
business and strategy 
our primary business objectives are to maximize i sustainable long term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and ii cash flow and returns to our stockholders  including through the payment of dividends 
we expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of 
table of contents investing in and redeveloping technology related real estate 
a significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for redevelopment and new properties 
we target high quality  strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day to day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants and properties that may be redeveloped for such use 
most of our properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems  multiple power feeds  above standard precision cooling systems  raised floor areas  extensive in building communications cabling and high level security systems 
we focus solely on technology related real estate because we believe that the growth in corporate datacenter adoption and the technology related real estate industry generally will be superior to that of the overall economy 
as of december   we owned an aggregate of technology related real estate properties  excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture  with million rentable square feet including approximately million square feet of space held for redevelopment 
at december   approximately  square feet of our space held for redevelopment was under construction for turn key datacenter space in three us and european markets 
we have developed detailed  standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions to ensure that they meet our financial  technical and other criteria 
we expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy 
we intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow 
we intend to continue to build out our redevelopment portfolio when justified by anticipated returns 
we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties 
debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and our preferred stock 
we currently intend to limit our indebtedness to of our total market capitalization and  based on the closing price of our common stock on december  of  our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately as of december  our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock which may decrease  thereby increasing our debt to total market capitalization ratio  excluding options issued under our incentive award plan  plus the liquidation value of our preferred stock  plus the aggregate value of the units not held by us with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of our common stock and excluding long term incentive units and class c units  plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness 
revenue base 
as of december   we owned properties through our operating partnership  excluding one property held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture 
these properties are mainly located throughout the us  with properties located in europe and one property in canada 
we acquired our first portfolio property in january and have added properties as follows year ended december properties acquired net rentable square feet square feet of space held for redevelopment as of december  properties owned as of december  
table of contents excludes properties sold in and technology center drive march  valley view lane march and east tufts avenue july 
also excludes a leasehold interest acquired in march related to an acquisition made in current net rentable square feet as of december  excludes space held for redevelopment 
we estimate the total net rentable square feet available for lease based on a number of factors in addition to contractually leased square feet  including available power  required support space and common area 
redevelopment space is unoccupied space that requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use 
most often this is shell space 
however  in certain circumstances this may include partially built datacenter space that was not completed by previous ownership and requires a large capital investment in order to build out the space 
the amounts included in this table represent redevelopment space as of december  in the properties acquired during the relevant period 
as of december   the properties in our portfolio were approximately leased excluding million square feet held for redevelopment 
due to the capital intensive and long term nature of the operations being supported  our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases 
as of december   our original average lease term was in excess of years  with an average of seven years remaining 
the majority of our leasing since the completion of our ipo has been at lease terms shorter than years 
our lease expirations through december  are of net rentable square feet excluding space held for redevelopment as of december  operating revenues from properties outside the united states were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  no single foreign country comprised more than of total revenues 
factors which may influence future results of operations global economic conditions recent us  european and other international market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging  with significantly tighter credit conditions and recession in all markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations continuing throughout continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential wide spread and long term recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  global financial and mortgage markets  corporate and consumer debt levels and declining residential and commercial real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us  european and other economies 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment continue to contribute to global volatility of unprecedented levels 
as a result of these conditions  general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital have been and may continue to be adversely affected in all markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
continued turbulence in the us  european and other international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
if these market and economic conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis  access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may adversely affect our and our tenants financial conditions and results of operations 
in addition  our access to funds under our revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us 
we cannot assure you that continuing long term disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures or nationalizations of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an 
table of contents adverse effect on our lenders 
if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us  our business  results of operation  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds  access our revolving credit facility or raise equity capital  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  curtailing development or redevelopment activity  disposing of one or more of our properties  possibly on disadvantageous terms  or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would 
rental income 
the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations 
excluding million square feet held for redevelopment  as of december   the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio was approximately of our net rentable square feet 
the amount of rental income generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
included in our approximately million net rentable square feet  excluding redevelopment space  at december  is approximately  net rentable square feet of space with extensive datacenter improvements that is currently  or will shortly be  available for lease 
since our ipo  we have leased approximately  square feet of similar space 
these turn key datacenters are effective solutions for tenants who lack the expertise or capital budget to provide their own extensive datacenter infrastructure and security 
our expertise in datacenter construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a significant premium over other uses 
negative trends in one or more of these factors  including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions  could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million square feet of redevelopment space  or approximately of the total space in our portfolio  including four vacant properties comprising approximately million square feet 
redevelopment space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use and  in addition  we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for redevelopment space 
we will require additional capital to finance our redevelopment activities  which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us  including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions 
our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to redevelop space and lease redevelopment space at favorable rates  which we may not be able to obtain 
we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant redevelopment space in the future 
economic downturns  including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions  or regional downturns affecting our sub markets or downturns in the technology related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re lease space  otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
as of december  one tenant  lyondell chemical company  or lyondell  was in bankruptcy 
in july  lyondell assumed the lease 
as of december   lyondell leased approximately  square feet of net rentable space at a property in dallas  texas and was current on all of its rental obligations 
scheduled lease expirations 
our ability to re lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations 
in addition to approximately million square feet of available space in our portfolio  which excludes approximately million square feet available for redevelopment as of december   leases representing approximately and of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december  and  respectively 

table of contents market concentration 
we depend on the market for technology based real estate in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional markets can impact our future results 
as of december  our portfolio was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets metropolitan market percentage of total annualized rent silicon valley chicago new york new jersey northern virginia dallas phoenix san francisco los angeles london  england dublin  ireland paris  france other annualized rent is monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of december  multiplied by operating expenses 
our operating expenses generally consist of utilities  property and ad valorem taxes  property management fees  insurance and site maintenance costs  as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases 
in particular  our buildings require significant power to support the datacenter operations contained in them 
many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
however  we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses and real estate taxes under our leases for turn key datacenters 
we also incur general and administrative expenses  including expenses relating to our asset management function  as well as significant legal  accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance  us securities and exchange commission reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance 
we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand 
government authorities and various interest groups are promoting laws and regulations that could limit greenhouse gas  or ghg  emissions due to concerns over contributions to climate change 
in june  the us house of representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation that is intended to cut ghg emissions  create new clean energy jobs and enhance the energy independence of the united states 
this legislation would reduce ghg emissions in the united states through an economy wide cap and trade program 
the us senate is preparing its own version of the legislation that would then need to be reconciled with the house bill 
the state of california has adopted a climate change law and other states in which we operate are considering similar actions 
moreover  the us environmental protection agency  or epa  is moving aggressively to regulate ghg emissions from large stationary sources  including electricity producers  using its own authority under the clean air act 
in addition  since the european union including the united kingdom has been operating under a cap and trade program  which directly affects the largest emitters of ghg  including electricity producers from whom we purchase power 
any additional taxation or regulation of energy use  including as a result of i the legislation that the us congress is currently considering  or other state regulations  ii the regulations that us epa has proposed or may propose in the future  or iii any further reductions in the eu ghg cap could significantly increase our costs  and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants 

table of contents interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt  of which approximately million was mortgage debt subject to interest rate cap or swap agreements  and million was outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
the availability of debt and equity capital has significantly decreased as a result of the circumstances described above under global market and economic conditions 
the effects on commercial real estate mortgages  if available  include  but may not be limited to higher loan spreads  tightened loan covenants  reduced loan to value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments 
potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations  potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets 
increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations  which could further increase our interest expense 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
demand for datacenter space 
our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technology related real estate and datacenter real estate in particular 
a decrease in the demand for datacenter space  internet gateway facilities or other technology related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use 
our redevelopment activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns  including recessions and the other circumstances described above under global market and economic conditions  as well as adverse developments in the corporate datacenter  internet and data communications and broader technology industries 
any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for datacenter space 
reduced demand could also result from business relocations  including to markets that we do not currently serve such as asia 
changes in industry practice or in technology  such as virtualization technology  more efficient or miniaturization of computing or networking devices  or devices that require higher power densities than today s devices  could also reduce demand for the physical datacenter space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable 
in addition  the development of new technologies  the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses  thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases  become insolvent or file for bankruptcy 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report 
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments 
table of contents to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the property and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases  any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for example  if we were to allocate more value to land  there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time 
this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of the value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
asset impairment evaluation 
we review the carrying value of our properties when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate potential impairment may exist 
we base our review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
we estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
capitalization of costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs related to leasing  construction  development and redevelopment  including property taxes  insurance  financing and employee costs relating to space under development 
we capitalize costs on redevelopment space until construction is substantially complete and the space is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements  but no later than 
table of contents one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 
revenue recognition rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in our balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that would be received under the remaining terms of the leases 
many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
however  we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses and real estate taxes under our leases for turn key datacenters 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease  effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized  assuming collection is not considered doubtful 
as discussed above  we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
share based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share based awards 
we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
the calculation of the fair value of share based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility  dividend payments and future company results 
these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period

in conjunction with our formation  gi partners received common units  in exchange for contributing ownership interests in properties to the operating partnership 
also in connection with acquiring real estate interests owned by third parties  the operating partnership issued common units to those sellers 
limited partners who acquired common units in the formation transactions have the right to require the operating partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of the redemption 
alternatively  we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis  subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits  stock dividends  issuance of stock rights  specified extraordinary distributions and similar events

inflation substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above
