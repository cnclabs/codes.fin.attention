business update general while the us economy has showed modest signs of stabilization  consumer demand continues to face considerable headwinds 
the national unemployment rate still stands at nearly according to the us bureau of labor statistics  many real estate markets remain depressed  consumers are redirecting disposal income to reduce debt levels  and according to the bureau of economic analysis  the personal savings rate has increased to approximately  up from just three years ago 
not surprisingly  consumers remain extremely price sensitive and value conscious 
notwithstanding the above economic conditions  we have not experienced significantly lower demand in either of our business segments 
as discussed further below  our businesses have remained more resilient than many other distribution and retail formats and have performed comparatively well given the challenging operating environment 
forward looking  we believe that the ongoing economic malaise  increased regulatory pressures  and the potential for higher excise taxes and fuel prices could adversely affect our sales  gross margins  and operating profits 
additionally  the company is evaluating what impact the new healthcare legislation might have on our businesses 
currently  the ultimate impact of this legislation remains uncertain 
we are  however  confident that our conservative strategy of cost containment and maintaining maximum liquidity positions us well to capture market share  execute strategic acquisitions  open new retail stores  and ultimately reward our shareholders 
business update wholesale segment convenience stores constitute the largest portion of our wholesale segment customer base 
despite depressed economic conditions  convenience store sales remain a vibrant and growing segment in retailing 
according to the september issue of convenience distribution a leading trade publication published by the american wholesale marketers association  in store sales for convenience stores increased during the calendar year  totaling approximately billion 
we believe a number of factors have contributed to the continued success of the convenience store channel 
the number one service characteristic provided by convenience stores is speed 
according to research conducted by national association of convenience stores nacs  the average time it takes consumers to purchase an item in a convenience store and depart is between and minutes 
with over  locations at the end of the calendar year  convenience stores outnumbered all other competing sales channels supermarkets  drug stores  tobacco outlets  and mass merchant dollar stores combined  and have become a destination of choice for time starved customers 
additionally  because convenience stores dominate a number of product categories  they have become an unavoidable part of day to day life for many americans 
for example  during the calendar year convenience stores accounted for approximately of all fuel sales  of all cigarette sales  and of all cold beer sales 
further  nacs estimates that three out of four american adults drink coffee on a regular basis  creating a significant source of potential repeat traffic for convenience stores 
our company does not sell fuel or beer  
table of contents however  cigarettes  food  and other beverages ie coffee represent some of our best selling product categories and benefit from the high traffic generated by convenience stores 
while the convenience store channel continues to prosper  a number of significant trends and challenges exist for the wholesale distributors who serve them 
industry consolidation economies of scale for both convenience stores and wholesale distributors are rapidly becoming a necessary ingredient to a company s ability to compete successfully 
accordingly  both wholesale distributors and convenience stores are consolidating 
while this creates opportunities for our company to acquire smaller competitors  we also face a greater risk that our customers may be acquired by convenience store chains not serviced by us 
demand for cigarettes the sale of cigarettes represent approximately of in store sales for convenience stores according to nacs and represented approximately of our consolidated revenue during fiscal the demand for cigarettes has been decreasing since the s due to a general decline in the number of smokers in the united states and the impact of legislative actions such as smoking bans and higher state and federal excise taxes 
additionally  during fiscal the manufacturing  distribution  marketing  and sale of cigarette and tobacco products was placed under the authority of the fda 
to date  the regulatory actions undertaken by the fda have been primarily targeted at cigarette manufacturers and retailers 
however  future regulatory actions by the fda could further depress consumer demand for tobacco products 
based on these factors  we believe the demand for cigarettes will continue to decline 
food service in an effort to replace declining cigarette revenues and to counter increased competition from other retail formats  the convenience store industry has been remaking itself in recent years  placing a bigger emphasis on food service 
the emphasis on quick service  restaurant styled offerings such as on the go meals  bundled value meal concepts  and expanded beverage and coffee bars  have proven effective in many markets and will be an important category for convenience stores going forward 
technology convenience stores increasingly are relying on technology to manage their business and to effectively compete with other distributors 
capabilities such as inventory scanning  electronic price books  sku rationalization  category management  maximizing manufacturer promotions  and access to robust management reporting are becoming competitive differentiators 
while the convenience store industry is undergoing a number of structural changes ie consolidation  diversifying away from tobacco products  increasing reliance on technology etc  we believe this retailing channel will remain attractive into the foreseeable future given its established footprint 
during the past several years we have proactively implemented initiatives specifically aimed at assisting our customers transition through these structural shifts 
we also believe these same structural changes will create additional opportunities for us to acquire smaller distributors who lack the expertise or resources to offer these expanded services to their convenience stores customers 
business update retail segment the retail health food industry has grown significantly over the past decade as the demand for non processed natural products pesticide free  hormone free  and non genetically modified has grown 
according to the june issue of the natural foods merchandiser nfm  sales for all types of natural products grew to approximately billion during the calendar year 
nfm estimates that approximately of these sales were made through independent natural food retailers such as our retail stores  through conventional mass market retailers  and through all other retail channels internet  mail order  multi level marketing etc we believe a number of key factors have influenced the demand for natural products including heightened awareness about the role that food and nutrition play in long term health  increasing concerns over food safety due to the presence of pesticide residues  growth hormones  and artificial ingredients found in foods purchased through traditional retail outlets  
table of contents growing focus on the impact of chemical additives included in consumer products such as household cleaning agents  the impact of chemicals used in consumer goods on the environment  particularly the potential for water and soil contamination  and an aging population with a desire to maintain good health and a high quality of life 
the depth of the economic meltdown over the past several years has tested the natural products industry  which is characterized by higher price points and niche specialty products 
as reported by nfm  however  the industry not only survived but managed to grow  recording overall sales growth of for the calendar year 
in fact  certain natural food product categories such as packaged grocery  produce  and vitamins enjoyed double digit sales growth during the calendar year  benefiting from a shift in household budgets from dining out to dining in  and the overall desire to maintain good health 
while natural foods remain one of the fastest growing categories in food retailing  the severity of the economic downturn  particularly in florida  has slowed sales growth for our retail stores 
we believe a loyal customer following and their commitment to healthy lifestyles and environmental sustainability have helped us maintain a strong and profitable business 
both chamberlin s market caf and akin s natural foods market have had a local market presence for over years affording them tremendous brand recognition in the area of natural products 
despite slowing sales  during fiscal we were able to improve our gross margins  control operating expenses  and increase operating income as compared to fiscal during fiscal  many conventional supermarkets reduced the fringe product categories they carried  including natural products 
this inventory stocking change by supermarkets allowed us to obtain improved pricing from our suppliers and increase gross margins 
forward looking  we will continue to face a highly competitive environment based on the expansion of both regional and national chains 
notwithstanding these challenges  we believe our health food stores continue to offer a unique value proposition  carrying product lines not readily found in other stores and coupled with highly trained store associates who are passionate about the products we offer 
as the economy recovers and consumer confidence improves  we believe consumer preferences towards natural products will increase 
we believe that these considerations  combined with aging demographics  will make our retail health foods stores an attractive portion of our overall business into the future

these incentives totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal amounts calculated based on actual change in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents sales changes in sales are driven by two primary components i changes to selling prices  which are largely controlled by our product suppliers  and excise taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products by various states  and ii changes in the volume of products sold to our customers  either due to a change in purchasing patterns resulting from consumer preferences or the fluctuation in the comparable number of business days in our reporting period

gross profit in our wholesale segment increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  our gross margins benefited by million due to the gross profit generated by the discount distributors acquisition  million due to improved gross margins in our cigarette and tobacco categories  and million due to changes in sales volume and promotional allowances 
these increases in gross margins were partially offset by million decrease in gross margins attributable to the benefit of tobacco price increases recognized during the prior fiscal year 
gross profit for the retail segment increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to improved gross margins and the addition of our new retail store in tulsa  oklahoma

table of contents interest expense fiscal vs 
fiscal continuing operations fiscal interest expense decreased million as compared to fiscal this change was principally related to lower interest rates and average borrowings on the company s credit facility 
in fiscal  the company s average interest rates and average borrowings on its revolving credit facility were and million lower  respectively  as compared to fiscal discontinued operations fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal  trinity springs  inc tsi  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and crystal paradise holdings  inc cph completed a transaction in which cph exchanged a million note receivable plus million in accrued interest due from tsi  for the operating assets of tsi 
the company recorded a million pre tax gain million after tax in conjunction with the transaction  which included the recognition of a million deferred gain attributable to a previously executed mutual release and settlement agreement between the company  tsi  and cph 
the million gain has been reflected in the statement of operations as a component of discontinued operations 
simultaneous with the closing of the cph transaction discussed above  the company fully settled and satisfied million in related party notes payable plus million in accrued interest due from tsi  in exchange for cash payments of approximately million 
the company recorded a million pre tax gain million after tax related to this transaction  which has been reflected in the statements of operations as a component of discontinued operations 
a summary of discontinued operations is as follows dollars in millions year ended september operating loss interest expense gain on asset disposal and debt settlement income tax expense gain from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources overview general 
the company requires cash to pay operating expenses  purchase inventory  and make capital investments 
in general  the company finances its cash flow requirements with cash generated from operating activities and credit facility borrowings 
operating activities 
during fiscal  the company generated cash of approximately million from operating activities 
the cash generated resulted from higher overall earnings  a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable 
these items were partially offset by an increase in prepaid and other current assets and a decrease in income taxes payable 
our variability in cash flows from operating activities is dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  periodically we have inventory buy in opportunities which offer more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we may have to hold inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates a cash outflow from operating activities which we expect to reverse in later periods 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our peak time of operations  we generally carry higher amounts of inventory to ensure high fill rates and customer satisfaction 
investing activities 
the company used approximately million of cash during fiscal for investing activities  primarily related to capital expenditures for property and equipment and the acquisition of discount distributors 

table of contents financing activities 
the company used cash of million for financing activities during fiscal of this amount  million related to net payments on the company s credit facility  and million related to payments on long term debt  and million related to dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
offsetting these items was million related to the exercise of stock options 
cash on hand working capital 
at september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million 
this compares to cash on hand of million and working capital of million at september credit agreement the company has a credit agreement the facility with bank of america  which includes the following significant terms a january  maturity date and a million revolving credit limit 
the facility bears interest at either the bank s prime rate or at libor plus basis points  at the election of the company 
the facility provides for an additional million of credit available for certain inventory purchases 
these advances bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus one quarter of one percent per annum and are payable within days of each advance 
lending limits that are subject to accounts receivable and inventory limitations 
an unused commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum on the difference between the maximum loan limit and average monthly borrowings 
secured by collateral including all of the company s equipment  intangibles  inventories  and accounts receivable 
provides that the company may not pay dividends on its common stock in excess of per share on an annual basis 
the facility includes a prepayment penalty equal to one half of one percent of the original maximum loan limit million if the company prepays the entire facility or terminates the credit agreement on or before january  the facility includes a financial covenant which requires the company to maintain a minimum debt service ratio of to as measured by the previous twelve month period then ended 
the company was in compliance with this covenant at september the amount available for use on the facility at any given time is subject to a number of factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances that fluctuate day to day 
based on our collateral and loan limits as defined in the facility agreement  the credit limit of the facility at september was million  of which million was outstanding  leaving million available 
at september  the revolving portion of the company s facility balance bore interest based on the bank s prime rate and various short term libor rate elections made by the company 
the average interest rate was at september during fiscal  our peak borrowings under the facility were million and our average borrowings and average availability were million and million  respectively 
our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels increase because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on collateralized assets 

table of contents cross default and co terminus provisions the company s owned real estate in bismarck  nd  quincy  il  and rapid city  sd  and certain warehouse equipment in the rapid city  sd warehouse is financed through term loans with marshall and ilsley bank m i  which is also a participant lender on the company s revolving line of credit 
the m i loans contain cross default provisions which cause all loans with m i to be considered in default if any one of the loans where m i is a lender  including the revolving credit facility  is in default 
there were no such cross defaults at september in addition  the m i loans contain co terminus provisions which require all loans with m i to be paid in full if any of the loans are paid in full prior to the end of their specified terms 
redemption of series c convertible preferred stock during fiscal  the holder of the company s series c convertible preferred stock redeemed all  shares of the issuance 
the series c issuance had been outstanding since  paid a dividend of per annum  and was convertible into  shares of common stock 
the company paid the liquidation value  or million  plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to fully redeem all of the outstanding shares 
the redemption was funded by our credit facility and satisfied all of the company s obligations under the series c convertible preferred stock agreement 
dividends payments the company paid cash dividends of  or per common share in fiscal and  or per common share in fiscal the company also paid cash dividends on its convertible preferred stock of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other the company has several capital leases for office and warehouse equipment 
at september  the outstanding balances on the capital leases totaled approximately million 
the company has issued a letter of credit for million to its workers compensation insurance carrier as part of its self insured loss control program 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity risk the company s liquidity position is significantly influenced by its ability to maintain sufficient levels of working capital 
for our company and industry in general  customer credit risk and ongoing access to bank credit heavily influence liquidity positions 
the company s credit facility with bank of america expires january  we believe the company continues to have a strong working relationship with bank of america and has maintained compliance with all related debt covenants 
however  no assurances can be given that our credit facility with bank of america will be renewed on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk or fuel costs 
accordingly  significant price movements in these areas can and do impact the company s profitability 
the company believes its liquidity position going forward will be adequate to sustain operations 
however  a precipitous change in market conditions could materially impact the company s future revenue stream as well as its ability to collect on customer accounts receivable balances and secure bank credit 

table of contents other matters critical accounting estimates general the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a daily basis and regularly assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
market conditions we consider a broad range of industry trends and macro economic issues which may impact the creditworthiness of our customers 
inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories primarily consist of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products we carry  there is a risk that inventory may become impaired because it has become unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete  or because it has been discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
we may also discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management s evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 

table of contents depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets that were acquired in business combinations 
fixed assets and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill is not amortized 
impairment of segment reporting units is measured in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
the reporting units are valued using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the company recorded no impairment charges in either fiscal or fiscal nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company s long lived assets 
in regard to the company s impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management s estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses 
assumptions and approach used 
for fixed assets  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
in evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets  we primarily use an income based approach discounted cash flow method in addition to both public and private company information 
a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management s evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
insurance the company s insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator  which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on analysis and consultation with our third party administrator  our experience is such that we have a minimum of a one month lag period in which claims are reported 
workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior years loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we utilize the assistance of our insurance agent to trend and develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
our insurance agent uses standard insurance industry loss development models 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on a periodic basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a related valuation allowance as appropriate 
in performing our evaluation  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position  historical financial information  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale segment when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers when earned under established program requirements 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 
our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future
