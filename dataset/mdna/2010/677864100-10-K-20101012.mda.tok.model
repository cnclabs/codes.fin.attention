item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and  to a lesser extent  other sorbent materials 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups retail and wholesale products group and business to business products group 
each operating segm ent is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
consolidated net income was  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a decrease from net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income was negatively impacted by a decrease in tons sold for both of our operating segments 
net income was positively impacted by the mix of products sold  with a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products  and by certain lower costs 
our diversified product offerings helped sustain our business through a challenging economic environment that impacted demand for our products during fiscal lower segment operating income for the retail and wholesale products group reflected the negative impact of wal mart s decision to carry a reduced number of cat litter brands in august the ongoing slump in the manufacturing and automotive industries further reduced demand for our industrial absorbents 
higher segment operating income for the business to business products group  however  resulted from increased demand for certain of our fluids purification and animal health products in both domestic and some foreign markets 
our consolidated gross margin improved during fiscal due in part to a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products and significantly lower costs for natural gas used to dry our clay 
our consolidated balance sheet remained strong during fiscal year cash and cash equivalents increased  not withstanding cash payments for required debt payments  investment in capital assets  treasury stock repurchases and increased dividend payments 
during fiscal  we continued our commitment to create value from sorbent minerals 
we put forth considerable effort on our new engineered granule agricultural chemical carrier product and on our recently introduced enterosorbent animal health products 
we were also committed to our established products through increased product promotion of our branded cat litter 
in addition  our research and development center worked on both new product development and improvements to existing products 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a decrease from net sales of  in fiscal the decline in net sales was driven by our retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal fiscal net income was negatively affected by fewer tons sold  however  increased sales of higher margin products and lower costs for natural gas used to dry our clay positively impacted this year s results 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income declined as a reduction in tons sold prevailed over the benefit of lower costs 
the business to business products group s segment operating income improved as increased sales of higher margin products outweighed the impact of fe wer tons sold 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal increased sales of higher margin products in fiscal more than offset a decrease in tons sold for the group compared to fiscal net sales of fluid purification and animal health and nutrition products increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter and agricultural chemical carrier products decreased 
net sales of fluid purification products increased from fiscal  with a increase in tons sold 
sales to new customers and a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products contributed to the higher fluid purification products net sales 
sales in some export markets improved in part due to a weaker us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  which ma de our products more competitive in the global marketplace 
a decline in the quality of oil from this year s soybean crop also resulted in increased demand for our fluid purification products 
in addition  sales of our fluid purification products used in the biodiesel industry and in palm oil processing increased compared to fiscal net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose in fiscal higher sales of our enterosorbent animal health products  which were introduced during fiscal  overcame a decline in sales of our traditional animal health and nutrition products 
increased net sales of these products were partially offset by a decline in net sales of our agricultural chemical carriers in fiscal compared to fiscal the agricultural chemical carriers market continued to experience economic challenges  which resulted in fewer tons sold 
economic conditions and price competition impacted net sales of our flowability aid product used in animal feed  which decli ned in fiscal in addition  our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased  with fewer tons sold 
net sales were adversely affected by a lower net selling price during most of fiscal  however  the net selling price increased in april under our agreement with clorox 
both the loss of a small co packaging customer during the latter part of fiscal and a decline in the coarse cat litter market also contributed to the decreased net sales and tons sold 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this increase was driven primarily by a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products 
the group s combined packaging  freight and material costs in fiscal were comparable with fiscal  as lower packaging and freight costs were offset by higher material costs 
packaging costs declined approximately due primarily to price fluctuations for resin and paper commodities used in packaging materials 
freight costs decreased approximately due primarily to changes in the price of diesel fuel and the cost of ocean freight 
material costs increased as the negative cost impact of fewer tons produced at some of our manufacturing facilities prevailed ov er the benefit of lower energy related costs in our mining and manufacturing processes 
the group s selling and administrative expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  including higher sales bonuses and commissions based on the improved operating results 
fiscal selling and administrative expenses also included additional costs for personnel  market research  product promotion and technical services related to our new agricultural engineered granule product  which more than offset the decrease in similar costs related to our animal health enterosorbent products 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the decline in net sales was driven by lower tons sold  a lower average net selling price and a lower proportion of sales from higher margin products 
the group s total tons sold decreased compared fiscal cat litter net sales were down approximately compared to fiscal due primarily to lower tons sold 
the average net selling price for cat litter declined in part due to increased trade spending for product promotions  which were deducted from net sales  and a lower proportion of sales from higher margin products 
net sales of branded cat litter decreased due primarily to fewer tons sold 
wal mart began to carry a reduced number of cat litter brands in a ugust during the third quarter of fiscal  wal mart reinstated our branded scoopable litter in a limited number of stores  however  the new store count remains materially reduced from the store count at the end of fiscal incremental net sales at customers other than wal mart and increased marketing to promote brand awareness partially offset the overall sales decline 
net sales of private label cat litter decreased compared to fiscal due to fewer tons sold 
the reduction in tons sold was due primarily to a continued overall decline in the coarse cat litter category 
in contrast  sales of cat litter box liners increased due primarily to increased distribution to an existing customer 
net sales of industrial absorbents decreased compared to fiscal tons sold decreased due primarily to continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing and automotive industries 
see foreign operations below for further information regarding our foreign subsidiaries results 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to the lower net sales described above that prevailed over a decrease of approximately for the group s combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
packaging costs decreased approximately due to price fluctuations for resin and paper commodities 
freight costs decreased approximately due primarily to changes in the price of diesel fuel 
the decline in packaging and freight costs was partially offset by a increase in material costs 
material costs increased as the negative cost impact of lower tons produced at some of our manufacturing facilities prevailed over the benefit of lower energy related costs in our mining and manufacturing processes 
the group s selling  gen eral and administrative expenses increased compared to fiscal due primarily to increased advertising costs and broker commissions  which were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal gross profit was positively impacted by increased sales of higher margin products and lower costs for packaging  freight and fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
the cost of fuel was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal we use natural gas  fuel oil and coal in the manufacturing process to operate kilns that dry our clay 
gross profit for fiscal  however  was negatively impacted by an increase in non fuel manufacturing costs per ton produced  which included depreciation and amortization 
this cost increase per ton was driven primarily by fewer tons produced and increased expenditures for employee benefits and repairs 
many of the other non fuel manufacturing costs  such as salaries and certain labor costs  and depre ciation  were relatively consistent with fiscal levels  despite the reduced number of tons produced  due to their generally fixed nature 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the discussion of the groups operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a higher estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual and higher employee postretirement benefit costs 
the higher incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
the postretirement benefit costs are based on actuarial calculations as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower costs for outside legal services  reduced spending for research and development and lowe r stock option compensation expense 
research and development costs were lower compared to fiscal as fewer new products were in the development stage 
stock option compensation was lower as more stock options became fully vested and no new options were issued 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding and the capitalized interest expense for a new product related capital project 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to higher royalty income  miscellaneous investment income and insurance proceeds 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due to utilization of prior period alternative minimum tax credits 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from fiscal year end balances due primarily to higher cash and cash equivalents and deferred income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by lower investment in short term securities  accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses 
the changes in current assets are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  due primarily to purchases of land and machinery and equipment and increased construction in progress 
these increases were partially offset by additional accumulated depreciation 
other noncurrent assets decreased  due to a reduction in a lease receivable and amortization of intangible assets  which were partially o ffset by an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on key employees 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
noncurrent liabilities decreased  or  due primarily to schedule payments that reduced long term debt 
this decrease was partially offset by higher accruals for pension and postretirement health benefits  deferred compensation and reclamation costs for mining properties 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on pension and postretirement health benefit plans 
deferred compensation accruals increased due to new deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
the higher reclamation liability is the result of ongoing mining activities and acquisi tion of mining property during fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal both our retail and wholesale products group and our business to business products group contributed to the net sales increase 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal the retail and wholesale products group contributed to the improved net income as higher average net selling prices overcame lower volume and increased costs  however  in the business to business products group the lower volume and higher costs prevailed over higher average net selling prices 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal higher average net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix provided for increased sales in fiscal despite lower tons sold for the group compared to fiscal net sales of co packaged cat litter  animal health and nutrition and agricultural chemical carrier products all increased  while net sales of fluids purification and sports related products decreased 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were up in fiscal a increase in tons sold due to product improvements and a higher average net selling price more than offset the loss of a small co package customer during fiscal net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose due prim arily to increased average net selling prices and the introduction of new enterosorbent animal health products 
net sales of agricultural chemical carriers were up approximately due primarily to a higher average net selling price that more than offset approximately lower tons sold 
agricultural chemical carriers tons sold declined in the agricultural and the lawn and garden markets due primarily to the poor economy 
net sales of bleaching earth and fluid purification products were down from fiscal as a decline in tons sold outweighed a higher average net selling price 
the lower tons sold for bleaching earth products resulted from a weak global economy and a good quality soybean crop  which required less bleaching clay to process the oil 
sales of our baseball related products declined due to the negative impact of economic conditions on municipalities and other recreational baseball customers 
the business to business products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal approximately higher combined materials  packaging and freight costs more than offset a higher average net selling price 
materials costs increased approximately due to the higher cost for fuel used to dry our clay based products compared to the prior fiscal year 
freight costs were approximately higher compared to fiscal although diesel fuel and ocean freight prices declined  particularly in the later part of fiscal  the average cost for fiscal was greater than for fiscal conversely  packaging costs declined approximately due primarily to lower costs of paper used in packaging 
selling and administrative expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to marketing and promotional activities for our new enterosorbent animal health product 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the group s net sales growth was driven by increased average net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix that overcame a decrease in tons sold 
net sales of cat litter products increased approximately in fiscal private label cat litter net sales increased approximately due to higher average net selling prices accompanied by a increase in tons sold 
branded cat litter net sales also increased approximately due to a higher average net selling price that offset a decline in tons sold 
branded coarse cat litter tons sold declined  however  our branded scoopable cat litter tons sold increased as a result of new natural products and marketing programs 
net sales of domestic industrial absorbents were flat as a higher average net selling price offset a decline in tons sold due to poor economic conditions in the manufacturing and automotive industries 
net sales of our foreign subsidiaries decreased with a decline in tons sold 
both our united kingdom and canadian subsidiaries have been negatively impacted by unfavorable local currency fluctuations compared to the us dollar and the worldwide economic slowdown 
see foreign operations below for further information regarding our foreign subsidiaries results 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal a higher average net selling price overcame an approximate increase in combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
packaging costs increased approximately due primarily to higher resin costs 
material costs increased approximately due primarily to the higher cost for fuel used to dry our clay based products compared to the prior fiscal year 
freight costs were less than the prior fiscal year as lower diesel prices reduced domestic freight costs  particularly in the later part of fiscal selling and administrative expenses were greater in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal advertising costs increased due to several marketing campaigns to enhance our brand awareness 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal cost of sales for fiscal was reduced by  as a result of the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit improved in fiscal due primarily to a higher average net selling price  which overcame increased manufacturing and packaging costs 
the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal non fuel manufacturing costs  including depreciation and amortization  increased over the same period of the prior fiscal year 
significant manufacturing cost increases were in purchased materials  repairs  labor and non kiln fuel 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the discussion of the groups operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to our operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses were lower in fiscal due primarily to lower expenses for the estimated incentive bonus  research and development and stock option compensation 
the lower fiscal incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each year 
research and development costs were lower as we moved further through the development cycle for several new products 
stock option compensation was lower as more stock options became fully vested and no new options were issued 
these lower expenses were partia lly offset by higher pension and rent expenses 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates and lower average investment balances 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal other income in fiscal included income relating to a lease arrangement with a co packaging partner 
other income in fiscal included expenses associated with examinations by regulatory agencies 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal due to a lower deduction for mining depletion due to reduced tonnage and an unfavorable tax impact from the results of foreign operations 
total assets increased  during fiscal current assets decreased  or  from the fiscal year end balances primarily due to decreased investments in treasury securities and accounts receivable 
these decreases were partially offset by increased cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses 
these changes are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  due primarily to capital projects related to new product development at our manufacturing facilities and the purchase of land 
other noncurrent assets increased  from fiscal due to a higher deferred tax asset partially offset by a decrease in a lease receivable 
total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal current liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
noncurrent liabilities increased  due primarily to higher accruals for pension and postretirement health benefits and deferred compensation partially offset by a reduction in long term debt due to scheduled payments 
the increased pension and postretirement health benefit accruals were driven by the actuarially calculated benefit obligations and lower pension asset values as of july  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on employee benefit plans 
deferred compensation accruals increased due to new deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess o f payouts 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year tons sold increased in our canadian subsidiary  but decreased in our united kingdom subsidiary 
net sales of our canadian subsidiary increased due to higher sales of industrial products and a favorable exchange rate for the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar was about stronger on average against the us dollar during fiscal compared fiscal  which resulted in higher sales values after translation to us dollars 
partially offsetting the higher canadian net sales was a decline in net sales of industrial absorbents by our united kingdom subsidiary due primarily to the loss of a key distributor 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the decrease in the net loss was due in part to the higher sales for our canadian subsidiary  which more than offset the sales decline of our united kingdom subsidiary 
in addition  the currency translation loss reported by our foreign operations in fiscal was significantly less than the loss reported in fiscal the british pound declined significantly in value compared to the us dollar during fiscal  which resulted in a substantial currency translation loss 
during fiscal  the british pound did not fluctuate considerably in value compared to the us dollar 
negatively impacting the foreign subsidiaries operating results were higher packaging and freight costs in our canadian subsidiary 
packaging cos ts increased due to fluctuations in the cost of polystyrene and freight costs included a multi year withholding tax charge on our leased railcars 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the decrease is primarily due to lower fixed assets that resulted from the sale of a building in our united kingdom subsidiary and lower accounts receivable and inventories 
these decreases were partially offset by higher cash and cash equivalents balances 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales were  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal net sales and tons sold decreased in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
industrial absorbent sales were down for both subsidiaries as the worldwide economic slowdown impacted sales through reduced orders 
aggressive competition in the canadian cat litter market also resulted in some reduced sales and the loss of a customer 
in addition  the british pound was approximately weaker and the canadian dollar was approximately weaker against the us dollar for fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted in lower sales values after translation to us dollars 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  a decrease of  from the  net income reported in fiscal the lower tons sold and currency impacts described above contributed to the net loss  along with increased material and freight costs 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  most of the decrease in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july   there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with harris na the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  net cash provided by operations was  an increase of  from fiscal  due primarily to changes in working capital  a decrease in other assets and an increase in other liabilities 
other assets decreased due primarily to payments received on a lease receivable and amortization of intangible assets 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance on key employees 
other liabilities increased due primarily to higher accruals for postretirement benefits  deferred compensation and reclamation costs for mining properties 
the postretirement benefits are based on actuarially calculated benefit obligations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee benefit plans 
deferred compensation increased due to conti nued deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payout 
the higher reclamation liability is the result of ongoing mining activities and acquisition of mining property during fiscal in fiscal  net cash provided by operations was  an increase of  from fiscal  due primarily to an increase in other liabilities and changes in working capital 
other liabilities increased in fiscal due to higher postretirement benefit liabilities based on actuarially calculated benefit obligations and lower pension asset values as of july  deferred compensation also increased due to continued deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
the changes in the primary components of working capital and other accounts that impacted operating cash flows for these years are as follows accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the decrease was due primarily to lower fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the decrease was due primarily to lower fiscal fourth quarter sales  particularly during the month of july  compared to fourth quarter sales 
inventories were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end finished goods and packaging inventories were down due to lower sales requirements 
lower packaging costs also contributed to lower packaging inventories 
inventories were up  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due to a higher finished goods inventory that offset a lower packaging inventory 
accounts payable increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher income taxes payable 
income taxes payable increased due to current year tax accruals and increased deferred tax assets related to accrued expenses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
accounts payable decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end as the result of fewer purchases due to lower sales and production levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal changes in all periods are also subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 
accrued expenses increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses included a higher discretionary bonus accrual for fiscal accrued freight and other accrued operating expenses increased due to timing of payments 
accrued trade promotions and advertising increased due to more marketing programs 
accrued expenses decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued freight decreased  and other accrued expenses decreased  at fiscal year end due primarily to lower sales and production levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  cash provided by net dispositions of short term investment securities was  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the additional proceeds from disposition of short term securities were used to fund higher debt payments and capital expenditures  including projects related to new product development at our manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures included  to purchase land and mineral rights near our georgia production plant 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  net dispositions of short term investment securities were  compared to net purchases of short term investment securities of  in fiscal in fiscal  proceeds from disposition of investment securities were used to fund higher requirements for capital expenditures and debt payments 
in addition  during fiscal we modified our investment strategy to allocate a greater portion of our financial resources to investments versus cash 
purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are also subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
capital expenditures were  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal significant capital projects related to new product development at our manufacturing facilities and the purchase of land used cash in fiscal during fiscal  we also used  to purchase strategic intangible assets in the retail and wholesale products group 
net cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cash was used in fiscal primarily for purchases of treasury stock  payments of dividends and principal payments on long term debt 
in fiscal  payments for purchases of treasury stock and for dividends were  and  higher  respectively  compared to fiscal  however  payments on long term debt were  lower in accordance with our debt agreements 
in addition  proceeds from re issuance of treasury stock and issuance of new common stock during fiscal were  higher as a result of more stock option exercises 
cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we used cash in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt  dividends and purchases of treasury stock 
payments on long term debt were  higher in fiscal in accordance with our debt agreements 
cash used to purchase treasury stock was  higher in fiscal dividends paid were  higher in fiscal due to a dividend increase 
in addition  proceeds from re issuance of treasury stock and issuance of new common stock during fiscal were  lower as a result of less stock option exercise activity 
other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
cash and investment balances fluctuated due to normal business operations 
as part of the normal course of business  we guarantee certain debts and trade payables of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these arrangements are made at the request of the subsidiaries creditors  as separate financial statements are not distributed for the wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of july   the value of these guarantees was  of lease liabilities 
we have a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris na harris which will expire december  the credit agreement provides that we may select a variable rate based on either harris prime rate or a libor based rate  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio  or a fixed rate as agreed between us and harris 
at july   the variable rates would have been for the harris prime based rate or for the libor based rate 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  and  there were no outstanding bo rrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with its covenants 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
we expect cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to be slightly higher than capital expenditures in fiscal our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any ne w business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     interest on long term    debt capital leases    operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations     the unconditional purchase obligations represent forward purchase contracts we have entered into for a portion of our natural gas fuel needs for fiscal as of july   the remaining purchase obligation was  for  mmbtu for fiscal these contracts were entered into in the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a contribution of  to our defined benefit pension plan 
we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for certain information regarding the potential impact of financial market fluctuations on pension plan assets and future funding contributions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than after committed year years years years other commercial commitments     the obligations above are open purchase orders primarily for packaging and other ingredients used in our products 
the expected timing of payments of these obligations is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such asset s 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies annually to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assu mptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
we record for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer account is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  however  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the obsolescence reserve not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our mining process we remove overburden non usable material and perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the f irst quarter of the fiscal year and we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions 
we routinely commit to one time or ongoing trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending programs 
we recorded liabilities of  and  for trade promotions at july  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock options and restricted stock issued under our long term incentive plans in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date and the recognition in the financial statements of the related compensation expense over the appropriate vesting period 
the fair value of stock based compensation was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
this method requires management to make certai n estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used 
we recognized share based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
these amounts include expense related to stock option grants and restricted stock 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement health benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement health benefit am ounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate was the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
ou r expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the tax effect of the expected reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the pe riod of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could affect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at july  has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these credits will not be realized

new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted guidance under asc  financial instruments  which required disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information 
we already comply with the provisions of this accounting standard for our annual reporting  therefore  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted guidance under asc  earnings per share  which required unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid to be considered participating securities and to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
under the provisions of this standard  our unvested restricted stock awards were considered participating securities 
upon adoption we were required to retrospectively adjust earnings per share data to conform to this standard 
accordingly  we have applied this standard for computation of earnings per share fo r all periods presented 
the effect of the retrospective adoption of the new accounting standard on the fiscal year and reported eps data was as follows basic common basic class b common diluted year as as as ended previously as previously as previously as july  reported restated reported restated reported restated in the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted the fasb guidance under asc  subsequent events 
this guidance amended several definitions and removed the requirement for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the adoption of this guidance resulted in revised disclosures and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted the required portions of fasb guidance under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance required enhanced disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs for level and level fair value measurements 
the guidance also required new disclosures about transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
the adoption of this guidance required only enhanced disclosures and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on july   we adopted guidance under asc  compensation retirement benefits  that required expanded disclosure for employers pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets fair value measurements  investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the adoption of this guidance required only enhanced disclosures  which we provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued guidance under asc  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  that requires new disclosures to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables  including credit quality indicators  past due information and modifications of financing receivables 
a rollforward schedule of the allowance for credit losses for the reporting period is also required 
adoption of the guidance regarding disclosures as of the end of a reporting period may result in enhanced disclosures beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending janua ry  adoption of the guidance regarding disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending april  adoption of this guidance may result in enhanced disclosures and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar euro and us dollar canadian dollar  as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
foreign currency denominated accounts receivable is a small fraction of our consolidated accounts receivable 
we are also subject to translation exposure of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
in recent years  our foreign subsidiaries have not generated a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales or net income 
we do not enter into any hedge contracts in an attempt to offset any adverse effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
we believe that the foreign currency fluctuation risk is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to market risk at it relates to the investments of plan assets under our defined benefit pension plan 
the fair value of these assets is subject to change due to fluctuations in the financial markets 
a lower asset value may increase our pension expense and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of future funding contributions 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluids purification  agricultural and animal health markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain throughout the world  but particularly in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we contract for a portion of our anticipated fuel needs using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices 
as of july   we have purchased natural gas contracts representing approximately of our planned kiln fuel needs for fiscal we estimate the weighted average cost of these natural gas contracts in fiscal to be approximately lower than the contracts in fiscal  however  this average will change if we continue to buy natural gas contracts 
all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts  the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market 
please also see item a risk factors above for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
