item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of novel  targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer using our expertise in cancer biology  monoclonal antibodies  highly potent cytotoxic  or cell killing  agents  and the design of linkers that enable these agents to be stably attached to the antibodies while in the blood stream and released in their fully active form after delivery to a cancer cell 
an anticancer compound made using our targeted antibody payload  or tap  technology consists of a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to an antigen target found on cancer cells with multiple copies of one of our proprietary cell killing agents attached using one of our engineered linkers 
its antibody component enables a tap compound to bind specifically to cancer cells that express a particular target antigen  the highly potent cytotoxic agent serves to kill the cancer cell  and the engineered linker controls the release and activation of the cytotoxic agent inside the cancer cell 
our tap technology is designed to enable the creation of highly effective  well tolerated anticancer products 
all of our and our collaborative partners tap compounds currently in preclinical and clinical testing contain either dm or dm as the cytotoxic agent 
both dm and dm  collectively dmx  are our proprietary derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology to develop naked  or non conjugated  antibody anticancer product candidates 

table of contents we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates to specified targets 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are generally entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in addition  under certain agreements we are entitled to research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner s request 
we are reimbursed for our direct and a portion of overhead costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and  under certain collaborative agreements  the reimbursement includes a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include amgen  bayer schering pharma  biogen idec  biotest  genentech a member of the roche group and sanofi aventis 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
details for some of our major and recent collaborative agreements can be found in this k under item  business 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities compared to million in cash and marketable securities as of june  we anticipate that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments  royalties and upfront fees 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any such opportunities presented by additional strategic partners or alternative financing arrangements will be entirely available to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into licensing and development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of monoclonal antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
we follow the provisions of fasb s accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the terms of our agreements contain multiple elements which typically include non refundable license 
table of contents fees  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we evaluate such arrangements to determine if the deliverables are separable into units of accounting and then apply applicable revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting 
agreements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units either on the basis of each unit s fair value or using the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
in october a new accounting standard for the recognition of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables was issued 
this standard provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  our fiscal year 
while we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  this standard may impact us in the event we complete future transactions or modify existing collaborative relationships 
refer to note b  recent accounting pronouncements  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this standard and its impact on us 
at june   we had the following three types of collaborative contracts with the parties identified below exclusive license to use our tap technology and or certain other intellectual property to develop compounds to a single target antigen amgen multiple single target licenses bayer schering pharma single target license biogen idec single target license biotest single target license genentech multiple single target licenses sanofi aventis license to multiple individual targets option agreement for a defined period of time to secure licenses to use our tap technology to develop anticancer compounds to a limited number of targets on established terms broad option agreement amgen sanofi aventis non exclusive license to our humanization technology sanofi aventis generally  the foregoing collaboration agreements provide that we will i at the collaborator s request  manufacture and provide to them preclinical and clinical materials which are reimbursed at our cost  or  in some cases  cost plus a margin  ii earn payments upon the collaborators achievements of certain milestones and iii earn royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or to years after product launch 
royalty rates may vary over the royalty term depending on our intellectual property rights 
we provide technical training and share any process improvements and know how with our collaborators during the research term of the collaboration agreements 

table of contents generally  upfront payments on single target licenses are deferred over the period of our substantial involvement during development 
the determination of the length of this period is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
our employees are available to assist our collaborators during the development of their products 
we estimate this development phase to begin at the inception of the collaboration agreement and conclude at the end of non pivotal phase ii testing 
we believe this period of involvement is  depending on the nature of the license  on average six and one half years 
quarterly  we reassess our periods of substantial involvement over which we amortize our upfront license fees and we make adjustments as appropriate 
in the event that a single target license were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
we defer upfront payments received from our broad option agreements over the period during which the collaborator may elect to receive a license 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement  but are between three and years 
if a collaborator selects an option to acquire a license under these agreements  any option fee is deferred and is recorded over the life of the option  generally to months 
if a collaborator exercises an option and we grant a single target license to the collaborator  we defer the license fee and account for the fee as we would an upfront payment on a single target license  as discussed above 
upon exercise of an option to acquire a license  we would recognize any remaining deferred option fee over the period of our substantial involvement under the license acquired 
in the event a broad option agreement were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
in the event a collaborator elects to discontinue development of a specific product candidate under a single target license  but retains its right to use our technology to develop an alternative product candidate to the same target or a target substitute  we would cease amortization of any remaining portion of the upfront fee until there is substantial preclinical activity on another product candidate and our remaining period of substantial involvement can be estimated 
when milestone fees are specifically tied to a separate earnings process and are deemed to be substantive and at risk  revenue is recognized when such milestones are achieved 
in addition  we recognize research and development support revenue from certain collaboration and development agreements based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research agreement 
deferred revenue substantially represents amounts received under collaborative agreements and not yet earned pursuant to these policies 
where we have no continuing involvement  we will record non refundable license fees as revenue upon receipt and will record revenue upon achievement of milestones by our collaborative partners 
we produce preclinical and clinical materials for our collaborators 
we are reimbursed for our direct costs and a portion of our overhead costs to produce clinical materials 
we recognize revenue on preclinical and clinical materials when the materials have passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
we also produce research material for potential collaborators under material transfer agreements 
additionally  we perform research activities  including developing antibody specific conjugation processes  on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
generally  we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs of producing these materials or providing these services 
we record the amounts received for the preclinical materials produced or services performed as a component of research and development support 
we also develop conjugation processes for materials for later stage testing and commercialization for certain collaborators 
we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs and may receive milestone payments for developing these processes which are recorded as a component of research and development support 

table of contents inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of raw materials in excess of twelve month projected usage that are not supported by firm  fixed collaborator orders and projections at the time of the assessment to be excess 
during fiscal  we obtained additional amounts of dmx from a new supplier 
due to the need to evaluate the process which was developed to prepare such material from this new supplier across multiple batches  we had committed to a level of production which yielded more material than would be required by our collaborators over the next twelve months 
as a result  during the year ended june   we recorded a million charge to research and development expense related to raw material inventory identified as excess 
we also recorded million to write down the raw material inventory purchased during the fiscal year to its net realizable value  which is also included in research and development expense for the year ended june  during fiscal  we obtained additional amounts of dmx from our supplier which yielded more material than would be required by our collaborators over the next twelve months and as a result  we recorded  of charges to research and development expense related to raw material inventory identified as excess 
we also recorded  to write down certain raw material inventory to its net realizable value  which is also included in research and development expense for the year ended june  no similar costs were recorded during the year ended june  our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and the maximum tolerated dose likely to be reached for the compound being evaluated 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual twelve month usage of raw materials varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
reductions in collaborators projections could indicate that we have additional excess raw material inventory and we would then evaluate the need to record further write downs  which would be included as charges to research and development expense 
stock based compensation as of june   the company is authorized to grant future awards under one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc employee  director and consultant equity incentive plan 
the stock based awards are accounted for under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this methodology  the estimated fair value of awards is charged to the statement of operations over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical data as well as current trends 
stock compensation cost incurred during the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately  of stock compensation cost related to the modification of certain outstanding common stock options in accordance with the former chief executive officer s succession plan 

table of contents investment in marketable securities we invest in marketable securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity 
we have classified our marketable securities as available for sale and  accordingly  carry such securities at aggregate fair value 
in accounting for investments  we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary  and if so  we record an impairment charge related to any credit loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
the factors that we consider in our evaluation include the fair market value of the security  the duration and magnitude of the security s decline  and our intent to sell or whether we would more likely than not to be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our results 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  we recorded approximately  and  respectively  in other than temporary impairment charges 
no similar charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended june  we adopted certain provisions of asc topic  investments debt and equity securities  on april  as a result of the adoption of these provisions  during fiscal year we reclassified  of previously recognized other than temporary impairment charges to other comprehensive loss as a cumulative effect adjustment 
fair value of financial instruments as of july   we partially adopted the provisions of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
asc topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
certain provisions of asc topic related to other non financial assets and liabilities were adopted by us on july  and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption  however  this standard may impact us in subsequent periods and require additional disclosures 
fair value is defined under asc topic as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy to measure fair value which is based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable 
this standard is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie financial and non financial and requires enhanced disclosures  including interim and annual disclosure of the input and valuation techniques or changes in techniques used to measure fair value and the defining of the major security types comprising debt and equity securities held based upon the nature and risk of the security 
the fair value of our investments is generally determined from market prices based upon either quoted prices from active markets or other significant observable market transactions at fair value 

table of contents results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million decrease in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower revenues from research and development support  license and milestone fees and clinical materials reimbursement  as discussed below 
the million decrease in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower revenues from research and development support and clinical materials reimbursement  partially offset by higher revenues from license and milestone fees  as discussed below 
research and development support was million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our agreements with our collaborators as shown in the table below 
the decreased research and development support fees in fiscal years and compared to fiscal year is primarily due to a reduction in the amount earned from sanofi aventis with the conclusion of its committed funding obligations in the first half of fiscal also included in research and development support revenue are development fees charged for reimbursement of our direct and overhead costs incurred in producing and delivering research grade materials to our collaborators and for developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators product candidates and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from research and development support from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  research and development support collaborative partner amgen bayer schering pharma biogen idec biotest centocor ortho biotech genentech sanofi aventis other total revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  decreased approximately million to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million

clinical materials reimbursement decreased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of a number of clinical trials including  for certain of these years  those of t dm  ave  sar  sar  biib  bt  as well as preclinical materials in support of the development efforts of certain other collaborators and dmx shipments to certain collaborators in support of development and manufacturing efforts 
the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily related to less clinical material shipped in support of two of our collaborators trials due to various factors  including the dosage schedule and speed of enrollment within the trials 
the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily related to million in revenue recognized from supplying dmx to a collaborator in fiscal year  along with the transfer of t dm to commercial scale production at a third party contract manufacturing organization in fiscal year during fiscal year  sanofi aventis discontinued clinical trial activity for ave we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials plus  for certain programs  a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense  is directly related to the number of clinical trials our collaborators are preparing or have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from 
table of contents the clinical materials  and the supply of clinical grade material to our collaborators for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement revenue and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses our net research and development expenses relate to i research to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas activities pursuant to our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  activities pursuant to our development and license agreements with various other collaborators  activities related to the preclinical and clinical development of lorvotuzumab mertansine  imgn and imgn  process development related to production of the lorvotuzumab antibody and lorvotuzumab mertansine conjugate for clinical materials  process development related to production of imgn conjugate for clinical materials  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  funded development activities with contract manufacturers for the antibody component of imgn  the lorvotuzumab antibody  and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  production costs for the supply of the lorvotuzumab antibody  production costs for the supply of dmx for our and our partners preclinical and clinical activities  operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility  including production of our own and our collaborators clinical materials  process improvements to our tap technology  evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and or in licensed product candidates and technologies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents and linkers 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the year ended june  is million of stock compensation costs compared to million and million of stock compensation costs for fiscal years and  respectively 
the higher stock compensation costs in fiscal are driven by higher stock prices and increases in the number of annual options granted 
clinical trial costs increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and increased  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year additionally  overhead utilization 
table of contents from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators decreased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and decreased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year included in research and development expenses for the year ended june  is  related to raw material inventory identified as excess  as well as  to write down certain raw material inventory to its net realizable value 
included in research and development expenses for the year ended june  is a million charge related to raw material inventory identified as excess and a million charge to write down raw material purchased during that year to its net realizable value 
no similar costs were recorded during fiscal year reserve requirements for excess quantities of dmx are principally determined based on our collaborators forecasted demand compared to our inventory position 
the dmx purchased during fiscal year was produced by a supplier in conjunction with process scale up  resulting in the purchase of quantities of material exceeding anticipated collaborator demand in the next twelve months 
due to lead times required to secure material  process development and the changing requirements of our collaborators  expenses to recognize excess quantities have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
see inventory within our critical accounting policies above for further discussion of our inventory reserve policy 
we are unable to accurately estimate which potential product candidates  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or that we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or prevent our obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other factors  the clinical indications  the timing  size and design of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause unacceptable side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impractical to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and 
table of contents development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development expense research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations total research and development expense research research includes expenses associated with activities to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents for our products and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and decreased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was principally the result of an increase in stock compensation costs 
the decrease in research expense in fiscal year was principally the result of a decrease in salaries and related expenses due to a reorganization of departments in march and july  resulting in lower personnel costs included in research expense for the period

manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and decreased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of i a decrease in overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators  ii an increase in antibody supply and development expenses  and iii an increase in stock compensation costs 
partially offsetting these increases  contract service expense decreased and 
table of contents cost of clinical materials reimbursed decreased 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of i a decrease in supply of dmx and clinical materials to our collaborators  ii a decrease in antibody supply and development expenses  iii a decrease in contract service expenses  and iv a significant decrease in charges incurred related to the write down of raw material inventory 
partially offsetting these decreases  salaries and related expenses increased  depreciation and amortization increased  and overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators decreased 
antibody expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials  as well as our ongoing trials  was million in fiscal year   in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor

table of contents in addition to the above table  we are contractually obligated to make potential future success based regulatory milestone payments in conjunction with certain collaborative agreements 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts 
as a result  these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
further  the timing of any future payment is not reasonably estimable 
as of june   the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under such arrangements is approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  our fiscal year 
while we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  this standard may impact us in the event we complete future transactions or modify existing collaborative relationships 
the provisions of asc topic  consolidation  related to the changes to how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year 
early application is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued guidance related to the milestone method of revenue recognition  which will codify a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice 
under this method  contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after june  but may be adopted as of the beginning of an annual period 
because our current revenue recognition policy for milestone payments is consistent with the fasb s guidance  we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements none 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the contracts are denominated in euros and have maturities of less than one year 
our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions  anticipated transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency  resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts 
generally  these contracts provide that we receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates at specified future dates 
although we are exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by a counterparty  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur
