item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading operator in the automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises at dealership locations and collision service centers in the us and six franchises at three dealerships and two collision centers in the uk we market and sell an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  south carolina and texas in the us and in the towns of brighton  hailsham and worthing in the uk as of december   our retail network consisted of the following three regions with the number of dealerships they comprised i the eastern dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york and south carolina  ii the central dealerships in kansas  oklahoma and texas  and iii the western dealerships in california 
each region is managed by a regional vice president who reports directly to our chief executive officer and is responsible for the overall performance of their regions  as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers that report to them 
each region is also managed by a regional chief financial officer who reports directly to our chief financial officer 
our dealerships in the uk are also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
from january   through december   we have acquired franchises with annual revenues of billion  disposed of or terminated franchises with annual revenues of billion  and been granted five new franchises by our manufacturers 
in alone  we acquired two luxury  two import and one domestic franchise with expected annual revenues of million 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
also during  we disposed of seven domestic and one luxury franchise with annual revenues of million 
we make disposition decisions based principally on the rate of return on our capital investment  the location of the dealership  our ability to leverage our cost structure  the franchise and existing real estate obligations 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the new vehicle sales impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services  as well as our ability to reduce our costs in response to lower sales 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the us  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather 
as a result  our revenues  cash flows and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 

table of contents since september  the us and global economies have suffered from  among other things  a substantial decline in consumer confidence  a rise in unemployment and a tightening of credit availability 
as a result  the retail automotive industry was negatively impacted by decreasing customer demand for new and used vehicles  vehicle margin pressures and higher inventory levels 
in addition  the economic downturn has adversely impacted the manufacturers that supply our new vehicle inventory and some of our parts inventory  particularly the three domestic manufacturers 
excluding the positive impact of the us government sponsored car allowance rebate system cars program on the automotive selling environment during august  consumer demand for new and used vehicles seems to have stabilized 
given the depths of this downturn  a recovery to historically normalized industry selling levels will probably be extended 
in response to this challenging economic environment  we took a number of steps to adjust our cost structure  strengthen our cash balance and improve liquidity 
we implemented significant cost cuts in our ongoing operating structure  to appropriately size our business and allow us to manage through this industry downturn  including wage cuts for our senior management team and board of directors  as well as various other levels  alterations to pay plans  headcount reductions and the elimination or minimization of several other variable expenses to align with current and projected operational results 
specifically related to personnel expenses  we initiated various wage cuts for the board of directors and senior management  as well as for all other corporate employees and various other regional  market and dealership level employees 
in addition  we suspended various employee benefits 
further  we reduced headcount by from the beginning of as it relates to other variable expenses  our cost reductions were primarily related to a decrease in overall advertising levels and a shift to utilization of various in house and email marketing tools  as well as our ability to capitalize on declining media rates 
other variable expense reductions also reflect initiatives designed to reduce software solutions  contract labor  travel and entertainment  delivery and loaner car expenses 
for  these actions generated million in cost savings from levels 
approximately of the cost reductions were personnel related expenses and the remaining are attributable to advertising and other expenses 
during the economic downturn  we have used the cash that we generated from our operations to pay down debt 
most notably  we redeemed a portion of our notes with an aggregate par value of million during the year ended december  to further improve liquidity  we reduced new vehicle inventory levels by million and our parts inventory levels by million during  respectively 
and  we continue to closely scrutinize all planned future capital spending and work closely with our manufacturer partners in this area 
as a result  capital spending  which consisted primarily of required facility maintenance projects  totaled million  down significantly from levels of million 
despite the challenging retail and economic environment  we believe that opportunities exist in the marketplace to maintain or improve profitability  including i focusing on our higher margin parts and service and finance and insurance businesses  ii managing our inventory to meet customer demands  and iii continuing to scrutinize cost reduction initiatives 
efforts designed to maintain and or improve the profitability of our parts and service business focus on marketing efforts  strategic selling and operational efficiencies 
within our finance and insurance business  our profitability initiatives have primarily focused on the minimization of product costs 
as it relates to inventory management  our local management teams are focused on the balance between small inventory supply  which reduces inventory carrying costs but increases the risk of not satisfying customer demand  and large inventory supply  which increases inventory carrying costs but decreases the risk of not satisfying customer demand 
amid the economic turmoil of  chrysler llc chrysler and general motors corporation general motors filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws of the us at that time we owned and operated eight chrysler brand dealerships  all of which contain chrysler  jeep and dodge franchises  and seven general motors brand dealerships  five of which contain chevrolet franchises only and two of which contain buick  pontiac and gmc franchises 
and although both chrysler and general motors terminated a number of their dealer franchise agreements in conjunction with their respective bankruptcies and restructuring efforts  we retained each of our dealership franchise agreements  with the exception of pontiac which is being discontinued as a brand 
while the comprehensive impact on us of the bankruptcies and subsequent business restructurings of chrysler and general motors will not be fully known for some time  we have continued to collect our receivables from both chrysler and general motors and did not experience a significant decline in the valuation of our vehicle and parts inventory through december  
table of contents also  during  chrysler financial and gmac  the two financing subsidiaries of chrysler and general motors  separated from their affiliated manufacturer entities 
as a result  gmac continued to provide services to support the financing of general motors vehicle purchases and assumed support from chrysler financial for the financing of chrysler vehicle purchases 
prior to these events  we relied upon chrysler financial and gmac to finance a portion of the new and used retail vehicle sales for our customers 
we will continue to rely upon gmac for these financing services 
however  the operational and financial impact of the separation of chrysler financial or gmac from their respective affiliated manufacturer and the assumption by gmac of chrysler financial financing support is not predictable at this time  but could be adverse to us 
in january  toyota motor sales  usa  inc toyota temporarily suspended the production and sale of certain models representing about two thirds of their total unit sales in the us and launched a recall to address quality issues on those vehicles 
in the near term  this recall could negatively impact our new and used vehicle sales 
and  longer term  toyota s reputation for quality vehicles could be permanently impaired  despite the efforts of toyota to quickly and effectively address these quality issues 
in contrast  our warranty parts and service business may be bolstered while units in inventory and operation are repaired 
we are unable to estimate the longer term net impact of this recall  but  since toyota brands represented of our unit sales in  it could be materially adverse to our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   we realized a net income of million  or per diluted share  and for the years ended december  and  we realized net loss of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million  or per diluted share  respectively 
in addition to the matters described above  the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and year ended december  asset impairments we recognized a total of million in pretax impairment charges  primarily related to the impairment of vacant properties that were held for sale as of december   as well as other long term assets 
gain on debt redemption in  we redeemed a portion of our notes with an aggregate par value of million and  as a result  recognized an million pretax gain and a proportionate reduction in deferred tax assets relative to unamortized costs of the purchased options acquired in conjunction with the initial issuance 
the cost of the options was deductible for tax purposes as an original issue discount 
in conjunction with these repurchases  million of the consideration was attributed to the repurchase of the equity component of the notes and  as such  was recognized as an adjustment to additional paid in capital  net of income taxes 
income tax benefit we recognized an income tax benefit of million as a result of making a tax election in that reduced income tax liability that we had provided 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt as required by asc topic no 
 debt asc 
year ended december  asset impairments in the third quarter of  we determined that the economic conditions and resulting impact on the automotive retail industry  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the going concern of the domestic automobile manufacturers  indicated the potential for an impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in response to the identification of such triggering events  we performed an interim impairment assessment of our recorded values of goodwill and intangible franchise rights utilizing our valuation model  which consists of a blend between the market and income approaches 
as a result of such assessment  we determined that the fair values of certain indefinite lived intangible franchise rights were less than their respective carrying values and recorded a pretax charge of million  primarily related to our domestic brand franchises 
further  during the third quarter of  we identified potential impairment indicators relative to certain of our real estate holdings  primarily associated with domestic 
table of contents franchise terminations and other equipment  after giving consideration to the likelihood that certain facilities would not be sold or used by a prospective buyer as an automobile dealership operation given market conditions 
as a result  we performed an impairment assessment of these long lived assets and determined that the respective carrying values exceeded their estimated fair market values  as determined by third party appraisals and brokers opinions of value 
accordingly  we recognized an million pretax asset impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual assessment of impairments relative to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result  we identified additional impairments of our recorded value of intangible franchise rights  primarily attributable to the continued weakening of the us economy  higher market risk premiums  the negative impact of the economic recession on the automotive retail industry and the growing uncertainty surrounding the three domestic automobile manufacturers  all of which worsened between our third and fourth quarter impairment assessments 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in our income approach  we increased our wacc from the one utilized in our impairment assessment during the third quarter of and historical levels 
in addition  because of the negative selling trends experienced in the fourth quarter of  we revised our industry sales outlook  or seasonally adjusted annual rate or saar  from the forecast used in our third quarter assessment 
further  with regards to the assumptions within our market approach  we utilized historical market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue and pretax net income 
these multiples and the resulting fair value estimates were adversely impacted by the declines in stock values during much of  including the fourth quarter 
as a result  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  predominantly related to franchises in our western region 
gain on debt redemption in  we redeemed million in aggregate par value of our notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain 
in addition  we redeemed million in aggregate par value of our notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain and a proportionate reduction in deferred tax assets relative to unamortized costs of the purchased options acquired in conjunction with the initial issuance 
the cost of the options was deductible for tax purposes as an original issue discount 
no value was attributed to the equity component of the notes at the time of the redemption and  therefore  no adjustment to additional paid in capital was recognized 
lease terminations our results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a million pretax charge  related to the termination of a dealership facility lease 
the lease was terminated in conjunction with the relocation of several of our dealership franchises from one to multiple facilities 
discontinued operations during the year ended december  we disposed of certain operations that qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment 
the necessary reclassifications have been made to our consolidated statement of operations for year ended december   as well as our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   to reflect these operations as discontinued 
in addition  we have made reclassifications to the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which was derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  form k  to properly reflect the discontinued operations 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt by asc year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with six of our dealerships to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of further  in conjunction with the sale of real estate associated with one of our dealerships  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge 
in addition  
table of contents we recognized a total of million in additional pretax impairment charges related to the impairment of fixed assets  primarily associated with sold dealerships and terminated franchises 
lease terminations during the first half of  our results were negatively impacted by million of pretax charges as we terminated real estate leases associated with the sale or termination of two of our domestic brand franchises 
in addition  we successfully completed the conversion of all of our stores to operate on the adp platform for dealership management services 
as a result  we recognized million in lease termination costs related to these conversions 
loss on bond redemption during the third quarter  we recognized a million pretax charge on the redemption of million of our notes 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt by asc these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion 
key performance indicators the following table highlights certain of the key performance indicators we use to manage our business consolidated statistical data for the year ended december  unit sales retail sales new vehicle used vehicle total retail sales wholesale sales total vehicle sales gross margin new vehicle retail sales total used vehicle sales parts and service sales total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin pretax margin finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following discussion briefly highlights certain of the results and trends occurring within our business 
throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances  which are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
declining consumer confidence  increasing unemployment  reduced credit availability and weakening economic conditions negatively impacted our operating results in the weakening economic conditions started in late and resulted in excessive new vehicle inventory across much of the industry as we entered during the first months of  the industry sold out of the excessive inventory levels resulting in depressed new vehicle gross margin levels 
the cars program significantly stimulated new vehicle sales and gross margins in the third quarter of and depleted new vehicle inventory levels 
while the margin impact of the cars program was positive  it did not fully offset the lower levels in the first six months of we believe that our performance was generally consistent with national retail results of the major brands we represent and the overall blend of markets in which we operate 
our used vehicle results are directly affected by economic conditions  the level of manufacturer 
table of contents incentives on new vehicles and new vehicle financing  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
the slowing new vehicle business sharply affected the number of quality used vehicle trade ins coming into our dealerships in and made the sourcing of used vehicles more challenging 
we were forced to source a larger percentage of our used vehicle inventory from auctions  which has put pressure on our used retail margins 
the tighter supply and increased demand for used vehicles increased prices at the auctions for most of and resulted in improved profitability in the wholesale segment of our business 
and  as the differential between new and used vehicle sales prices shrank towards the end of  used vehicle demand weakened and margins were further constricted 
the used vehicle gross margin in was negatively impacted by the shift in consumer preference between cars and trucks due to the gasoline price spike in the second quarter of our consolidated finance and insurance income per retail unit also felt the negative impact of the declining economic conditions 
however  our total gross margin improved as a result of the increased margin in our used vehicle business and the shift in business mix from our lower margin vehicle business to our higher margin parts and service business 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased in absolute dollars as a result of the cost reductions we put in place starting in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of gross profit  sg a expense declined from  despite a decline in gross profit 
included in our sg a expense decline for was million of personnel related cost savings and million of advertising and other variable expense cuts 
the combination of these factors  coupled with a million impairment charge recognized in related to our intangible franchise rights and certain of our real estate holdings  contributed to a basis point increase in our operating margin 
we recorded a million impairment charge in  primarily related to real estate holdings 
our floorplan interest expense decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in our weighted average borrowings 
other interest expense decreased in  primarily attributable to the redemption of a portion of our notes in the fourth quarter of and the first nine months of as a result  and including the reduced level of gains on the repurchase of those notes in compared to  our pretax margin increased basis points in we further address these items  and other variances between the periods presented in the results of operations section below 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to the recent accounting pronouncements section within note  summary of significant accounting polices and estimates  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of those most recent pronouncements that impact us 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates and policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies and estimates 
discontinued operations 
on june   we sold certain operations constituting our entire dealership holdings in one particular market that qualified for discontinued operations accounting and reporting treatment 
in 
table of contents order to reflect these operations as discontinued  the necessary reclassifications have been made to our consolidated statements of operations  as well as our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and inventories 
we carry new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for parts and accessories or market in the consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus the cost of reconditioning  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of the automobile manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our consolidated balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operations as the vehicles are sold 
at december  and  inventory cost had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for interest assistance received from manufacturers 
new vehicle cost of sales was reduced by million  million and million for interest assistance received related to vehicles sold for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the assistance ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
as the market value of inventory typically declines over time  we establish new and used vehicle reserves based on our historical loss experience and considerations of current market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform the annual impairment assessment of goodwill by reporting unit at the end of each calendar year using a fair value based  two step test 
an impairment analysis is done more frequently if certain events or circumstances arise that would indicate a change in the fair value of the non financial asset has occurred ie  an impairment indicator 
as of december   we defined our reporting units as each of our three regions in the us and the us we use a combination of the discounted cash flow  or income  approach and the market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future sg a expenses and an estimated weighted average cost of capital or wacc 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in our income approach as of december   we based our analysis on a slow recovery back to normalized levels of a seasonally adjusted annual rate or saar of million units by for the market approach  we utilize recent market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue and pretax net income 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of the industry  recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
we have concluded that these valuation inputs qualify goodwill to be categorized within level of our asc topic no 
 fair value of measurements and disclosures asc hierarchy framework see note  fair value measurements 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in the estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting unit s 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to its respective fair value 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets  we are then required to proceed to step two of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price of the business combination 
this allocation could result in assigning value to intangible assets not previously recorded separately from goodwill prior to the adoption of guidance primarily codified within the asc topic no 
 business combinations asc  which could result in less implied residual value assigned to goodwill see discussion regarding franchise rights 
table of contents acquired prior to july   in intangible franchise rights below 
we then compare the value of the implied goodwill resulting from this second step to the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
at december   and  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of its net assets ie  step one of the impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test 
see note  intangible franchise rights and goodwill  for additional details regarding our goodwill 
intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers  which are recorded at an individual dealership level 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue for an indefinite period and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period and  therefore  the carrying amount of franchise rights are not amortized 
franchise rights acquired in business acquisitions prior to july   were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain as part of goodwill at december  and in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
since july   intangible franchise rights acquired in business combinations have been recorded as distinctly separate intangible assets and  in accordance with guidance primarily codified within asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate these franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment has occurred 
to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future sg a expenses 
using an estimated wacc  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
accordingly  we have concluded that these valuation inputs qualify intangible franchise rights to be categorized within level of the asc hierarchy framework see note  fair value measurements 
if any one of the above assumptions change or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in the intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in an additional impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
see note  asset impairments  and note  intangible franchise rights and goodwill  for additional details regarding our intangible franchise rights 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
revenues from vehicle sales  parts sales and vehicle service are recognized upon completion of the sale and delivery to the customer 
conditions to completing a sale include having an agreement with the customer  including pricing  and the sales price must be reasonably expected to be collected 
we record the profit we receive for arranging vehicle fleet transactions net in other finance and insurance revenues  net 
since all sales of new vehicles must occur through franchised new vehicle dealerships  the dealerships effectively act as agents for the automobile manufacturers in completing sales of vehicles to fleet customers 
as these customers typically order the vehicles  we have no significant general inventory risk 
additionally  fleet customers generally receive special purchase incentives from the automobile manufacturers and we receive only a nominal fee for facilitating the transactions 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental agencies are not included in total revenues 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 

table of contents we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed the reserve at december   by million 
we consolidate the operations of our reinsurance companies 
we reinsure the credit life and accident and health insurance policies sold by our dealerships 
all of the revenues and related direct costs from the sales of these policies are deferred and recognized over the life of the policies 
during  we terminated our offerings of credit life and accident and health insurance policies 
investment of the net assets of these companies are regulated by state insurance commissions and consist of permitted investments  in general  government backed securities and obligations of government agencies 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
these investments  along with restricted cash that is not invested  are classified as other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we purchase insurance policies for worker s compensation  liability  auto physical damage  property  pollution  employee medical benefits and other risks consisting of large deductibles and or self insured retentions 
we engage a third party actuary to conduct a study of the exposures under the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs for all open policy years 
this actuarial study is updated on an annual basis  and the appropriate adjustments are made to the accrual 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the actuarially determined loss rate per employee used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed the reserve for these losses at december   by million 
for workers compensation and general liability insurance policy years ended prior to october   this component of our insurance program included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit the stop loss plans 
due to historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy year beginning november  and for each subsequent year the no stop loss plans 
our exposure per claim under the no stop loss plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of the stop loss plans originally totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of the amounts paid or accrued  the remaining potential loss exposure under the stop loss plans totals million at december  fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  contracts in transit and vehicle receivables  accounts and notes receivable  investments in debt and equity securities  accounts payable  credit facilities  long term debt and interest rate swaps 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  contracts in transit and vehicle receivables  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  and credit facilities approximate their carrying values due to the short term nature of these instruments or the existence of variable interest rates 
our investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and thus are carried at fair market value 
as of december  and  the face value of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due notes was million 
the notes had a carrying value  net of applicable discount  of million and million as of december  and  respectively  and a fair value  based on quoted market prices  of million and million  respectively 
also  as of december  and  the face value of our outstanding notes was million and million  respectively 
the notes had a carrying value  net of applicable discount  of million and million  respectively  and a fair value  based on quoted market prices  of million and 
table of contents million as of december  and  respectively 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair market value 
see notes and for further details regarding our derivative financial instruments and fair value measurements 
we maintain multiple trust accounts comprised of money market funds with short term investments in marketable securities  such as us government securities  commercial paper and bankers acceptances  that have maturities of less than three months 
also within the trust accounts  we hold investments in debt instruments  such as government obligations and other fixed income securities 
we account for investments in marketable securities and debt instruments under guidance primarily codified within asc topic no 
 investments debt and equity securities asc  which establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in equity instruments that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities 
these investments are designated as available for sale  measured at fair value and classified as either cash and cash equivalents or other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon maturity terms and certain contractual restrictions 
as these investments are fairly liquid  we believe our fair value techniques accurately reflect their market values and are subject to changes that are market driven and subject to demand and supply of the financial instrument markets 
the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and  accordingly  has classified such investments within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note the debt securities are measured based upon quoted market prices utilizing public information  independent external valuations from pricing services or third party advisors 
accordingly  we have concluded the valuation measurement inputs of these debt securities to represent  at their lowest level  quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets where there are few transactions for the assets and have categorized such investments within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note the cost basis of the debt securities as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are estimated using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
we utilize third party experts to determine the fair values of property and equipment purchased 
income taxes 
currently  we operate in different states in the us and in the us  each of which has unique tax rates and payment calculations 
as the amount of income generated in each jurisdiction varies from period to period  our estimated effective tax rate can vary based on the proportion of taxable income generated in each jurisdiction 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
 income taxes asc 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the underlying assets are realized or liabilities are settled 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective january   the fasb clarified the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order to be recognized in the financial statements see note for additional information 
no cumulative adjustment was required to effect the adoption of this pronouncement 
we have recognized deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  that we believe will be realized  based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
as it relates to net operating losses  a corresponding valuation allowance has been established to the extent that we have determined that net income attributable to certain states jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize the benefit

the combination of slowing economic conditions  declining consumer confidence  higher jobless rates  tightened credit standards and industry wide pressure to lower vehicle inventory levels led to lower sales and extremely competitive pricing 
partially offsetting these negative economic conditions throughout was the impact of the cars program  which had a positive effect on our third quarter results 
we sold  qualifying new vehicle units under the cars program 
we experienced unit sales decreases in each of the major brands that we represent 
our retail car unit sales declined by in  while our retail truck unit sales declined by  as compared with the same period in we believe that our performance is generally consistent with national retail results of the brands we represent and the overall markets in which we operate 
the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share during future periods  is difficult to predict 
our same store new vehicle revenues declined from to  on a similar percentage decrease in same store retail unit sales 
slowing economic conditions and declining consumer confidence impacted overall new vehicle demand in the us and  on a regional basis  we experienced weakness particularly in the california and florida markets 
our predominantly car franchises were negatively impacted by the slowing economy in resulting in an aggregate decrease in unit sales of cars by from levels 
same store revenues from our import and luxury brands fell and from to  on and less retail units  respectively

our same store unit sales in our truck lines decreased from to same store revenues from our truck heavy domestic franchises were down from to our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points from to the rapid fall off in demand across the nation led to significant build ups of new vehicle inventories across all brands  putting significant pressure on margins in the first half of in addition the bankruptcies of chrysler and general motors further pressured margins as dealers moved aggressively to reduce their inventories of these brands

our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points from to depressed economic conditions in many of the markets in which we operate were exacerbated by the financial crises of september and following 
as a result  we experienced a decline in new vehicle sales that pressured our margins 
we experienced a decrease in same store new vehicle gross margin in most of our major brands 
further depressing new vehicle margins in was the shift in customer preference towards more fuel efficient vehicles during most of the year  which largely affected our truck dependent domestic brands  as well as the truck lines of our import brands 
for the year ended december  compared to  our same store gross profit per retail unit pru declined to  representing a decline in pru for our domestic nameplates  a decrease in pru for our luxury brands and a decline in pru from our import nameplates 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the mix of units being sold  as domestic brands tend to provide more assistance  the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and market interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
to further mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million as of december   at a weighted average libor interest rate of 
we record the majority of the impact of the periodic settlements of these swaps as a component of floorplan interest expense  effectively hedging a substantial portion of our total floorplan interest expense and mitigating the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  in this declining interest rate environment  our interest assistance recognized as a percent of total floorplan interest expense has declined 
over the past three years  this assistance as a percentage of our total consolidated floorplan interest expense has ranged from in the third quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
we continue to aggressively manage our new vehicle inventory in response to the rapidly changing market conditions 
as a result  and coupled with the success of the cars program in the third quarter of  we reduced our new vehicle inventory levels by million  or  from million as of december  to million as of december  further  we made significant progress in aligning our inventory mix with demand  as the new truck percentage of inventory declined from as of december  to as of december  finally  our consolidated days supply of new vehicle inventory decreased to days at december  from days at december

the same economic and consumer confidence issues that have slowed our new vehicle business have also negatively impacted used vehicle sales  and as a result our same store used retail unit sales and revenues declined and  respectively  in as compared to further  since the new vehicle business is our best source of used vehicle inventory and that business has suffered a sustained slowdown  we are more challenged to source used vehicles profitably for our customers 
and  even though the cars program resulted in an influx of new vehicle customers during the third quarter of  sourcing of used retail inventory was not improved due to the nature of the cars program  which required all trade ins to be destroyed 
despite the challenging economic times  we continue to improve our certified pre owned cpo volume as a percentage of total retail sales 
cpo units represented of total same store used retail units for as compared to in as a result  our same store retail used vehicle gross profit pru decreased from  in to  in  while our same store gross margin decreased basis points over the same period 
our same store retail unit sales decreased from to  to  units and same store retail revenues fell 
pressure on new vehicle margins translated into pressure on used vehicle margins  as well 
in addition  the shift in customer preferences away from trucks in placed added pressure on our retail used vehicle profits 
as a result  our same store retail used vehicle pru declined from  in to  in  while our same store gross margin shrank basis points over the same period 
our continued focus on used vehicle sales and inventory management processes coupled with the lack of availability of used vehicles industry wide has shifted more of our used vehicle sales mix from the wholesale business to the traditionally more profitable retail sales 
in addition  the qualified trade ins under the cars 
table of contents program were required to be destroyed  further depressing our used wholesale business 
correspondingly  our same store wholesale unit sales decreased from to to  units  while same store wholesale revenues decreased to million for the same period 
for the year ended december   compared to  same store wholesale unit sales decreased to  units and same store wholesale revenues fell to million  primarily due to our inventory management processes 
the overall increase in used vehicle profits for was reflective of an improvement in used vehicle wholesale values  resulting from a general supply shortage and increased dealer demand  partially offset by lower retail results 
because of the limited availability of quality used vehicles  the price of vehicles sold at auction increased  leading to higher profits and margins in our wholesale vehicles 
assuming that the stabilization of used vehicle values continues and used vehicle supply catches up with demand  we would expect the wholesale gross profit per unit to return to more normal levels  closer to break even 
we continuously work to optimize our used vehicle inventory levels to provide adequate supply and selection

the decline in our same store warranty parts and service revenues was primarily the result of certain manufacturer quality issues in that were rectified in our same store wholesale parts business declined in primarily due to the negative impact of the economy on many of the second tier collision centers and mechanical repair shops with which we do business and our decision to tighten our credit standards in this area

impairment of assets we did not identify an impairment of our recorded intangible franchise rights in  nor our recorded goodwill in  or we perform an annual review of the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we also perform interim reviews for impairment when evidence exists that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  certain triggering events such as the recent economic conditions and the resulting impact on the automotive industry were identified 
accordingly  we performed an interim impairments assessment of the recorded indefinite lived intangible asset values 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that the fair values of certain of our indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to seventeen dealerships  primarily domestic franchises  were less than their respective carrying values and recorded an impairment charge of million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that the fair values of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to seven of our dealerships did not exceed their carrying values and that impairment charges were required

table of contents our floorplan interest expense fluctuates with changes in borrowings outstanding and interest rates  which are based on month libor or prime in some cases plus a spread 
we typically utilize excess cash on hand to pay down our floorplan borrowings  and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross floorplan interest expense 
mitigating the impact of interest rate fluctuations  we employ an interest rate hedging strategy  whereby we swap variable interest rate exposure for a fixed interest rate over the term of the variable interest rate debt

historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of 
table of contents new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  dealership acquisition activity  or manufacturer imaging programs 
due to the current and near term projected economical conditions  we continue to critically evaluate all capital expenditures for an acceptable return on investment and to work with our manufacturer partners in this area

cash needed to complete our acquisitions came from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our floorplan facilities and our acquisition line 
purchase of convertible note hedge 
in connection with the issuance of the notes in  we purchased ten year call options on our common stock the purchased options 
under the terms of the purchased options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  we have the right to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the total cost of the purchased options was million 
the cost of the purchased options results in future income tax deductions that we expect will total approximately million 
in addition to the purchase of the purchased options  we sold warrants in separate transactions the warrants

the warrants are exercisable for a maximum of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment for quarterly dividends in excess of per quarter  liquidation  bankruptcy  or a change in control of our company and other conditions 
subject to these adjustments  the maximum amount of shares of our common stock that could be required to be issued under the warrants is million shares 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million 
the purchased option and warrant transactions were designed to increase the conversion price per share of our common stock from to a premium to the closing price of our common stock on the date that the notes were priced to investors and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the notes  if any 
no shares of our common stock have been issued or received under the purchased options or the warrants

although the purchased options have the economic benefit of decreasing the dilutive effect of the notes  for earnings per share purposes we cannot factor this benefit into our dilutive shares outstanding as their impact would be anti dilutive 
stock repurchases 
we generally fund our stock repurchases from excess cash 
in august  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase a number of shares equivalent to the shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan on a quarterly basis

dividends 
the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering the results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
provisions of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of disbursements we may make outside the ordinary course of business 
these include limitations on the payment of cash dividends and on stock repurchases  which are limited to a percentage of cumulative net income 
as of december   our notes were the most restrictive agreement with respect to such limits 
this amount will increase or decrease in future periods by adding to the current limitation the sum of of our consolidated net income  if positive  and of equity issuances  less actual dividends or stock repurchases completed in each quarterly period

we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial 
table of contents terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  the company s subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries interests in any real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  the company s subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  the company and its subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by the company and its subsidiaries in connection with such leases 
although the company generally has indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and the company presently has no reason to believe that it or its subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  the company estimates that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  of the total obligation  million of the remaining rental payment obligations are associated with facilities operated as a chrysler or general motor brand dealership 
the company s exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance of the company or its subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and cash flows 
the company and its subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease 
however  the company presently has no reason to believe that it or its subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
registration statement 
we have a well known seasoned issuer universal shelf registration statement  effective august   to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales 
the company intends to use the proceeds from any future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes  which may include repayment of debt  the financing of capital expenditures  future acquisitions and additions to our working capital 
the company has not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
interest rates 
we have interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
our policy is to manage our interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of our notes and notes  which is primarily all of our fixed rate debt  totaled million and million  respectively  and had a fair value of million and million respectively 
the carrying amount of our notes and notes was million and million  respectively  at december  at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding and million of variable rate mortgage facility borrowings outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount outstanding and before the impact of our interest rate swaps described below  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point increase would yield a net increase of million 
we reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated unit is sold 
during the years ended december  and december   we recognized million and million of interest 
table of contents assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility and variable rate mortgage facility borrowings to fixed rate debt 
as of december   we held interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of million that fixed our underlying libor rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
three of the hedge instruments expire december  at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
the decrease in net unrealized losses from to was primarily a result of the maturing of the hedge instruments 
at december   and  all of our derivative contracts were determined to be effective  and no material ineffective portion was recognized in income during the years then ended 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk the functional currency of our uk subsidiaries is the pound sterling 
we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations and  as such  do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
if we change our intent with respect to such international investment  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an million change to our revenues for the year ended december  however  we do utilize foreign currency translation hedge contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans between our uk and uk affiliates 
the hedge contracts are executed with substantially identical terms and notional amounts to the underlying transactions 
a change in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a million change in fair value of our foreign currency exchange derivative instrument as of december
