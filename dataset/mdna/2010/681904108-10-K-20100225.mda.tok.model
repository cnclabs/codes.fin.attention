however  ebitda does not represent net cash flows from operating activities  as defined by us gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ebitda may differ from the calculation of ebitda by others 
see five year summary of selected financial data for a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash flows from operating activities  at part ii  item of this filing

net sales for the year were favorably impacted by drug price inflation  the increased use of certain higher acuity drugs  biologic agents and existing drugs with new therapeutic indications  and acquisitions  as well as growth in specialty pharmacy services 
more than offsetting these factors were the unfavorable sales impact of the increased availability and utilization of generic drugs  reductions in reimbursement and or utilization for certain drugs as well as competitive pricing issues  a lower average number of beds served year over year  a shift in mix towards assisted living and lower revenues in the company s clinical research organization cro business

more than offsetting these factors were certain of the aforementioned items that reduced net sales  primarily the reductions in reimbursement and or utilization for certain drugs  competitive pricing issues and the lower average number of beds served year over year 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts  rebates and other price concessions from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs

during the company paid down million on the term loans 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings on the million revolving credit facility  and million in borrowings were outstanding on the term loans 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share for an indicated annual rate of cents per common share for  which is consistent with annual dividends paid per common share for the  and years 
aggregate dividends of million paid during were relatively consistent with the million paid in and the million paid in during the second quarter of  the company repurchased approximately million shares of omnicare s common stock at a cost of approximately million under a stock buyback program authorized by its board of directors 
there were no known material commitments and contingencies outstanding at december   other than the contractual obligations summarized in the disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements caption below  certain acquisition related payments potentially due in the future  including deferred payments  indemnification payments and payments originating from earnout and other provisions that may become payable  as well as the matters discussed in the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the legal proceedings section at part i  item of this filing 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the company believes that external sources of financing  including short and long term debt financings  are available 
due to recent conditions in the credit markets  omnicare may not be able to refinance maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which the company previously benefited or at terms that are acceptable to omnicare 
in addition  no assurances can be given regarding the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s aggregate contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years after years debt obligations a capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other current obligations c other long term obligations d subtotal future interest relating to debt and capital lease obligations e total contractual cash obligations a the noted obligation amounts represent the principal portion of the associated debt obligations 
details of the company s outstanding debt instruments can be found in the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

e represents estimated future pretax interest costs based on the stated fixed interest rate of the debt  or the variable interest rate in effect at period end for variable interest rate debt 
the estimated future interest costs presented in this table do not include any amounts potentially payable associated with the contingent interest and interest reset provisions of the company s convertible debentures 
to the extent that any debt would be paid off by omnicare prior to the stated due date or refinanced  the estimated future interest costs would change accordingly 
further  these analyses do not consider the effects of potential changes in the company s credit rating on future interest costs  as well as any tax effects associated with the company s interest costs 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had two unconsolidated entities  omnicare capital trust i  a statutory trust formed by the company the old trust and omnicare capital trust ii the new trust  which were established for the purpose of facilitating the offerings of the trust preferred income equity redeemable securities due the old trust piers and the series b trust preferred income equity redeemable securities the new trust piers  respectively 
for financial reporting purposes  the old trust and new trust are treated as equity method investments of the company 
the old trust and new trust are owned finance subsidiaries of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust and new trust 
the old debentures issued by the company to the old trust and the new debentures issued by the company to the new trust in connection with the issuance of the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively  are presented as a single line item in omnicare s consolidated balance sheets and debt footnote disclosures 
additionally  the related disclosures concerning the old trust piers and the new trust piers  the guarantees  and the old debentures and new debentures are included in the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
omnicare records interest payable to the old trust and new trust as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the company had no other unconsolidated entities  or any financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates on variable rate debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis points 
the company s debt obligations at december  include million outstanding under the variable rate senior term a loan  due july   at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due  and million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due with an optional repurchase right of holders on december  
in connection with its offering of million of senior notes  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months  plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with the authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging  so changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement is recorded as a noncurrent asset or liability  with an offsetting increase or decrease  respectively  to the book carrying value of the related senior notes  and amounted to approximately million at the end of additionally  at december   the fair value of omnicare s variable rate debt facilities approximated the carrying value  as the effective interest rates fluctuate with changes in market rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt facilities is based on quoted market prices and is summarized as follows in thousands fair value of financial instruments december  december  financial instrument book value market value book value market value senior subordinated notes  due  gross senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due junior subordinated convertible debentures  due carrying value unamortized debt discount principal amount convertible senior debentures  due carrying value unamortized debt discount principal amount embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
in addition  the convertible debentures include an interest reset provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued  and at period end  the values of the derivatives embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to its provision for doubtful accounts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  legal and regulatory contingencies  fair value determinations  and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
omnicare s critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently and highly uncertain  including those matters further discussed below 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
omnicare management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition omnicare recognizes revenue when products are delivered or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy services segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products have been reimbursed by the federal medicare part d plan and  to a lesser extent  state medicaid programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a portion of the company s revenue systems  are largely computerized enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of the company s revenue systems  the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed  unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for billed  unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicare  medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
patient co payments are associated with medicare part d see further discussion below  certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
a patient may be dispensed prescribed medications typically no more than a day supply prior to insurance being verified in emergency situations  or for new facility admissions after hours or on weekends 
as soon as practicable typically the following business day  specific payor information is obtained so that the proper payor can be billed for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
contract research services segment a portion of the company s overall revenues relates to the contract research services cro segment  and is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  nutraceutical  medical devices and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue  on the respective lines of the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance  cash flows and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility  private pay and part d customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the company computes and monitors its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  a non gaap measure  in order to evaluate the liquidity and collection patterns of its accounts receivable 
dso is calculated by averaging the beginning and end of quarter accounts receivable  less contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to derive average accounts receivable and dividing average accounts receivable by the sales amount excluding reimbursable out of pockets for the related quarter 
the resultant percentage is multiplied by days to derive the dso amount 
omnicare s dso approximated days at december   which was lower than the december  dso amount of days by approximately days 
on july   the company commenced legal action against a group of its customers for  among other things  the collection of past due receivables that are owed to the company 
specifically  approximately million excluding interest and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts is owed to the company by this group of customers as of december   of which approximately million is past due based on applicable payment terms a significant portion of which is not reserved based on the relevant facts and circumstances 
the million represents approximately days of the overall dso at december  as previously disclosed  the company has experienced on going administrative and payment issues associated with the medicare part d implementation  resulting in outstanding gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts  particularly for copays 
as of december   copays outstanding from part d plans were approximately million relating to and the company is pursuing solutions  including legal actions against certain part d payors  to collect outstanding copays  as well as certain rejected claims 
until all administrative and payment issues relating to the part d drug benefit as well as the aforementioned legal action against a group of omnicare s customers are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that the impact of these matters on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows will not change based on the outcome of any unforeseen future developments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts represented and of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december  and  respectively 
unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in the company s provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages  which could materially impact the overall financial results  financial position or cash flows of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts as of december  would result in an increase to the provision for doubtful accounts and related allowance for doubtful accounts on the balance sheet of approximately million pretax 
the following table is an aging of the company s december   september  and december  gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts  aged based on payment terms and categorized based on the four primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments september  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments patient charges pending approval from medicare  medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicare  medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicare  medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers  as well as efforts to collect rework medicare part d copays and rejected claims 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible by omnicare management including the national credit and collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   except for the accounts receivable matters separately disclosed in this filing  the company does not have a significant portion of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly  additional part d payment issues arise  or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would then be  potentially  adversely affected 
fair value on january   the company adopted the provisions of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements  which defines a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs in fair value measurements 
level measurements are measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level measurements use significant other observable inputs 
level measurements are measurements using significant unobservable inputs which require a company to develop its own assumptions 
in recording the fair value of assets and liabilities  companies must use the most reliable measurement available 
the impact to the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows upon adoption of this guidance was not material 
see further discussion at the fair value note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are not any significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory obsolescence write offs 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases the company s policy is to perform them at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
goodwill the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
this guidance requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment is largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the book carrying value of the assets would exceed their fair value  an impairment loss may be necessary 
changes in the estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
insurance accruals omnicare is self insured for certain employee health insurance claims 
the company manages its health insurance risk by obtaining individual and aggregate stop loss coverage in the amount of  per claim and of expected aggregate claims 
additionally  omnicare insures all of its property and casualty programs including worker s compensation and professional liability in excess of self insured retentions  or deductibles  on the various policies of insurance which range from between  and  per claim  depending on the type of coverage 
omnicare closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience  and obtains input from third party insurance and valuation professionals  to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for its self insured programs  including the aforementioned deductibles 
these accruals include provision for incurred  as well as incurred but not yet reported  claims 
in developing its self insurance accrual estimates  the company s liability calculation also considers the historical claim lag periods and current payment trends of insurance claims generally approximately months for health  and months for all other coverages 
a change in the historical claim lag period assumption by one month for health insurance claims would affect health insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
a change in the historical claim lag period by one month for property and casualty insurance claims would affect property and casualty insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events potentially resulting in atypical claims experience  the company s historical claims experience  coupled with its stop loss coverages  has consistently supported management s assumption that this methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates and accruals over a long term period 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  mortality rates  and the assumed rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
while it is required that the actuarial assumptions be reviewed each year as of the measurement date of december  the actuarial assumptions generally do not change between measurement dates 
during omnicare s annual review  generally near the beginning of the fiscal year  the company reviews and updates these assumptions  and considers historical experience  current market conditions and input from its third party advisors  including any changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates attempt to anticipate future events  and if assessed differently  or if they materially vary from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions used to calculate the company s pension obligation  holding all other assumptions constant  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated operating results 
taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for income taxes  the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under this authoritative guidance  recognition and measurement are considered discrete events 
the recognition threshold is met when it is determined a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation as further described in the stock based compensation  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  this authoritative guidance requires the company to record compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in its financial statements under a fair value recognition model 
under the provisions of this authoritative guidance  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award usually the vesting period 
the company uses the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date  which is affected by omnicare s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  as further discussed below 
these variables include omnicare s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and the stock s dividend yield 
the expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is estimated giving consideration primarily to historical stock option exercise experience 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a period generally commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the risk free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on united states treasury strip stripped coupon interest issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on the current omnicare stock yield 
the company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods as necessary to reflect any changes in actual forfeiture experience 
omnicare uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock option awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting period 
considering the importance of each of the above assumptions in the calculation of fair value  the company re evaluates the estimate of these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while the company believes its stock option fair value calculations are materially accurate  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  is not expected to have a material impact on the fair value calculated by the company 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of inspections  audits  inquiries  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for contingencies 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued  as required by gaap 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
information pertaining to legal proceedings is further discussed at the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards information pertaining to recently issued accounting standards is further discussed at the recently issued accounting standards section of the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook historically  the company has derived approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers  long term care and other institutional health care facilities and its contract research organization business 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system and payments to certain providers 
in congress mandated a prospective payment system pps for reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities snfs for their medicare eligible residents during a medicare part a covered stay 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services  including pharmacy services 
pps initially resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
although some of the reductions were subsequently mitigated  the pps fundamentally changed the payment for medicare snf services 
in recent years  snfs have received the full market basket inflation increase to annual rates 
for fiscal year  beginning october   snfs received a percent inflation update that increased overall payments to snfs by million 
however  for fiscal year  beginning on october   payments to snfs were reduced by percent  or by million to snfs overall  compared to fiscal year levels 
while the payment levels reflect a percent market basket inflation update  that amount was more than offset by a percent billion adjustment intended to recalibrate case mix weights to compensate for increased expenditures resulting from refinements made in january these or other reimbursement changes could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients  which  in turn  could adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
in december  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma  which included a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d 
the part d drug benefit permits medicare beneficiaries to enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs collectively  part d plans 
part d plans include plans providing the drug benefit on a stand alone basis known as prescription drug plans  or pdps and medicare advantage plans providing drug coverage as a supplement to an existing medical benefit under that medicare advantage plan known as ma pds 
medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from plan to plan  although the centers for medicare medicaid services cms provides various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles have their prescription drug costs covered by the medicare drug benefit  unless they elect to opt out of part d coverage 
many nursing home residents omnicare serves are dual eligibles 
in  approximately of omnicare s revenue was derived from beneficiaries covered under the federal medicare part d program 
cms provides premium and cost sharing subsidies to part d plans for dual eligible residents of nursing homes 
such dual eligibles are not required to pay a premium for enrollment in a part d plan  so long as the premium for the part d plan in which they are enrolled does not exceed the premium subsidy  nor are they required to meet deductibles or pay copayment amounts 
further  all dual eligibles who do not affirmatively enroll in a part d plan are automatically enrolled into a pdp by cms on a random basis from among those pdps meeting cms criteria for low income premiums in the pdp region  unless they elect to opt out of part d coverage 
such dual eligible beneficiaries may select a different part d plan at any time through the part d enrollment process 
also  dual eligibles who are qualifying covered retirees under an employer or union sponsored qualified retiree prescription drug plan plans which offer an alternative to part d coverage supported by federal subsidies to the plan sponsor will be determined to have elected not to enroll in a part d plan  unless they affirmatively enroll in a part d plan or contact cms to indicate they wish to be auto enrolled 
in sum  dual eligible residents of nursing homes are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary  or an exception to the plan s formulary is granted  subject to prior authorization or similar utilization management requirements for certain drugs 
cms requires the formularies of part d plans to include the types of drugs most commonly needed by medicare beneficiaries and to offer an exceptions process to provide coverage for medically necessary drugs 
the company obtains reimbursement for drugs it provides to enrollees of a given part d plan pursuant to the agreement it negotiates with that part d plan 
the company has entered into such agreements with nearly all part d plan sponsors under which it will provide drugs and associated services to their enrollees 
the company continues to have ongoing discussions with part d plans and renegotiates these agreements in the ordinary course 
further  the proportion of the company s part d business serviced under specific agreements may change over time based upon beneficiary choice  reassignment of dual eligibles to different part d plans  part d plan consolidation and other factors 
as such  reimbursement under these agreements is subject to change 
moreover  as expected in the transition to a new program of this magnitude  certain administrative and payment issues have arisen  resulting in higher operating expenses  as well as outstanding gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts  particularly for copays owed by part d plans for dual eligibles and other low income subsidy eligible beneficiaries 
as of december   copays outstanding from part d plans were approximately million  relating to and the company is pursuing solutions  including legal actions against certain part d payors  to collect outstanding copays  as well as certain rejected claims 
participants in the long term care pharmacy industry continue to address these issues with cms and the part d plans and attempt to develop solutions 
among other things  on january   cms finalized a change in its regulations requiring part d plan sponsors to accept and act upon certain types of documentation  referred to as best available evidence  to correct copays 
similarly  on october   cms published proposed rules that would make numerous changes to the regulations governing part d  including certain part d plan payment rules and processes 
language in the preamble to the proposed rule suggests that part d plans would be required to correct and pay copay amounts within days of receiving complete information for the copay reconciliation 
however  until a final rule is issued and all administrative and payment issues are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that implementation issues associated with the part d drug benefit will not adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
for medicare beneficiaries covered under a medicare part a stay  the company receives reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the snfs  in accordance with the terms of the agreements it has negotiated with each snf 
the company also receives reimbursement from the state medicaid programs  for those medicaid beneficiaries not eligible for the part d program  including those under age who are not disabled  and for certain drugs specifically excluded from medicare part d 
cms has issued subregulatory guidance on many aspects of the part d program  including the provision of pharmaceutical services to long term care residents 
cms has also expressed some concerns about pharmacies receipt of discounts  rebates and other price concessions from drug manufacturers 
for and  cms instructed part d plan sponsors to require pharmacies to disclose to the part d plan sponsor any discounts  rebates and other direct or indirect remuneration designed to directly or indirectly influence or impact utilization of part d drugs 
the company reported information specified by cms with respect to rebates received by the company for and the first quarter of to those part d plans which agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 
on november  cms suspended collection of the long term care pharmacy rebate data from part d plan sponsors for calendar years and instead  cms developed its plan to collect different non rebate information to focus plan attention on network pharmacy compliance and appropriate drug utilization management 
the final part d reporting requirements for calendar year include instructions for plans to report to cms the number and cost of formulary versus non formulary prescription drugs dispensed in the aggregate by each long term care pharmacy and by all retail pharmacies as a group in the part d plan s service area 
cms also issued a memo on november  reminding part d plan sponsors of the requirement to provide convenient access to network long term care pharmacies to all of their enrollees residing in long term care facilities  and exclude payment for drugs that are covered under a medicare part a stay that would otherwise satisfy the definition of a part d drug 
the company will continue to work with part d plan sponsors to ensure compliance with cms s evolving policies related to long term care pharmacy services 
on july   congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa 
this law includes further reforms to the part d program 
among other things  as of january   the law requires that long term care pharmacies have between and days to submit claims to a part d plan 
as of january   part d plan sponsors must update the prescription drug pricing data they use to pay pharmacies at least every seven days 
the law also expands the number of medicare beneficiaries who are entitled to premium and cost sharing subsidies by modifying previous income and asset requirements  eliminates late enrollment penalties for beneficiaries entitled to these subsidies  and limits the sales and marketing activities in which part d plan sponsors may engage 
on september   cms published final regulations implementing many of the mippa part d provisions  and the agency published another interim final rule with comment period on january  implementing additional mippa provisions related to drug formularies and protected classes of drugs 
additional legislative proposals are pending before congress that could further modify the part d benefit  including proposals that could impact the payment available or pricing for drugs under part d plans 
the company cannot predict at this time whether such legislation will be enacted or the form any such legislation would take 
the company can make no assurances that future part d legislation would not impact its business 
moreover  cms continues to issue guidance on and make other revisions to the part d program 
the company is continuing to monitor issues relating to implementation of the part d benefit  and until further agency guidance is known and until all administrative and payment issues associated with this massive program are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that the impact of the part d rules  future legislative changes  or the outcome of other potential developments relating to its implementation on our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows will not change based on the outcome of any unforeseen future developments 
the mma also changed the medicare payment methodology and conditions for coverage of certain items of durable medical equipment prosthetics  orthotics  and supplies dmepos under medicare part b 
approximately of the company s revenue is derived from beneficiaries covered under medicare part b 
the changes include a temporary freeze in annual increases in payments for durable medical equipment from through  new clinical conditions for payment  quality standards applied by cms approved accrediting organizations  and competitive bidding requirements 
only suppliers that are winning bidders will be eligible to provide competitively bid items to medicare beneficiaries in the selected areas  and winning bidders will be paid based on the median of the winning suppliers bids for each of the selected items in the region  rather than the medicare fee schedule amount 
in mid  cms conducted a first round of bidding for dmepos product categories in competitive bidding areas  and announced winning bidders in march in light of concerns about implementation of the bidding program  in mippa congress terminated the contracts awarded by cms in the first round of competitive bidding  required that new bidding be conducted for the first round  and required certain reforms to the bidding process 
among other things  the law requires cms to rebid those areas in  with bidding for round two delayed until the delay is being financed by reducing medicare fee schedule payments for all items covered by the round one bidding program by percent nationwide effective january   followed by a percent increase in with certain exceptions 
the legislation also includes a series of procedural improvements to the bidding process 
cms published an interim final rule with comment period to implement the mippa competitive bidding changes on january   and on april  announced that it is proceeding with implementation of the january  rule after a brief delay 
bidding for the new round one of the program began october   and ended december  contract suppliers are expected to be announced in june  and the program is scheduled to go into effect january  the company participated in the new bidding process for round one 
there is no assurance that we will be a successful bidder in the dmepos competitive bidding process  or that reimbursement levels established through the bidding process would not adversely impact the company 
cms requires all existing dmepos suppliers to submit proof of accreditation by a deemed accreditation organization by september  mippa codifies the requirement that all suppliers be accredited by september  and extends the accreditation requirement to companies that subcontract with contract suppliers under the competitive bidding program 
the company s dmepos suppliers are accredited 
on january   cms published a final rule requiring certain medicare dmepos suppliers to furnish cms with a  surety bond  although the required bond amount will be higher for certain high risk suppliers with previous adverse legal actions 
a separate surety bond will be required for each national provider identifier obtained for dmepos billing purposes  with limited exceptions 
cms did not establish exceptions from the bond requirement for pharmacies or for nursing facilities that bill for medicare dmepos services provided to their own residents 
the company has secured surety bonds for its dmepos suppliers 
with respect to medicaid  many states are facing budget pressures that could result in increased cost containment efforts impacting healthcare providers 
states have considerable latitude in setting payment rates for nursing facilities 
states also have flexibility to establish medicaid managed care programs without the need to obtain a federal waiver 
although these waiver programs generally exempt institutional care  including nursing facilities and institutional pharmacy services  some states do use managed care principles in their long term care programs 
the deficit reduction act dra  enacted in  also gives states greater flexibility to expand access to home and community based services by allowing states to provide these services as an optional benefit without undergoing the waiver approval process  and includes a demonstration to encourage states to provide long term care services in a community setting to individuals who currently receive medicaid services in nursing homes 
such initiatives could increase state funding for home and community based services  while prompting states to cut funding for nursing facilities 
no assurances can be given that state medicaid programs ultimately will not change the reimbursement system for long term care or pharmacy services in a way that adversely impacts the company 
the dra also changed the so called federal upper limit payment rules for multiple source prescription drugs covered under medicaid 
like the current upper limit  it only applies to drug ingredient costs and does not include dispensing fees  which will continue to be determined by the states 
first  the dra redefined a multiple source drug subject to the upper limit rules to be a covered outpatient drug that has at least one other drug product that is therapeutically equivalent 
thus  the federal upper limit is triggered when there are two or more therapeutic equivalents  instead of three or more as was previously the case 
second  effective january   the dra changed the federal upper payment limit from percent of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the wholesale acquisition cost to percent of the lowest average manufacturer price amp 
congress expected these dra provisions to reduce federal and state medicaid spending by billion over five years 
on july   cms issued a final rule with comment period to implement changes to the upper limit rules 
among other things  the final rule established a new federal upper limit calculation for multiple source drugs based on percent of the lowest amp in a drug class  required cms to post amp amounts on its web site  and established a uniform definition for amp 
additionally  the final rule provided that sales of drugs to long term care pharmacies for supply to nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as associated discounts  rebates or other price concessions are not to be taken into account in determining amp where such sales can be identified with adequate documentation  and that any amps which are not at least of the next highest amp will not be taken into account in determining the upper limit amount the so called outlier test 
however  on december   the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing provisions of the july  rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program 
the order also enjoins cms from posting amp data on a public web site or disclosing it to states 
as a result of this preliminary injunction  cms did not post amps or new upper limit prices in late december based upon the july  final rule despite its earlier planned timetable  and the schedule for states to implement the new upper limits has been delayed until further notice 
separately  on march   cms published an interim final rule with comment period revising the definition of multiple source drug set forth in the july  final rule 
in short  the effect of the rule will be that federal upper limits apply in all states unless the state finds that a particular generic drug is not available within that state 
while the rule s effective date was april   it was subject to public comment 
cms also noted that the regulation is subject to the injunction by the united states district court for the district of columbia to the extent that it may affect medicaid reimbursement rates for pharmacies 
on october   cms published the final version of this rule  responding to public comments received on the march  regulation 
the final rule adopted the march interim final rule with technical changes effective november   although it continues to be subject to an injunction to the extent that it affects medicaid pharmacy reimbursement rates 
moreover  mippa delayed the adoption of the dra s new federal upper limit payment rules for medicaid based on amp for multiple source drugs and prevented cms from publishing amp data before october  to date  cms has not issued a new rule or published such amp data 
therefore  at this time upper payment limits continue to be determined under the pre dra rules 
with the advent of medicare part d  the company s revenues from state medicaid programs are substantially lower than has been the case previously 
however  some of the company s agreements with part d plans and other payors have incorporated the medicaid upper limit rules into the pricing mechanisms for prescription drugs 
until the litigation regarding the final rule is resolved and new upper limit amounts are published by cms  the company cannot predict the impact of the final rule on the company s business 
further  there can be no assurance that federal upper limit payments under pre dra rules  cms adoption of a revised rule under the dra  congressional action  or other efforts by payors to limit reimbursement for certain drugs will not adversely impact the company s business 
mippa also seeks to promote e prescribing by providing incentive payments for physicians and other practitioners paid under the medicare physician fee schedule who are successful electronic prescribers 
specifically  successful electronic prescribers are to receive a percent bonus during and  a percent bonus for and and a percent bonus for  practitioners who are not successful electronic prescribers are penalized by a percent reduction from the current fee schedule in  a percent reduction in  and thereafter a percent reduction 
cms has announced that to be a successful electronic prescriber and to receive an incentive payment for the e prescribing reporting year  an eligible professional must report  using a qualified e prescribing system  one of three e prescribing measures in at least of the cases in which the measure is reportable by the eligible professional during cms has issued detailed guidelines on the specifications for qualified e prescribing systems 
the company is closely monitoring developments related to this initiative  and will seek to make available systems under which prescribers may submit prescriptions to the company s pharmacies electronically so as to enable them to qualify for the incentive payments 
on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of this billion economic stimulus package includes a number of health care policy provisions  including approximately billion in funding for health information technology infrastructure and medicare and medicaid incentives to encourage doctors  hospitals  and other providers to use health information technology to electronically exchange patients health information 
the law also strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect personally identifiable health information 
in addition  the legislation increases federal medical assistance percentage fmap payments by approximately billion to help support state medicaid programs in the face of budget shortfalls 
the law also temporarily extends current medicaid prompt payment requirements to nursing facility and hospital claims  requiring state medicaid programs to reimburse providers for percent of claims within days of receipt and percent of claims within days of receipt 
the obama administration has issued a variety of guidance documents and regulations to implement the new law 
congress also is considering extending the temporary medicaid provisions as part of legislation designed to spur job creation  although such legislation has not been enacted to date 
the company continues to review the implementation of the law and assess the potential impact of the various provisions on the company 
two other recent actions at the federal level could impact medicaid payments to nursing facilities 
the tax relief and health care act of modified several medicaid policies including  among other things  reducing the limit on medicaid provider taxes from percent to percent from january  through september  on february   cms published a final rule that implements this legislation  and makes other clarifications to the standards for determining the permissibility of provider tax arrangements 
provisions of the rule were repeatedly delayed  currently the enforcement is delayed until june  second  on may   cms published a rule designed to ensure that medicaid payments to governmentally operated nursing facilities and certain other health care providers are based on actual costs and that state financing arrangements are consistent with the medicaid statute 
cms estimates that the rule would save million during the first year and billion over five years  but congress blocked the rule through april  the american recovery and reinvestment act of expressed the sense of congress that the secretary of health and human services should not promulgate the provider cost limit rule  citing a ruling by the united states district court for the district of columbia that the final rule was improperly promulgated 
broader changes in federal healthcare policy have been proposed by president obama and are currently under consideration by congress 
the house of representatives approved a sweeping health reform bill  hr  the affordable health care for america act  on november  the senate approved its version of the measure  hr  the patient protection and affordable care act  on december  both bills seek to expand access to affordable health insurance through insurance market reforms  the establishment of health insurance exchanges through which individuals and small businesses can purchase qualified insurance coverage  and expansion of the medicaid program 
the house version of the bill also would establish a public health insurance option to compete with private health insurers 
among many other things  both versions of the legislation include significant reimbursement cuts to medicare providers  including skilled nursing facilities  although details vary between the plans 
in addition  the house bill would require the secretary to negotiate medicare part d drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers and remove deadlines for long term care pharmacies to file part d claims  while both versions would require part d plans to develop utilization management techniques to reduce prescription drug waste in long term care facilities 
the reform plans also would increase the medicaid drug rebate level paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and expand the drugs that are subject to such rebates 
congressional leaders and the administration have been working to develop a compromise bill reconciling differences between the two approaches  but it is unclear at this time whether a bill will be enacted  and if so  which provisions will be included in such a bill 
on october   the plaintiffs in new england carpenters health benefits fund et al 
v 
first databank  inc and mckesson corporation  ca no 
cv pbs united district court for the district of massachusetts and defendant first databank  inc first databank entered into a settlement agreement relating to first databank s publication of average wholesale price awp 
awp is a pricing benchmark that is widely used to calculate a portion of the reimbursement payable to pharmacy providers for the drugs and biologicals they provide  including under state medicaid programs  medicare part d plans and certain of the company s contracts with long term care facilities 
the settlement agreement would have required first databank to cease publishing awp two years after the settlement became effective unless a competitor of first databank was then publishing awp  and would have required that first databank modify the manner in which it calculates awp for over  distinct drugs ndcs from of the drug s wholesale acquisition cost wac price established by manufacturers to of wac until first databank ceased publishing same 
in a related case  district council health and security plan v 
medi span  ca no 
cv pbs united states district court for the district of massachusetts  in which medi span is accused of misrepresenting pharmaceutical prices by relying on and publishing first databank s price list  the parties entered into a similar settlement agreement 
the court granted preliminary approval of both agreements  but later after hearing various objections to the proposed settlements  indicated that it would not approve them 
on may   the plaintiffs and first databank filed a new settlement that included a reduction in the number of ndcs to which a new mark up over wac would apply vs 
from over  to  and removed the provision requiring that awp no longer be published in the future 
first databank also agreed to contribute approximately million to a settlement fund and for legal fees 
on july   medi span and the plaintiffs in that litigation also proposed an amended settlement agreement under which medi span agreed to reduce the mark up over wac from to for only the smaller number of ndcs  the requirement that awp not be published in the future was removed  and medi span agreed to pay  for the benefit of the plaintiff class 
first databank and medi span  independent of these settlements  announced that they would  of their own volition  reduce to the mark up on all drugs with a mark up higher than and stop publishing awp within two years after the changes in mark up are implemented in the case of first databank or within two years after the settlement is finally approved in the case of medi span 
on march  the court approved the proposed settlements  with a modification by the court requiring that the change in mark ups take place days after the order approving the settlements in entered 
the court entered an order approving the settlements on march  while several entities appealed the court s order to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit  on september  the court of appeals upheld the settlements 
first databank and medi span implemented the changes in awp on september  the company has taken a number of steps to prevent or mitigate the adverse effect on the company s reimbursement for drugs and biologicals which could otherwise result from these settlements 
for most state medicaid programs reimbursing under an awp formula  the company is currently being reimbursed under old rate formulas using the new awps published in accordance with the settlements  resulting in lower reimbursement under these programs 
there can be no assurance that the first databank and medi span settlements and associated unilateral actions by first databank and medi span  or actions  if any  by the company s payors relating to awp  will not have a further adverse impact on the company s reimbursement for drugs and biologicals and have implications for the use of awp as a benchmark from which pricing in the pharmaceutical industry is negotiated  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  the impact of the medicare part d program  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company believes that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it cannot at this time predict the ultimate effect of any of these initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment
