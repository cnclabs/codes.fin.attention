table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
growth rebates some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 
software revenue we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows zes has fixed fee software implementation projects  for which we use the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition 
under this method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project

table of contents accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers  and limited credit insurance on the majority of our international revenues 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
over the last three years  our inventory reserves have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   inventory reserves were  or of gross inventory 
we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  valuation of goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual assessment during june and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  testing for recoverability under asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statement of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  or allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed of 
due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock  we performed an interim test of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill associated with our zes segment was impaired 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 

table of contents if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we perform an impairment test 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach discounted cash flow analysis  market approach guideline public company method and market approach comparative transactions method 
under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions consider sales  cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses  and margin assumptions 
the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk free rates of capital  current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment 
if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect  our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment 
the company s risk factors are discussed under item a of this form k 
under the market approach guideline company method we identified publicly traded companies  including zebra  which we believe have significant relevant similarities 
for these companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda 
similar to the income approach discussed above  sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized 
the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions 
if these market prices increase  the estimated market value would increase 
if the market prices decrease  the estimated market value would decrease 
under the market approach comparative transactions method we looked at market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment  including similarities to one or more of the business lines  markets  growth prospects  margins and size 
we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions 
these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value 
the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach guideline company method 
the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements determination with more weighing upon the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance 
the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock  we determined that our goodwill from our recent zes acquisitions was impaired requiring total estimated goodwill impairment charges of  at december  upon completion of a detailed second step impairment analysis we recorded a credit of  in the second quarter of to adjust a portion of the original estimated goodwill impairment for zes 
valuation of long lived and other intangible assets we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain impairment indicators related to identified intangible assets existed and conducted an additional impairment test of intangibles 
due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock  we determined that our other intangible assets consisting of our recent zes acquisitions and intellectual property were impaired requiring total estimated impairment charges of  at december  the intangible asset impairment charges in our spg segment were related primarily to radio frequency identification patents and patent rights 
the intangible asset impairment charges in our zes segment were related to customer relationships  technology  third party technology licenses and non competition agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio 
as stated in our written investment policy  the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  specified investment liquidity levels  and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 
the following table sets forth the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra s investment portfolio in thousands  except per share data 
as of december  interest rate sensitive instruments percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax because these securities are classified as available for sale under asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in over countries throughout the world and  therefore  at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
on occasion  we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable 
we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments
