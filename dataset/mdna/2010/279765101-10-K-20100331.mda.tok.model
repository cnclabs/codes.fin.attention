 unaudited revenue sources subscriptions data and solutions xbrl filings total liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   an improvement from cash used in operating activities of for the year ended december  this was primarily due to reduced operating expenses through significant cost control measures in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was due to a increase in capitalized product development costs which was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of net cash used in financing activities was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due to a increase in debt payments and a decrease in proceeds from option exercises for the year ended december  on april   we entered into the financing agreement with rosenthal for additional working capital 
under the financing agreement  rosenthal made a term loan in the principal amount of  to us and has 
table of contents additionally agreed to provide up to an additional  under a revolving line of credit 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the financing agreement is payable at variable rates of interest over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate with a minimum prime rate of  on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our obligations under the term loan are evidenced by a secured term note and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we are required to maintain certain collateral ratios and financial covenants under the agreement 
on april   the ratios and covenants were amended effective as of december  on march   the ratios and covenants were further amended effective december  in addition  the maturity date was extended to march  and the renewal date was extended to march  we were in compliance with these ratios and covenants  as amended  at december  and we believe that we will be in compliance throughout the financing agreement  as amended  terminates on march  unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement 
in connection with the financing agreement  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction to rosenthal 
the warrant expires on april  also in connection with this transaction  we paid our financial advisor  which represents of the gross principal amount of the term loan and of the gross principal amount of the revolving credit 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of  we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we raised net proceeds of million through the sale of preferred stock in january we may require additional capital to fund our operations and meet our longer term revenue opportunities 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
our future contractual obligations  including variable rate debt and interest estimated at  at december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating lease obligations severance agreements total critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from three primary sources subscriptions to our web services  data licenses and solutions and xbrl filings 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
revenue from subscriptions also includes ancillary advertising and e commerce revenue which is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue from data licenses is recognized over the term of the contract 
our data solutions sometimes involve some upfront one time customization fees  
table of contents along with more traditional annual data licensing arrangements for the ongoing delivery of the data solution 
in addition  some of our data solutions are billed on a time and materials basis  per service level agreements or for delivery of data 
upfront customization fees are recorded systematically over the expected customer relationship period 
we review each contract in connection with the respective governing accounting literature to determine revenue recognition on a case by case basis 
revenue from time and materials based agreements and data delivery is recognized as the data and services are provided 
revenue from xbrl filings fixed fees are recognized on a ratable basis and xbrl filings per filing fees are recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance and delivery  if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
revenue is recognized net of any related state sales taxes charged and sales taxes payable are included in accrued expenses 
several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectability of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our evaluation is based primarily on market capitalization as we have only one reporting unit 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
we recognize compensation expense for all employee and director stock based compensation awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options  stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend yields 
we recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
fasb asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adopting fasb asc  we estimated expected forfeitures over the life of each individual award and included the impact of these expected forfeitures in stock based compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted in june  fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 generally accepted accounting principles asc topic which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc as the official single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all existing accounting standards are superseded 
all other accounting guidance not included in the codification will be considered non authoritative 
the codification also includes all relevant securities and exchange commission sec guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections within the codification 
following the codification  the board will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asu which will serve to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the codification 
the codification is not intended to change gaap  but it will change the way gaap is organized and presented 
the codification is effective for our third quarter financial statements and the principal impact 
table of contents on our financial statements is limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the codification 
in february  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance within asc topic delayed the effective date of certain provisions of asc topic for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  in october  the fasb issued further guidance under asc topic specifically related to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with asc topic this guidance clarifies the application of asc topic in determining the fair values of assets or liabilities in a market that is not active 
asc topic was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  earnings per share 
asc topic requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and should be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share 
asc topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asc topic did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  subsequent events  updated by asu relating to subsequent events 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for subsequent events 
this guidance defines the period after the balance sheet date during which events or transactions that may occur would be required to be disclosed in a company s financial statements 
public entities are required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that financial statements are issued 
this guidance also provides guidelines for evaluating whether or not events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date should be recognized in the financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu amends asc topic and clarifies that  where a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets and or a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of asc topic asu also clarifies that  when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
not yet adopted on september   the fasb ratified provisions of asc topic related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
asc topic amends prior guidance and requires an entity to apply the relative selling price allocation method in order to estimate the selling price for all units of accounting  including delivered items  when vendor specific objective evidence or acceptable third party evidence does not exist 
these provisions contained within asc topic are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or which contain material modifications in fiscal years beginning on or after june   applied prospectively 
earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact that these provisions within asc topic will have on our consolidated financial statements 
during october  the fasb issued asu which amended guidance contained within asc topic related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the amendments in this update establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
these amendments also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of 
table of contents revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the guidance in this update will require that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the amendments in this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the potential impact that these provisions within asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
during january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu includes new disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements  including transfers in and out of levels and and information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level fair value measurements 
this update also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to levels of disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures are required in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except the disclosures relating to level activity are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that these provisions within asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we generally invest in short term  low risk instruments 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
