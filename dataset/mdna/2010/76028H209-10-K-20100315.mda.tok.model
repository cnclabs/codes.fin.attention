item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview repros therapeutics inc the company  rprx  repros  or we  us or our was organized on august  we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule drugs for major unmet medical needs 
our current product pipeline with the respective status of development consists of the following androxal male reproductive health completed phase b proof of concept trial in men being treated for low testosterone levels who want to improve or maintain their fertility and or sperm number and function  and our investigational new drug application  or ind  for the study of oral androxal in the treatment of hypogonadal men with type diabetes was accepted by the fda and  thus  we may initiate a phase a trial 
proellex female reproductive health all ongoing clinical trial activities for proellex have been put on hold by the fda 
any further development efforts for either of our product candidates is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital 
we also continue to maintain our patent portfolio of our phentolamine based products for the treatment of sexual dysfunction and try to create value from these assets in various ways which includes product out licensing 
our primary product candidate  androxal the trans isomer of clomiphene  is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound 
we are developing androxal for men of reproductive age with low testosterone levels who want to improve or maintain their fertility and or sperm function while being treated for low testosterone 
in addition  we submitted a new ind to the division of metabolic and endocrine products  or dmep  for the investigation of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
on february   we received confirmation from the dmep that our new ind was accepted and  as a result  we may initiate a phase a trial 
this new indication replaces our previously announced plan to develop androxal in men with adult onset idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  or aihh  with concomitant plasma glucose and lipid elevations  all of which are components of metabolic syndrome 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a patient phase b proof of concept clinical trial za for a new indication in which we are monitoring the effects of androxal on male fertility and testicular function in patients being treated for low testosterone as compared to testim  a popular marketed topical testosterone medication 
on october  we announced that androxal was able to maintain sperm counts in men being treated for their low testosterone levels 
testim resulted in suppressed sperm levels while men were being treated with that topical gel 
we requested a meeting with the fda to discuss such results 
in correspondence leading up to such meeting  the fda stated that it could not agree with such proposed indication for androxal at that time because the patient population had not been adequately defined and that it was not aware of certain data to support our position 
on january   we participated in a teleconference with the fda relating to the future clinical path for androxal 
during such teleconference  the fda requested that we i propose a label that better defines the population of individuals for whom we believe will benefit from the use of androxal and ii conduct a literature review of the incidence of infertility associated with the use of exogenous testosterone as supportive of our data 
the fda suggested that if it finds the submission appropriate  no additional clarifying meeting regarding this indication for androxal may be required 
on february   we announced that we submitted the requested information to the fda and we are currently awaiting the fda s response to such submissions 
given that there is currently an acceptable treatment regimen for men with low testosterone  there is significant uncertainty as to whether or not an additional approach such as androxal would be approved by the fda or accepted in the market 
at this time it is too early in the clinical development process to estimate when or even if an nda for androxal will be submitted for this indication 
in april  we submitted a white paper  based on the results from a previously conducted non pivotal phase clinical trial za with androxal for the treatment of testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism  to the division of reproductive and urology products 
the data we believe demonstrated that in subjects with a serum glucose of greater than or equal to mg dl  there was a statistically significant reduction in fasting serum glucose and a higher response rate to treatment in the androxal group than the placebo or androgel groups 
in november  after the fda reviewed this paper we received guidance from them suggesting that we open a new ind with the division of metabolic and endocrine products  or dmep  for the investigation of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes in mellitus 
in december  we submitted a new ind to the dmep for the investigation of androxal for such purpose 
on february   we received confirmation from the dmep that our new ind was accepted and  as a result  we may initiate a phase a trial 
this new indication replaces our previously announced plan to develop androxal in men with adult onset idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  or aihh  with concomitant plasma glucose and lipid elevations  all of which are components of metabolic syndrome 
proellex  our product candidate for female reproductive health  is a new chemical entity that acts as a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and is being developed for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
however  as a result of the recent liver toxicity exhibited by proellex in our previous phase and clinical trials to endometriosis and uterine fibroids  respectively  all ongoing clinical trial activities have been put on hold by the fda 
there is currently no fda approved orally administered drug treatment for the long term treatment of uterine fibroids or endometriosis 
our estimates regarding the timing of our proellex clinical development program are completely on hold at this time in light of the fda clinical hold and our recent discontinuation of ongoing clinical trials 
in addition  any future development efforts are totally dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or find an appropriate partner to proceed and on decisions by the fda regarding the current clinical hold on proellex clinical trials 
if the fda were to lift the clinical hold on proellex  and if the fda requires a lower dosage of proellex to be used for future clinical trials  we would be required to commence phase studies again with the required lower dosage  thereby resulting in extensive additional costs and delays 
the length of time required to complete phase  phase and phase clinical trials and long term open label safety trials may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical  trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
we have also  in the past  had difficulty recruiting patients into our proellex clinical trials primarily due to the various test procedures that are required  including multiple endometrial biopsies 
recruiting patients would likely be even more difficult due to the recent liver toxicity exhibited by proellex 
we also continue to maintain our patent portfolio of our phentolamine based products for the treatment of sexual dysfunction 
we continue to try to create value from these assets in various ways which includes product out licensing 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking  and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients  and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates 
we do  however  expect these costs to decrease in year as compared to year due to the clinical hold on proellex 
continued development of either of our programs is contingent on raising additional capital 
as with most biotechnology companies with drug candidates in development  the path to marketing approval by the us food and drug administration  or the fda  and comparable foreign agencies for each such candidate is long and uncertain 
the regulatory process  both domestically and abroad  is a multi year process with no certainty when and if a drug candidate will be approved for commercial use 
the development path for a particular drug candidate typically includes a variety of clinical trials 
while we have a general estimate of the timeframe for our clinical trials  the actual anticipated completion dates for each of our drug candidates are uncertain due to a wide variety of risks  including those described in the risk factors in this form k 
the length of time for a clinical trial may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
a clinical hold  can also result in unpredictable delays and added costs 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we  or a potential partner  complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
similarly  we do not have a reasonable basis to predict when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates to any material extent and in fact may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of the company s drug candidates  see the section titled risk factors 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  and depend  among other factors  on our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million and had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded our activities to date primarily from equity financings and corporate collaborations 
based on our current planned clinical programs  we will need to raise additional capital during the first half of we believe we can secure additional cash resources through the sale of our equity securities  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise sufficient capital 
failure to raise sufficient funds will likely result in either bankruptcy or the dissolution of the company 
the uncertainties relating to the foregoing matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under our ticker symbol  rprx 
we are an accelerated filer and are subject to additional financial regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley  which requires us to include in this annual report a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
these additional activities have resulted in increased costs to us and will result in future increased costs as we maintain compliance with these requirements 
we have full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 
the value of the tax asset associated with the december  accumulated deficit can be substantially diminished in value to us due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  among other things  on successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
investments management determines the appropriate classification of investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each subsequent balance sheet date 
debt securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
securities we designate as trading securities are recorded at fair value 
gains and losses on trading securities  realized and unrealized  are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method 
any other securities are classified as available for sale 
due to the volatility of the financial markets at december   we had no marketable securities and held our cash in either an insured bank account or a money market mutual fund backed by us government issued securities 
prior to the disruption of the financial markets  our investments typically included corporate bonds and notes  euro dollar bonds  taxable auction securities and asset backed securities 
our policy is to require minimum credit ratings of a a and a p with maturities of up to three years  excluding taxable auction securities 
these securities were classified as trading securities and were valued in our financial statements at their fair value 
our policy required that the average life of the investment portfolio  excluding taxable auction securities  may not exceed months 
capitalized patent costs the company capitalizes the cost associated with building its patent library for its androxal and proellex products 
as of december  and  other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of  and  respectively 
patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over the lesser of years or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent cost expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
all of the  in capitalized patent costs as of december  related to androxal patent and patent application costs 
we review capitalized patent and patent application costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
due to the clinical hold on proellex and the uncertainty of future cash flows related to the proellex patent applications  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in related to these patent applications 
additionally  the company concluded that it will no longer seek to protect the specific matter covered in certain androxal patent applications and recorded an impairment charge of approximately  to abandon these patent applications 
these charges were recorded in research and development expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining capitalized patent and patent application costs relating to androxal can continue to be used  outlicensed or sold to third parties for at least an amount management believes is sufficient to recover the carrying value of the capitalized patent costs 
should the company not continue development of androxal or should the company not continue as a going concern  the remaining capitalized patent and patent application costs may not be recoverable  which would result in charges to operating results in future periods 
accrued expenses we estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for clinical trials  preclinical development and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials or services provided and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in our trials  and we recognize this cost over the estimated term of the study based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
due to the clinical hold on proellex and our current financial condition  any further development of our product candidates is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital 
as a result  we anticipate that our estimated accruals for clinical services will be significantly reduced in future periods 
however  subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations 
r d expense research and development  or r d  expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
share based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans at december   the non employee directors stock option plan  or director plan and the stock option plan  or plan 
accounting standards generally require the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
income taxes we have had losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in accounting standards require the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  if the company has an opportunity to use this nol to off set tax liabilities in the future  the use of this asset would be restricted based on internal revenue service  state and local nol use guidelines 
the company s public offerings completed on february   october   september   october   and the issuances of unregistered shares as part of the october  settlement agreement and subsequent settlement agreements may have created a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes 
the company has not undertaken a study to determine if this has occurred 
a change in ownership for federal income tax purposes may result in a limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued new accounting guidance which defines fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of this new guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  the implementation of this guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities  effective january   did not have a material impact on repros consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the implementation of this guidance for nonfinancial assets  effective january   and nonfinancial liabilities did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events and incorporates this guidance into accounting literature 
this guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual period ending after june  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues and other income total revenues and other income increased to  in as compared to  for this increase was primarily due to an increase of  in other income  offset by a decrease in interest income of  the company recognized  in non cash other income related to debt relief from settlements with certain vendors in the fourth quarter of the decrease in interest income is due to lower combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and reduced interest rate yields that have occurred as we moved our cash investments solely into money market mutual fund 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include contracted services relating to our clinical product development activities which include preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs and bulk manufacturing scale up activities and bulk active ingredient purchases for preclinical and clinical trials primarily relating to our two products in clinical development  which are proellex and androxal

the major use of cash for operating activities during was to fund our clinical development programs and associated administrative costs  partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses  non cash stock based compensation and a non cash patent impairment charge 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the costs associated with the suspension of dosing in our clinical trials relating to proellex and the potential costs to reestablish the dosing in such clinical trials should the fda s clinical hold be lifted  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of our products  our ability to successfully defend ourself in the recently filed class action lawsuits  our ability to realize a clear clinical path for androxal  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by development stage companies  the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the costs associated with any future collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing or other funding arrangements  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the success of our potential future sales and marketing programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting and defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions of our planned business  and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company
