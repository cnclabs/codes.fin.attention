many nations have adopted or are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations  canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions  and the united states has passed a bill in the house of representatives and a bill has been introduced in the senate 
such regulations may entail substantial capital expenditures  restrict production and raise the price of coal and other carbon based energy sources 
some foreign nations such as china and india are not aggressively pursuing regulation of co and integrated steel producers in such countries may achieve a competitive advantage over u

blast furnace injection of coal  natural gas and self generated coke oven gas is also used at certain flat rolled and usse facilities to reduce coke usage 
the increase in coke production in was mainly due to the inclusion of production at lake erie works and hamilton works for the entire year following the ussc acquisition in the decrease in coke production in resulted from the temporary idling of cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant  granite city works  hamilton works and lake erie works for part of the year as well as the shut down of three coke batteries at the clairton plant 
production had been decreasing over the last several years due mainly to the shut down of one of the coke batteries at gary works in over the next five years  as some of our north american coke batteries approach the end of their expected useful lives  our production capability is likely to decrease absent additional investment in coke or coke substitute production facilities

these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision

the european union has established greenhouse gas regulations 
canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions as discussed below 
in the united states  the house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act also known as the waxman markey bill on june  similar legislation is under consideration by the senate in the form of a bill proposed by senators boxer and kerry on september  these bills would establish a national cap and trade program to be phased in beginning in that would require entities emitting greenhouse gases or in some instances the producers of fuels that would result in such emissions to present allowances that account for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent coe emitted  subject to yearly national caps on overall emissions from covered sources 
the bills include provisions that would grant limited relief  including the allocation of free allowances  for qualifying energy intensive and trade sensitive industries  for which iron and steel producers should qualify 
it is uncertain when the senate will act on these matters 
if this or similar legislation is adopted  it could have far ranging economic and operational consequences for u

it is impossible to estimate the timing of final legislation or its impact on u 
s 
steel  although it could be significant 
such regulations may entail substantial capital expenditures  restrict production  and raise the price of coal and other carbon based energy sources 
the epa has classified co as a harmful gas 
the epa has implemented a new greenhouse gas emission inventory and reporting requirement for all facilities emitting  metric tons or more per year of coe greenhouse gases 
the regulation requires facilities to collect information on coe and report emissions to the epa starting in january of  covering the calendar year 
it is expected that most u

the epa expects to have the new regulation in place by the first quarter of evaluating the cost of compliance with this proposed regulation is not possible until the epa has addressed all public comments 
to comply with the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec has created an emissions trading system ets 
under the ets  the ec establishes co emissions limits for every eu member state and approves grants of co emission allowances to individual emitting facilities pursuant to national allocation plans that are proposed by each of the member states 
the allowances can be bought and sold by emitting facilities to cover the quantities of co they emit in their operations 
in july  following approval by the ec of slovakia s national allocation plan for the trading period nap ii  slovakia granted ussk more co 

allowances per year than ussk received for the to trading period 
based on actual carbon emissions to date  we believe that ussk will have sufficient allowances for the nap ii period without purchasing additional allowances

the plan would set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by on march   canada s federal government published details of its regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions the framework 
the plan and the framework provide that facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent below their baseline by  with a further two percent reduction in each following year 
the framework provided that newer and future facilities would be subject to phased in two percent annual emissions intensity reduction obligations and clean fuel standards 
companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options which include carbon trading  offsets and credit for early action between and 
the framework effectively exempts fixed process emissions of co  which could exclude certain iron and steel producing co emissions from mandatory reductions 
more recently  the federal government has indicated that it may reconsider its proposed intensity based approach in light of potential us legislation which may impose emission caps and import duties on countries which do not have a comparable regime 
on june   canada s federal government released for comment two draft guides related to the establishment of an offset system in canada 
these draft documents propose rules and provide guidance on the requirements and processes to create offset credits and the requirements and processes to verify the eligible greenhouse gas reductions achieved from an offset project 
canada s federal government has stated that  once in place  the offset system will establish tradable credits and encourage cost effective domestic greenhouse gas reductions in areas that will not be covered by planned federal greenhouse gas regulations 
in december  the ontario government announced its own action plan on climate change the ontario action plan 
the ontario action plan targets reductions in ontario greenhouse gas emissions of six percent below levels by  percent below levels by and percent below levels by in december  ontario launched a consultation process towards the development of a cap and trade system to be implemented as early as in may  ontario released proposed amendments to the environmental protection act that would provide  if passed  the regulatory authority to set up a greenhouse gas cap and trade system 
at the same time  the ontario government also released a discussion paper  moving forward a greenhouse gas cap and trade system for ontario which i helps clarify the cap and trade approach being considered in ontario and the different options for elements of the approach and ii seeks stakeholder input on various elements of the proposed cap and trade system 
comments were accepted until july  the ontario government released a draft greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulation for public comment on october  the reporting regulation is intended to provide the foundation for ontario to implement a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases 
the ontario government has indicated that it plans to develop a cap and trade system that aligns with other systems developing in north america  including in the united states 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations which in recent years have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada 
in the future  additional 
table of contents expenditures will be required to comply with co emission requirements 
since it is difficult to predict what requirements will ultimately be imposed in the united states and canada  it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on u 
s 
steel but it could be substantial 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in particular  if the final requirements do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions  our competitive position relative to mini mills will be adversely impacted and our competitive position regarding producers in developing nations  such as china and india  will be harmed unless such nations require comensurate reductions in co emissions 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors have fewer historical liabilities

air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
the epa has developed various industry specific mact standards pursuant to this requirement 
the caa requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of hazardous air pollutants 
epa must also conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to mact standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks 
the principal impact of the mact standards on u 
s 
steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking and iron ore processing 
the emission limitations for ironmaking and steelmaking sources could become more stringent if epa s residual risk analysis indicates that additional controls are necessary 
epa is required to complete this residual risk analysis by the impact of this risk analysis and any subsequent changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of mact standards 
the first category applies to pushing and quenching 
epa is required to make a risk based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact cannot be estimated at this time 
the second category of mact standards applying to coke facilities applies to emissions from charging  coke oven battery tops and coke oven doors 
with regard to these standards  u 
s 
steel chose to install more stringent controls than mact on some of its batteries  called lowest achievable emissions reductions laer 
such laer batteries are not required to comply with certain residual risk standards until because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and relatively uncertain  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s iron ore processing operations are subject to the taconite iron ore processing mact standards 
these standards may change if epa revises the mact standards in response to a petition filed by an environmental advocacy group 
in addition  epa will make a risk based determination for taconite iron ore processing and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact of any changes cannot be estimated at this time 

table of contents the caa also requires the epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter and ozone 
in  epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size and in  epa tightened the hour standard but retained the annual standard 
these standards were challenged and the us court of appeals for the district of columbia  in american farm bureau federation and national pork producers council et al 
v 
epa  f 
rd dc cir 
 remanded the annual standards to the epa for further consideration but allowed the hour standard to remain in effect 
states are still required to demonstrate compliance with the fine particle standard by april  with a possible extension to april  but the annual standard could change based upon the remand noted above 
if the standard is changed  states will be required to modify their state implementation plans sips to meet the new standard 
on december   epa designated areas in which u 
s 
steel operates as nonattainment and unclassified attainment for the fine particle standard 
sips for the hour standard are due december   with attainment demonstrations with the standard expected to be made by or  with extensions 
it is anticipated that epa s fine particle programs could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel 
while the sips for the current annual standard were due in april  many states and local agencies in which u 
s 
steel facilities are located have not yet or are just now proposing sips 
u 
s 
steel is currently reviewing these drafts and proposed sips  but the impacts of the anticipated regulations cannot be determined at this time 
furthermore  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of any costs associated with the sips for the hour standard or the remand of the annual standard since the state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation for the hour standard 
demonstrating attainment with the hour standard is not expected until sometime between and and no new standard or associated timeline has been established for the annual standard 
effective may  epa lowered its ground level ozone air quality standards  which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  including coke plants  and iron and steel facilities 
epa is required to issue final designations of attainment  nonattainment and unclassifiable areas no later than march unless there is insufficient information to make these designation decisions 
in that case  epa will issue designations no later than march states must submit sips outlining how they will reduce pollution to meet the standards by a date that is no later than three years after epa s final designations 
if epa issues designations in or  these plans would be due no later than or  respectively 
states are required to meet the standards by deadlines that may vary based on the severity of the problem in the area 
it is anticipated that the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time since the implementation dates are unknown and distant

risk factors risk factors concerning the current global recession all segments of our business have been impacted by the global recession and such impacts have created certain new risks and have also affected the other risks set forth below 
u 
s 
steel and its end product markets continue to be impacted by the global recession 
for full year  u 
s 
steel reported a net loss of  million  or per diluted share 
raw steel production in our north american flat rolled segment averaged percent of capability in as compared to percent and percent of cabability in and  respectively  and our european usse segment averaged percent of capability in as compared to percent and percent of capability in and  respectively 
our tubular segment shipped thousand tons in as compared to million tons in despite some signs of economic recovery  we expect to report an overall operating loss for the first quarter of our flat rolled and usse segments sell to the automotive  service center  converter  appliance and construction related industries  all of which experienced substantially lower customer demand in due to the ongoing global recession 
prices for both oil and natural gas have fallen dramatically from their levels and this has led to a substantial decrease in oil and gas drilling activity  which has resulted in lower customer demand for the products of our tubular segment 
u 
s 
steel s operating levels will remain at depressed levels until our customers demand increases 
in addition to reduced demand in our end product markets  we believe that some of our customers are experiencing difficulty in obtaining credit or maintaining their ability to qualify for trade credit insurance  resulting in a further reduction in purchases and an increase in our credit risk exposure 
the duration of the recession and the trajectory of the recovery for these industries may have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 
in addition  the expiration of governmental stimulus programs may have a negative impact on the levels of customer demand 
in response to the global recession  we announced that we had substantially reduced our planned capital expenditures for to conserve liquidity 
only limited progress was made in on certain projects of long 
table of contents term strategic importance  as we focused on non discretionary environmental and other infrastructure projects 
unless the current economic situation continues to improve  we may have to delay investments of long term strategic importance 
it could also become more expensive to complete these deferred investments at a later date 
moreover  delaying these long term strategic investments could have a negative impact on our cost structure and market position 
u 
s 
steel is incurring and will continue to incur facility carrying costs when production capacity is temporarily idled and increased costs as we resume production at idled facilities 
during  u 
s 
steel temporarily idled significant production facilities in all three of our segments in response to economic conditions and customer demand 
we continue to incur certain facility carrying costs which could not be eliminated even though the facilities were idled  resulting in higher unit production costs for all three segments 
for example  during in our north american flat rolled and tubular segments  we incurred approximately million and million of idled facility costs  respectively 
furthermore  we transferred raw materials to operating locations  and delayed discretionary repair and maintenance and other expenditures while facilities were temporarily idled to minimize costs and preserve liquidity during the idling period 
as we restart facilities  we are incurring increased costs to replenish raw material inventories  prepare the previously idled facilities for operation  perform the required repair and maintenance  complete capital projects and prepare employees to safely return to work and resume production responsibilities 
u 
s 
steel may need to substantially increase working capital when market conditions and order levels improve 
as our business deteriorated  we reduced working capital by billion in when market conditions and order levels improve we may have to increase our working capital substantially  as it will take several months for new orders to be translated into cash receipts 
in general  availability under our five year million revolving credit facility  which was amended and restated in  amended credit agreement is limited to a monthly borrowing base of certain eligible domestic inventory and availability under our receivables purchase agreement rpa is limited to eligible receivables 
we may not have sufficient eligible inventory and receivables to borrow the amounts we need 
u 
s 
steel may face increased risks of customer and supplier defaults 
there is an increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of our customers and suppliers  including their need to increase working capital as their businesses improve 
we believe some of our customers and suppliers may not have sufficient credit available to them  which could delay payments from customers  result in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling  or to be unable to fill  our needs 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity investees are also being affected by the current global recession 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity affiliates are also engaged in the production of steelmaking raw materials and finishing of flat rolled and tubular products 
as such they face many of the same issues we do 
since these entities are smaller than u 
s 
steel  they may have fewer resources available to them to respond to the current global recession 
risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is highly cyclical  and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow  especially during periods of economic weakness 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess global supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 

table of contents rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies may grow faster than real demand in those economies  which may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by rapidly increasing steel production capability in those countries and published reports state that further capacity increases are likely 
steel production  especially in china  has expanded rapidly and appears to be well in excess of china s home market demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any excess chinese supply could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets 
since the chinese steel industry is largely government owned  it has not been as adversely impacted by the current global recession  and it can make production and sales decisions for non market reasons 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
imports of tubular products to the united states increased significantly beginning in oil country tubular goods octg imports accounted for a large share of the growth  as they have more than doubled over levels 
imports of octg from china registered the most dramatic increase as they grew from thousand tons in to nearly million tons in the us market experienced a surge in tubular imports in the second half of that resulted in record octg inventories by the end of the year  which affected demand in and is continuing to affect demand in chinese imports of seamless standard line and pressure pipe increased by more than percent in the three months after the filing of antidumping and counterveiling duty petitions in september  as compared to the three months prior to the filing 
imports of flat rolled steel to canada accounted for an estimated percent of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products in  percent in and percent in total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu the countries currently comprising the european union eu were percent of the eu market in  percent in and percent in increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets 
imports into the united states  canada and the eu have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances relief has not been received 
when received  such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary recision or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate 
limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays or defaults by suppliers  shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or disruption of rail lines  waterways or natural gas transmission lines  resulting in production curtailments 
we do not produce enough coke to meet our global requirements and our coke production capability is likely to decline over the next several years given that some of our existing coke batteries in the united states are approaching the end of their useful lives 
as a result  we may be further exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of coke from third parties 
usse is dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in russia and transported through ukraine 
usse experienced natural gas supply curtailments during russia s suspension of natural gas shipments to europe in january resulting steel production curtailments and escalated costs have reduced profit margins  and any future curtailments and escalated costs may reduce profit margins 

table of contents environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the eu  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations  particularly china  have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations  canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions  and the united states has passed a bill in the house of representatives and a bill has been introduced in the senate 
for a discussion of these  see part i business environmental matters 
we cannot predict the final requirements that may be adopted in the united states and canada  or the form of future actions that may be taken by the eu  however  such limitations could entail substantial capital expenditures  restrict production  and raise the price of coal and other carbon based energy sources  which could have a negative effect on results of operations and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
also  since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may also be at a competitive disadvantage with certain foreign steel producers 
many of our customers in the united states  canada and europe may experience similar impacts  which could result in decreased demand for our products 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations our retiree health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we maintain defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering most of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
at december   on an accounting basis  u 
s 
steel s retiree medical and life insurance plans were underfunded billion and our pension plans were underfunded by billion 
most of our employee benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans are controlled under erisa and other government regulations 
minimum contributions to u 
s 
steel canada ussc pension plans are governed by an agreement entered into by stelco inc stelco and the province of ontario that u 
s 
steel assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of stelco 
this agreement requires defined annual contributions until the earlier of full solvency funding for the four main plans or until december   when minimum funding requirements for the plans resume under the provincial pension legislation 
substantial cash contributions may be required to fund these benefit plans 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer plan in the united states covering pensions for usw represented workers formerly employed by national steel and workers hired after may we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of this plan  which may have a negative effect on our cash flows 
the collective 
table of contents bargaining agreements with the usw entered into effective september  the cbas increased our required contributions to this plan from to per hour 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of this plan 
total costs for these benefit plans are expected to be approximately million in  a decrease of million from  while cash contributions for these benefit plans are expected to be approximately million in  exclusive of any voluntary contributions we might choose to make 
the turmoil in financial markets during has led to significant declines in the value of equity investments that are held by the trusts under our pension plans and the trust to pay for retiree health care and life insurance benefits 
while some of these losses were recovered in  the losses have contributed to the underfunded position at december  we may be required or may choose to make substantial contributions to these plans 
many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates  therefore  our costs are not expected to decline as a result of the global recession or any other future economic downturns 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our results of operations and cash flows 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
for example  we recorded a charge of million in in connection with the expanded scope of remediation at our former geneva works bringing the total liability for this site to million as of december  environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters and hot strip mills 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
production at usse was curtailed in january due to the suspension of natural gas deliveries to europe from russia transported through ukraine and we remain vulnerable to this risk 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes or other bodies of water 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in prices for raw materials  energy  and steel 
approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled segment sales in the united states are based on sales contracts with volume commitments and durations of at least one quarter  while lesser percentages of tubular and usse segment sales are made pursuant to such contacts 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price 
table of contents that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index and do not always have firm volume commitments 
during periods of rapid escalation of raw materials  energy and other costs such as was experienced in  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with existing fixed price agreements 
conversely  some purchase contracts require annual commitments and in periods of rapid decline  such as  u 
s 
steel may be faced with having agreed to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that are above the then current market price or in greater volumes than required 
if steel prices decline  our profit margins on market based indexed contracts and spot business will be reduced 
declines in the production levels of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
our flat rolled and usse segments sell to the automotive  service center  converter  appliance and construction related industries  all of which reported substantially lower customer demand in due to the ongoing global recession 
prices for both oil and natural gas have fallen dramatically from their levels  leading to a reduction in oil and gas exploration and development  which in turn has resulted in lower customer demand for our tubular segment 
the duration of the recession and the trajectory of the recovery for these industries may have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
the amended credit agreement is now secured by a lien on a majority of our domestic inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that applies when availability under the amended credit agreement is less than million 
because the amended credit agreement was undrawn throughout  this covenant was not applicable  but based on the four quarters ended december   we would not have met this covenant 
the value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to meet this covenant in the future  and either or both of these situations would limit our ability to borrow under the amended credit agreement 
we also amended our million rpa  which among other things increased pricing  reserve factors and percentages  changed the definition of eligible receivables  which resulted in an increase in the amount of our receivables ineligible for purchase  and added a change of control provision 
reductions in accounts receivable would limit our ability to sell receivables 
in general  availability under the amended credit agreement is limited to a monthly borrowing base for certain eligible domestic inventory 
further inventory reductions could limit availability to less than the potential million 
if availability under the amended credit agreement falls below the greater of percent of the total aggregate commitments and million  we would also be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
this may be a particular problem when market conditions and order levels improve and u 
s 
steel needs the liquidity to rebuild working capital 
we have granted the lenders under the amended credit agreement a secured position in our most liquid assets  which may be a detriment to other creditors 
the amended credit agreement  our senior convertible notes issued in and our billion of senior notes issued in also contain covenants restricting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks 
additionally  the repayment of amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement and repurchase of the senior convertible notes and senior notes is required upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
the amended credit agreement  the senior convertible notes and the rpa have provisions that certain defaults under a material debt obligation could cause a default under the amended credit agreement or the senior convertible notes or termination of the rpa 
these terms may affect our liquidity  our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
all three major ratings agencies have downgraded the ratings assigned to our senior unsecured debt in the last year 
this has caused increases in borrowing costs under our credit facilities 
we have been required to and may be forced to provide additional collateral or financial assurance for environmental closure and other presently unsecured obligations 
these and any future downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 

table of contents change in control clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other parties to those agreements rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  amended credit agreement  senior convertible notes and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
additionally  the cbas give the usw the right to either terminate or extend the collective bargaining agreements for an additional four years 
a change of control is generally defined to include any of the following a the acquisition by a person or group of at least percent of our common stock  b a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity  or c replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors 
our operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our us operations are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the united states  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  inflation  increased regulation  limitations on exports of energy and raw materials  and trade remedies 
actions taken by the us government could affect our results of operations and cash flow 
for example  certain health care reform proposals could increase the cost of our health insurance plans for active employees and retirees and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
ussk  located in slovakia  usss  located in serbia  and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our global raw steel production capability 
all of them are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the countries in which they are located  and ussk is additionally subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the eu and the euro currency 
changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
any future foreign acquisitions could expose us to similar risks 
we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk  usss and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the acquisition of ussc was funded from the united states  as well as through the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings from usse  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each quarter 
an million us dollar denominated intercompany loan from a us subsidiary to a european subsidiary was the primary exposure at december  any future foreign acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with  million of debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contractual commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 

table of contents in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  steelmaking and steel finishing facilities 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million  operating lease obligations of approximately million that may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of a bankruptcy of marathon oil corporation  and unconditional purchase obligations  including take or pay arrangements  totalling approximately billion 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
the limitations under our amended credit agreement and rpa  described above  may limit our availability to draw upon these facilities 
we intend indefinitely to reinvest undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
our insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insured retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
most hourly employees of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled  tubular  cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the united states are covered by the cbas  which expire in september these agreements contain provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grant the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the cbas  require us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and require mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance 
these agreements also restrict our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further require that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  some foreign and non union domestic producers are not subject to such requirements 
we are at risk of labor stoppages 
the collective bargaining agreement covering the lake erie works expired in july and there has been a work stoppage since that time 
the collective bargaining agreement at the hamilton works expires in july  and we may not enter into a successor agreement prior to that time 
there are risks associated with past acquisitions  as well as any acquisitions we may make in the future 
our acquisitions of lone star technologies  inc lone star and stelco created goodwill on our balance sheet which totaled billion as of december   and which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco and lone star acquisitions in and our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined based on consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or compound annual growth rate  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
the assumptions used will have a large impact on the conclusions reached in future tests 
as of 
table of contents december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by million and million  respectively 
the lone star acquisition increased our tubular production capacity by more than percent and the stelco acquisition increased our north american steelmaking capability by percent  thereby increasing our exposure to cyclical downturns in historically cyclical industries such as oil and gas  service center  conversion  automotive  construction and appliance 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
our acquisitions in involved purchase prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
there are risks associated with existing and potential tax law and accounting requirements 
in accordance with asc topic  we have not recognized a tax benefit for pre tax losses in jurisdictions where we have recorded a full valuation allowance for accounting purposes 
as a result  the pre tax losses associated with usss and ussc do not provide any tax benefit for accounting purposes 
significant changes in the mix of pre tax results among the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
president obama s administration has proposed significant changes to us tax law 
some of the proposed changes  such as the repeal of the last in first out lifo inventory cost method  could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow if they are enacted 
we may be subject to litigation  the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period 
our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future 
for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
provisions of delaware law  our governing documents and our rights plan may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price 
we may suffer employment losses  which could negatively affect our future performance 
approximately of u 
s 
steel s north american based non represented employees retired in as part of a voluntary early retirement program and a significant number of those remaining are or will be eligible for retirement over the next several years 

table of contents over the last few years we had intensified our recruitment  training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations  but we instituted a freeze on hiring in early in response to the global economic recession 
if we are unable to hire sufficient qualified replacements for those leaving  our future performance may be adversely impacted 
with respect to our represented employees  we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retired or obtained other employment during the time they were laid off or subject to a work stoppage such as currently exists at lake erie works 
the cost reduction actions taken in increased the number of personnel and organization changes and may increase the risk of internal control failures 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are currently implementing an erp system to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project  which is expected to be implemented in several phases over the next several years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system may not be realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
we extended the implementation schedule in early to reduce near term costs 
this action will delay the realization of benefits from this project and may add to final project costs

in response to a previous written demand from the minister with respect to this matter  the company provided full disclosure regarding the operations at ussc and the impact that the sudden and severe world wide economic downturn has had on the global steel sector and all of the company s north american operations  including operations at ussc 
in accordance with the specific language of the undertakings at issue  the unprecedented economic downturn  the effects of which were beyond the control of the company  expressly excuse any non attainment of the production and employment levels targeted by the submission 
the company is vigorously defending the matter and believes that the action is without justification or authority 
asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
at december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
almost  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
most of the claims filed in  and involve individual or small groups of claimants 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel  and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
in general  the only insurance available to u 
s 
steel with respect to asbestos claims is excess casualty insurance  which has multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has received minimal payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any 
table of contents claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
in most cases  the claimant also was exposed to asbestos in non u 
s 
steel settings  the relative periods of exposure between u 
s 
steel and non u 
s 
steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular quarter 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements

s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the 
table of contents ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of  environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs will be between million and million for of these sites  will be between  and million per site for of these sites  and will be under  per site for of these sites 
at other sites  management estimates u 
s 
steel s share in the future cleanup costs to be million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
one site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel has completed the remedial design for this site and it is being reviewed by padep 
the other site is the former duluth works  which was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca under the minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the us environmental protection agency epa has included the duluth works site with the st 
louis river interlake duluth tar site on epa s national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since u 
s 
steel has prepared a conceptual habitat enhancement plan hep that includes measures to address contaminated sediments in the st 
louis river estuary 
mpca on behalf of epa has completed its second five year review for the site 
as a result  additional data collection will be required to address data gaps identified in the five year review and corrective measures will be required to address the recently discovered areas of contamination on the upland property 
study  investigation and oversight costs along with implementation of corrective measures on the upland property and implementation of the hep are currently estimated at million 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million per site at sites and in excess of million per site at sites 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining three sites are not presently determinable 
gary works on january   pursuant to an action filed by the epa in the united states district court for the northern district of indiana titled united states of america v

steel  following epa approval of the dredge completion report  will pay the public trustees million for ecological monitoring costs 
in addition  u 
s 
steel is obligated to perform  and has initiated  ecological restoration in this section of the grand calumet river 
the costs required to complete the ecological restoration work are estimated to be  in total  the accrued liability for the above projects based on the estimated remaining costs was million at december  at gary works  u

steel has proposed that the remainder of the refuse area be addressed as a solid waste management unit swmu under corrective action 
in addition  u 
s 
steel has submitted a revised closure plan for t and separate closure plans for d and the ttp area 
idem approved the closure plans for d and t on october  and december  respectively 
implementation of both plans is expected to begin in the related accrued liability for estimated costs to close each of the hazardous waste sites and perform groundwater monitoring prior to closure is million for d and ttp  million for t and million for d including a portion of the refuse area  as of december  on october   epa issued a final administrative order on consent addressing corrective action for swmus throughout gary works 
this order requires u 
s 
steel to perform a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility investigation rfi  a corrective measure study cms and corrective measure implementation at gary works 
reports of field investigation findings for phase i work plans have been submitted to epa 
four self implementing interim measures have been completed

u 
s 
steel has submitted a proposal to epa seeking approval for a perimeter groundwater monitoring plan and is developing a proposal for a corrective measure to address impacted sediments in the west grand calumet lagoon 
in addition  u 
s 
steel has submitted a sampling and analysis plan for the solid waste management areas east of the vessel slip turning basin  and a portion of the sediments behind the east breakwall 
u 
s 
steel has begun operation of a full scale groundwater treatment system approved by epa as a self implementing stabilization measure to address benzene impacted groundwater east of the vessel slip  and continues to operate a seasonal groundwater treatment system near the coke plant 
the costs for the above mentioned activities are estimated to be million 
u 
s 
steel has submitted a proposal to epa seeking approval to implement corrective measures necessary to address soil contamination at gary works 
u 
s 
steel estimates the minimum cost of the corrective measures for soil contamination to be approximately million

u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
while the operating results of our various businesses are affected by a number of business specific factors see item business steel industry background and competition  the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
following several years of strong performance  the steel industry and u 
s 
steel were quickly and severely impacted by the global recession starting in late in response to these economic conditions  our strategy has been to enhance our liquidity  maintain a solid balance sheet and position ourselves for success in the longer term 
in late and early  we idled all or portions of numerous steel making  finishing  raw materials and tubular operations in the us  canada and europe and operated our remaining facilities at reduced levels to match our customers lower demand requirements 
we continue to monitor the impact of the economic situation on our customers and to adjust our operations to efficiently meet their requirements 
our raw steel capability utilization rate in was for flat rolled operations and for usse operations 
with respect to financial matters  we reduced our quarterly dividend  completed successful offerings of senior convertible notes and common stock and renegotiated the provisions of existing financial covenants with lenders 
we initiated substantial cost reduction activities at all locations  including reducing our non represented workforce through restructuring  attrition and early retirement programs 
we agreed with the united steel workers usw to defer certain mandatory trust contributions  implemented a hiring freeze  eliminated merit pay salary increases  suspended the company match on our k program  and reduced fees for board of directors and base salaries for all general managers and executives 
we significantly reduced our capital expenditures for from the original plan of million to million by focusing largely on non discretionary environmental and other infrastructure projects 
this compares to capital expenditures of million for and million for we voluntarily contributed million to the main defined benefit plan as we still believe that this is appropriate to mitigate larger potential funding requirements in the future 
we refinanced million of environmental revenue bonds extending their maturity dates from to maturity dates ranging from to we finished the year with total liquidity of billion  an improvement of nearly million from the average of the previous five year ends

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to employee benefits liabilities and assets held in trust relating to such liabilities  the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations and potential litigation claims and settlements 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  current business and market conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
lifo last in  first out is the predominant method of inventory costing for inventories in the united states and fifo first in  first out is the predominant method used in canada and europe 
the lifo method of inventory costing was used for percent and percent of consolidated inventories at december  and december   respectively 
equity method investments investments in entities over which u 
s 
steel has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at u 
s 
steel s share of net assets plus loans  advances and our share of earnings less distributions 
differences in the basis of the investment and the underlying net asset value of the investee  if any  are amortized into earnings over the remaining useful life of the associated assets 
income from investees includes u 
s 
steel s share of income from equity method investments  which is generally recorded a month in arrears  except for significant and unusual items which are recorded in the period of occurrence 
gains or losses from changes in ownership of unconsolidated investees are recognized in the period of change 
intercompany profits and losses on transactions with equity investees have been eliminated in consolidation subject to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
u 
s 
steel evaluates impairment of its equity method investments whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value below carrying value is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  we would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value  which then becomes its new carrying value 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the 
table of contents assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel s investment strategy for its us pension and other benefits plan assets provides for a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality bonds and selected smaller investments in private equities  investment trusts  timber and mineral interests 
for its us pension plans  u 
s 
steel has a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities with the balance primarily invested in corporate bonds and government backed bonds and treasury bills 
for the other benefit plans  the target allocation for plan assets is percent equities 
u 
s 
steel also believes that returns on equities over the long term will be higher than returns from fixed income securities as actual historical returns from u 
s 
steel s trusts have shown 
returns on bonds tend to offset some of the shorter term volatility of stocks 
both equity and fixed income investments are made across a broad range of industries and companies to provide protection against the impact of volatility in any single industry as well as company specific developments 
u 
s 
steel is currently using an percent assumed rate of return for purposes of the expected return on assets for the development of net periodic cost for the main defined benefit pension plan and other benefits 
this rate was chosen by taking into account the intended asset mix and the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this percent rate and while some recent annual returns have not  it is u 
s 
steel s expectation that future periods will return to this level 
for ussc defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel s investment strategy is similar to its strategy for us plans  whereby the company seeks a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality corporate and government bonds and selected smaller investments with a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities 
a percent rate of return is being used for the development of net periodic costs in which is lower than the us pension plan assumption as subcategories within the asset mix are from a more limited investment universe and  as a result  have a lower expected return 
at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate used to measure both domestic pension and other benefits obligations to percent from percent 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which we estimate the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several aaa and aa corporate bond indices as an indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
for ussc benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices and at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate to percent from percent for its canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
much of our costs for the domestic usw participants retiree health benefits other than for most surviving spouses in the company s main domestic insurance plan are subject to a cost cap that was negotiated in as a result of the collective bargaining agreements with the usw entered into effective september  the cbas see note to the financial statements  our costs are subject to the full impact of escalation for the surviving spouse beneficiaries since their retiree premium contributions are now a flat fixed amount 
escalation applies to most other groups within the company s insurance plans  but does not apply to most domestic non union retirees since their benefits are limited to flat dollar amounts 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in pension cost for included million in settlement  termination and curtailment losses 
total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in other benefit costs in included million in settlement  termination and curtailment losses 
excluding the settlement  termination and curtailment losses  the expected increase in total pension cost is primarily due to a lower market related value of plan assets primarily due to further recognition of the asset losses that were incurred in 
table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percentage point change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension cost for discount rate incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest cost components for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
we have two reporting units that have a significant amount of goodwill 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco and lone star acquisitions in these amounts reflect the benefits we expect the flat rolled reporting unit to realize from expanding our flexibility in meeting our customers needs and running our flat rolled facilities at higher operating rates to source our semi finished product needs 
our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition  reflecting the benefits we expect the reporting unit to realize from the expansion of our tubular operations 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
u 
s 
steel completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for either reporting unit 
fair value was determined in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic on fair value  which requires consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable 
for the annual goodwill impairment test  u 
s 
steel used fair values estimated under the income approach and the market approach 
although considered  u 
s 
steel did not utilize the cost approach as relevant data was not available 
the income approach is based upon projected future cash flows discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the future cash flows 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units was estimated using probability weighted scenarios of future cash flow projections based on management s long range estimates of market conditions over a multiple year horizon 
a three percent perpetual growth rate was used to arrive at an estimated future terminal value 
a discount rate of percent was used for both reporting units which was based upon the cost of capital of other comparable steel companies  which we view as the most likely market participants 
the market approach is based upon an analysis of valuation metrics for companies comparable to our reporting units 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units was estimated using an appropriate valuation multiple based on this analysis  estimated normalized earnings and an estimated control premium 

table of contents in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization  using a reasonable control premium  was performed as of the valuation date 
we further validated the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units using other valuation metrics that included data from historical u 
s 
steel transactions as well as published analyst reports 
as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by million and million  respectively  but would still result in no goodwill impairment charge 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit under the income approach are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or assumed growth rates  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets u 
s 
steel evaluates long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows 
we evaluate the impairment of long lived assets at the asset group level 
our asset groupings are the same as our reporting units 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remained management s intention to continue indefinitely to reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 

table of contents u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as to percent

income taxes the income tax benefit in was million  compared to provisions of million in and million in the tax benefit in is primarily related to the net loss for the period 
the effective tax benefit rate for the year ended december  is lower than the statutory rate because losses in canada and serbia  which are jurisdictions where we have recorded a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  do not generate a tax benefit for accounting purposes 
the increase in as compared to primarily reflected higher income and a higher effective tax rate as a result of a lower percentage of pre tax earnings generated by our european operations 
the net domestic deferred tax asset was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in the net deferred tax asset from to was primarily a result of the remeasurement of the pension and other benefits plans see note to the financial statements 
at december   the foreign deferred tax assets recorded were million  net of established valuation allowances of million 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the euro  the canadian dollar and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for canadian deferred tax assets due to the absence of positive evidence at ussc to support the realizability of the assets 
a full valuation allowance is provided for serbian deferred tax assets because current projected investment tax credits  which must be used before net operating losses and credit carryforwards  are more than sufficient to offset future tax liabilities 
as ussc and usss generate sufficient income  the valuation allowance of million for canadian deferred tax assets and million for serbian deferred tax assets as of december   would be partially or fully reversed at such time that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
for further information on income taxes see note to the financial statements 
net income net loss in was  million compared to income of  million in and million in the changes primarily reflected the factors discussed above 
financial condition  cash flows and liquidity financial condition current assets at year end decreased by million from year end primarily due to lower inventories and lower receivables partially offset by higher cash balances see cash flows 
the decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower quantities of higher cost raw materials

s 
steel maintained lower operating rates throughout and reduced raw material purchases as a cash conservation measure 
receivables decreased mainly due to lower sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  due primarily to lower average realized prices 
these decreases were partially offset by the recognition of an income tax receivable representing a portion of the federal income tax refund that we expect to receive in as a result of carrying back our expected losses to prior years 
goodwill of  million increased by million from year end mainly as goodwill attributable to the acqusition of stelco were reported at higher amounts due to foreign currency translation effects

total deferred income tax benefits at year end remained consistent with the balance at year end deferred income tax benefits were primarily impacted by an increase in foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards offset by an increase in the valuation allowance  since a full valuation allowance is recorded for canadian and serbian deferred tax assets  and a decrease in the deferred income tax benefit related to employee benefits 
see note to the financial statements 
current liabilities at year end decreased by million from year end due mainly to lower payroll and benefits payable resulting from the absence of accruals for profit based payments and lower accrued taxes resulting from reduced net income in compared to several balance sheet accounts changed as a result of an improvement in the net funded status of our pension and other employee benefits plans 
employee benefits decreased by million and the accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by billion 
see note to the financial statements 
the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss was also due to foreign currency translation effects as a result of the weakening us dollar versus the euro and the canadian dollar

based upon currently identified projects  u

steel anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in  including million for usse  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
on july   the attorney general of canada initiated a proceeding under section of canada s investment canada act by filing an application in the canadian federal court that seeks to impose a financial penalty on u 
s 
steel due to the company s alleged failure to comply with two of the undertakings made by u 
s 
steel to the minister of industry in connection with the acquisition of stelco 
the specific undertakings at issue concern production and employment levels anticipated at ussc assuming certain business conditions 
in response to a previous written demand from the minister with respect to this matter  the company provided full disclosure regarding the operations at ussc and the impact that the sudden and severe world wide economic 
table of contents downturn has had on the global steel sector and all of the company s north american operations  including operations at ussc 
in accordance with the specific language of the undertakings at issue  the unprecedented economic downturn  the effects of which were beyond the control of the company  expressly excuse any non attainment of the production and employment levels targeted by the submission 
the company is vigorously defending the matter and believes that the action is without justification or authority 
as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active asbestoscases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
almost  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on u

in a series of lawsuits filed in federal court in the northern district of illinois beginning september   individual direct or indirect buyers of steel products have asserted that eight steel manufacturers  including u 
s 
steel  conspired in violation of antitrust laws to restrict the domestic production of raw steel and thereby to fix  raise  maintain or stabilize the price of steel products in the united states 
the cases are filed as class actions and claim treble damages for the period to present  but do not allege any damage amounts 
u

steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the financial statements

outlook for first quarter we expect to report an overall operating loss in first quarter as gradually improving business conditions begin to be reflected in our operating results 
we continue to experience improved order rates from several of our end markets 
automotive  service center  converter and appliance customer order rates in north america and europe are at or near their highest levels in the last twelve months  while in other markets  such as construction  demand remains soft  but due to the low levels of inventory and the anticipated seasonal increases in activity at the end of the first quarter  our construction order book remains stable for both north america and europe 
a gradually strengthening economy should result in improvements in real demand  while apparent demand will likely be positively influenced by the restocking of the manufacturing supply chain  which we believe is under way 
relatively low levels of flat rolled product imports  if continued  are also expected to support improved order rates 
our tubular operations are also continuing to experience favorable demand trends  most notably in alloy product at our welded operations in east texas 
at the same time  spot market prices are increasing across all of our segments in response to increased order rates and global raw material cost pressures 
we continue to believe that the us and global economies are in the early stages of a gradual recovery 
while we are becoming more optimistic  primarily due to improvements we are starting to see in the manufacturing sector  we remain cautious in our outlook for end user demand 

table of contents flat rolled results for first quarter are expected to improve from fourth quarter the benefits of increases in average realized prices and shipments  efficiencies from increased operating rates and reduced facility repair and maintenance costs are expected to be partially offset by the absence of approximately million of favorable effects from lifo inventory liquidations and adjustments to employee layoff benefits 
average realized prices are expected to increase from fourth quarter as we expect to begin realizing the impact of increasing spot market prices later in the first quarter 
increases in our index based contract prices would be realized later as higher published market price assessments enter the index calculations for future periods 
we are currently making steel at six of our seven north american steelmaking locations  with the exception being our lake erie works  which represents approximately ten percent of our annual flat rolled raw steel capability 
we expect to complete maintenance work on our largest blast furnace  the blast furnace at gary works  late in the first quarter and have all available capacity in operation at these six locations before the end of the quarter 
overall  raw steel capability utilization rates are expected to increase from the fourth quarter of first quarter results for usse are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter as the benefits of increased shipments and operating efficiencies are expected to be offset by higher raw material costs 
euro based transaction prices are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter as we expect to begin realizing the impact of increasing spot market prices later in the first quarter 
however  reported average realized prices are expected to be lower due to foreign currency translation effects 
we completed maintenance work on the blast furnace at ussk in early february and we are currently operating all five of usse s blast furnaces 
we expect our tubular operations to remain profitable in the first quarter 
however  results are expected to decrease from the fourth quarter as the benefits of increased shipments are expected to be offset by increased costs as we continue to increase production to meet increased order rates  as well as the absence of million of favorable fourth quarter items related to favorable effects of lifo inventory liquidations and adjustments to employee layoff benefits 
seamless and welded tubular product prices are expected to improve throughout the quarter 
however  reported average realized prices are expected to decrease as compared to the fourth quarter due to a higher proportion of welded tubular product shipments 
we expect increased operating rates at all of our pipe facilities in the first quarter  most notably our welded pipe facility in east texas 
these expected increases should also benefit our flat rolled operations that supply substrate requirements to our welded pipe facilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage our market and exchange rate risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas and nonferrous metals  and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
for future periods  u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain commodity or currency transactions 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the transaction is settled 
once the transaction is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u 
s 
steel s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods  however  management believes that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for further information regarding derivative instruments see notes and to the financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  through usse and ussc  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro  the serbian dinar and the canadian dollar 
u 
s 
steel historically has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
u 
s 
steel has not elected to use hedge accounting for these contracts 
foreign currency derivative instruments have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in net interest and other financial costs 
at december  and december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sales contracts for us dollars total notional value of approximately million and million  respectively 
a percent increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in a million charge to income 
the fair value of our derivatives is determined using level inputs  which are defined as significant other observable inputs 
the inputs used include quotes from counterparties that are corroborated with market sources 
future foreign currency impacts will depend upon changes in currencies  the extent to which we engage in derivatives transactions and the balance of the intercompany loan 
the amount and timing of such borrowings or repayments on the intercompany loan will depend upon profits and cash flows of our international operations  future international investments and financing activities  all of which will be impacted by market conditions  operating costs  shipments  prices and foreign exchange rates 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of our business  u 
s 
steel is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel is also exposed to price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of coal  coke  natural gas  steel scrap  iron ore and pellets  and zinc  tin and other nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
u 
s 
steel s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand  however  u 
s 
steel has made forward physical purchases to manage exposure to price risk related to the purchases of natural gas and certain non ferrous metals used in the production process 
historically  the forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas and nonferrous metals have qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption in accounting standards codification asc topic however  
table of contents due to reduced natural gas consumption in  we net settled some of our excess natural gas purchase contracts for certain facilities 
therefore  the remaining contracts for natural gas at those facilities no longer met the exemption criteria and were therefore subject to mark to market accounting 
as of december   there are no longer natural gas purchase contracts subject to mark to market accounting 
fixed price forward physical purchase contracts entered into for to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price risk qualify for the normal purchases normal sales exemption 
the fair value of our natural gas derivatives is determined using level inputs 
the inputs used include forward prices derived from the new york mercantile exchange 
a percent decrease in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of december   would not result in a material charge to income 
u 
s 
steel held commodity contracts for natural gas that qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption with a total notional value of approximately million at december  total commodity contracts for natural gas represent approximately percent of our expected north american natural gas requirements 
interest rate risk u 
s 
steel is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on certain of our non derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent increase decrease in year end and interest rates on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table dollars in millions non derivative financial instruments a fair value b increase in fair value c fair value b increase in fair value c financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities debt e f a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates at december  and  on the fair value of u

steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information see note to the financial statements 
e excludes capital lease obligations 
f fair value was based on the yield on our public debt where available or current borrowing rates available for financings with similar terms and maturities 
for additional information see note to the financial statements 
u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only to the extent that we elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
at december   u 
s 
steel s portfolio of debt included million million of borrowing under a floating rate revolving credit facility  the fair value of which is not affected by interest rate declines 
safe harbor u
