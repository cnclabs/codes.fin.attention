seasonality hotel s operations historically have been seasonal 
like most hotels in the san francisco area  the hotel generally maintains higher occupancy and room rates during the first and second quarters of its fiscal year july through december than it does in the third and fourth quarters january through june 
these seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the hotel 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  most notably convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service 
competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located 
the hotel is located in an area of intense competition from other hotels in the financial district and san francisco in general 
after being closed for more than seven months for a substantial renovation project in fiscal year  it has taken some time for the hotel  now operating as a hilton  to gain recognition as a totally upgraded and higher level property after being under the holiday inn brand for almost years 
the hotel is also somewhat limited by having only  square feet of meeting room space 
other hotels  with greater meeting room space  may have a competitive advantage by being able to attract larger groups and small conventions 
increased competition from new hotels  or hotels that have been recently undergone substantial renovation  could have an adverse effect on occupancy  average daily rate adr and room revenue per available room revpar and put pressure on the partnership to make additional capital improvements to the hotel to keep pace with the competition 
the hotel s target market is business travelers  leisure customers and tourists  and small to medium size groups 
since the hotel operates in an upper scale segment of the market  we also face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations  such as limited service hotels  during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates 
like other hotels  we have experienced a significant decrease in higher rated corporate and business travel during the last two fiscal years as many companies have severely cut their travel and entertainment budgets in response to economic conditions 
as a result  there is added pressure on all hotels in the san francisco market to lower room rates in an effort to maintain occupancy levels during such periods 
in this highly competitive market  management has continued to focus on ways to enhance the guest experience as well as improve operating efficiencies 
the hotel has recently upgraded its guest room with newer flat panel televisions systems that provide guests with greater entertainment options 
the hotel has also installed many energy saving controls and devices as part of its efforts to become greener and reduce operating costs 
management will continue to explore new and innovative ways to improve operations and to attract new guests to the hotel at higher room rates 
the hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry  which could adversely impact performance 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs  including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy  due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lock outs  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and is seasonal  increases in energy costs  cost of fuel  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings  wars and other military actions  sars  swine flu  pandemic or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel  and adverse effects of down turns and recessionary conditions in international  national and or local economies and market conditions 
the ownership  operation and leasing of multifamily rental properties are highly competitive 
the company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors 
in addition  the company competes for tenants in markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
the company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies 
the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect the company s ability to lease its multifamily properties  as well as the rents it is able to charge 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings and the desirability of the company s locations 
resident leases at the company s apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
environmental matters in connection with the ownership of the hotel  the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection 
under these laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental consultants retained by the partnership or its lenders conducted updated phase i environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended june  on the hotel property 
these phase i assessments relied  in part  on phase i environmental assessments prepared in connection with the partnership s first mortgage loan obtained in july phase i assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections  facility personnel interviews  historical information and certain publicly available databases  however  phase i assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties 
although the phase i assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability  we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company believes that the hotel and its rental properties are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties

this change was partially offset by the income tax benefit in the current year and improved hotel operations 
the company had a loss on hotel operations of  for the year ended june   compared to a loss of  for the year ended june  the reduction in the loss was primarily attributable to a one time loss related to the termination of the hotel garage lease in the amount of  which was incurred during fiscal  partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to improvements to the hotel during the current year  including upgrades to the guest rooms and installation of energy saving controls and devices 
the following table sets forth a more detailed presentation of hotel operations for the years ended june  and for the years ended june

the decrease in room revenues was primarily attributable to a significant decline in average daily room rates during fiscal as hotels in the san francisco market continued to reduce room rates in an effort to maintain occupancy levels in a very competitive market 
many hotels have been forced to adopt this strategy due to a severe reduction in higher rated corporate and group business travel  which has been replaced by discounted business from internet channels 
the decrease in food and beverage revenues is primarily attributable to decline in banquet and catering business as companies continue with cuts in business travel  corporate meetings and events 
the declines in room and food and beverage revenue were partially offset by a  increase in garage revenues due to the termination of the garage lease effective october  and the integration of those operations into those of the hotel

dividend and interest income increased to  from the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  due to the increased investment in income yielding securities 
margin interest and trading expenses increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to the increase in margin interest expense to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase is the result of the maintenance of higher margin balances 
during the year ended june   the company had an income tax benefit of  on both continuing and discontinued operations compared to a tax expense of  the effective tax rate is significantly higher for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  primarily due to a lower loss from justice which resulted in a lower amount of noncontrolling interest that was reconciled against the net loss of the company for income tax calculation purposes

financial condition and liquidity the company s cash flows are primarily generated from its hotel operations and general partner fees from justice 
the company also receives revenues generated from the investment of its cash and marketable securities and other investments 
since the operations of the hotel were temporarily suspended on may   and significant amounts of money were expended to renovate and reposition the hotel as a hilton  justice did not pay any partnership distributions until the end of march as a result  the company had to depend more on the revenues generated from the investment of its cash and marketable securities during that transition period 
the hotel started to generate cash flows from its operations in june for the fiscal year ended june   justice paid a total of  in limited partnership distributions  of which the company received  the fiscal distributions were paid in september  after which the san francisco hotel market began to feel the full impact of the significant downturn in domestic and international economies that continued throughout fiscal and as a result  no partnership distributions were paid in fiscal since no significant improvement in economic conditions is expected in the lodging industry until sometime during  no limited partnership distributions are anticipated in the foreseeable future 
the general partners will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the hotel and to set the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results  cash flows and other factors  including establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies 
the new justice compensation agreement that became effective on december   when portsmouth assumed the role of managing general partner of justice  has provided additional cash flows to the company 
under the new compensation agreement  portsmouth is now entitled to of the minimum base fee to be paid to the general partners of  while under the prior agreement  portsmouth was entitled to receive only of the minimum base fee 
as a result  total general partner fees paid to portsmouth for the year ended june  increased to  compared to  for the year ended june  to meet its substantial financial commitments for the renovation and transition of the hotel to a hilton  justice had to rely on borrowings to meet its obligations 
on july   justice entered into a first mortgage loan with the prudential insurance company of america in a principal amount of  the prudential loan 
the term of the prudential loan is for months at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the prudential loan calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately  calculated on a year amortization schedule 
the loan is collateralized by a first deed of trust on the partnership s hotel property  including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents 
the prudential loan is without recourse to the limited and general partners of justice 
the principal balance of the prudential loan was  as of june  on march   justice entered into a second mortgage loan with prudential the second prudential loan in a principal amount of  the term of the second prudential loan is for approximately months and matures on august   the same date as the first prudential loan 
the second prudential loan is at a fixed interest rate of per annum and calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately  calculated on a year amortization schedule 
the second prudential loan is collateralized by a second deed of trust on the partnership s hotel property  including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents 
the second prudential loan is also without recourse to the limited and general partners of justice 
the principal balance of the second prudential loan was  as of june  justice had a  unsecured revolving line of credit facility with east west bank formerly united commercial bank that was to mature on april  borrowings under that line of credit bore interest at prime plus per annum or based on the wall street journal prime rate plus per annum  floating  but subject to a minimum floor rate at per annum 
borrowings under the line of credit were subject to certain financial covenants  which are measured annually at june th and december st based on the credit arrangement 
effective april   the partnership obtained a modification from the bank which converted its revolving line of credit facility to a term loan 
the partnership also obtained a waiver of any prior noncompliance with financial covenants 
the modification provides that justice will pay the  balance on its line of credit facility over a period of four years  to mature on april  this term loan calls for monthly principal and interest payments  calculated on a six year amortization schedule  with interest only from may  to august  pursuant to the modification  the annual floating interest rate was reduced by to the wsj prime rate plus with a minimum floor rate of per annum 
the modification includes financial covenants written to reflect financial conditions that all hotels are facing 
the covenants include specific financial ratios and a return to minimum profitability by june management believes that the partnership has the ability to meet the specific covenants and the partnership was in compliance with the covenants as of june  the partnership paid a loan modification fee of  the loan continues as unsecured 
as of june   the interest rate was and the outstanding balance was  as of june   the interest rate was and the outstanding balance on the line of credit was  despite the downturns in the economy  the hotel has continued to generate positive cash flows 
while the debt service requirements related to the two prudential loans  as well as the new term loan to pay off the line of credit  may create some additional risk for the company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future since the partnership s assets had been virtually debt free for a number of years  management believes that cash flows from the operations of the hotel and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all of the partnership s current and future obligations and financial requirements 
management also believes that there is sufficient equity in the hotel assets to support future borrowings  if necessary  to fund any new capital improvements and other requirements 
in march  the company refinanced its  loan on its corporate office building and obtained a new loan in the amount of  the interest rate on the loan is fixed at and the loan matures in march in october  the company refinanced the mortgage on its unit apartment located in san antonio  texas and obtained a new mortgage loan in the amount of  the interest rate on the loan is fixed at and the loan matures in october in december  the company modified this loan and borrowed an additional  as part of the loan modification  the fixed interest rate was reduced to with no change to the maturity date 
in july  the company modified the mortgage on its unit apartment complex located in st 
louis  missouri and borrowed an additional  on the note 
the term and the interest rate on the note remain the same 
during the year ended june   the company improved real estate properties in the aggregate amount of  management believes the improvements to the properties should enhance market values  maintain the competitiveness of the company s properties and potentially enable the company to obtain a higher yield through higher rents 
the company has invested in short term  income producing instruments and in equity and debt securities when deemed appropriate 
the company s marketable securities are classified as trading with unrealized gains and losses recorded through the statement of operations 
management believes that its cash  securities assets  and the cash flows generated from those assets and from partnership distributions and management fees  will be adequate to meet the company s current and future obligations

impact of inflation hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors  not inflation  since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights 
room rates can be  and usually are  adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases 
since prism has the power and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis  there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation 
partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks  which may be influenced by inflation 
for the two most recent fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company s income is not viewed by management as material 
the company s residential rental properties provide income from short term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year 
rental increases are expected to offset anticipated increased property operating expenses
