beginning in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ars investments held by the company  as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids 
to date  the company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and expects to continue to do so in the future 
due to current market conditions  the ars investments have continued to experience failed auctions 
these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ars  even for an extended period of time  will affect its ability to finance its operations  including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures 
the company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments

as a result of this election  in the twelve month period ended december   the company recorded a loss of million in other income expense to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ars rights  the loss was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that  of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis 
these marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues  including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates 
because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
recently adopted accounting standards in the company adopted the provisions of the business combinations topic of the fasb codification

in the company adopted the non financial assets and liabilities guidance of the fair value measurement and disclosures topic that were previously deferred

this topic allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
such election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is typically irrevocable once elected 
the company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ars rights agreement as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the us dollar  european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company develops and manufactures its products in the united states  canada  china  france  germany  ireland  puerto rico and switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as  in  intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period  with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase  million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately million 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december   the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders equity by million to million from million at december  in the company received a subpoena from the attorney general of new jersey requesting various documents related to the financial interests and arrangements of physicians participating in certain clinical trials for or on behalf of the company
