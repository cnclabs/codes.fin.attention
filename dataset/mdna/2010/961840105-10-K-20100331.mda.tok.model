table of contents business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods  and regulatory environment  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments to be two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is a junior apparel brand for teenage girls who seek trend focused and value competitive clothing  with a target customer age of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of affordably priced  fashionable and basic apparel and accessories 
arden b 
arden b is a fashion brand at value price points for the feminine contemporary woman with sex appeal 
arden b targets customers aged to years old and seeks to deliver contemporary collections of fashion and basic separates and accessories for various aspects of the customers lifestyles 
we maintain a web based store located at www 
wetseal 
com  offering wet seal merchandise comparable to that carried in our stores to customers over the internet 
we also maintain a web based store located at www 
ardenb 
com  offering arden b apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in our stores to customers over the internet 
our online stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience and offer a wide selection of merchandise  which helps expand in store sales 
internet operations for both wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
in fiscal   and  we experienced rapid growth in both visitor traffic and our online sales  and we will continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding segment reporting  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed wet seal stores and opened seven and closed four arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed three wet seal stores and closed eight arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed two wet seal stores and opened one and closed eight arden b stores 
we expect to open to wet seal stores  net of closings  during fiscal we currently expect to have no net change in the number of arden b stores during fiscal however  if we sustain recent improved performance in the arden b business through the first quarter of fiscal  we may begin to pursue growth of the arden b store base later in the year 
we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  store leases 
we may  however  accelerate the closure of underperforming stores prior to their lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or exercise certain rights contained in the leases 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal additionally  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 
we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites  satisfactory terms and satisfactory general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints on the locations of future stores 

table of contents competitive strengths experienced management team 
although we have recently had changes among our senior management team  the current members have extensive knowledge of our business and operations  which will be instrumental in managing our company through the current difficult economic environment and driving our company into the next phase of its growth cycle

steven h 
benrubi  served as our controller for over two years prior to his appointment as chief financial officer in september ms 
sharon hughes  our president and chief merchandise officer for our arden b division  who most recently served as a consultant to run our arden b merchandising team starting in february  was an employee of our company from through  during which period ms 
hughes was involved in the formation of the arden b division and held several different merchant roles  including senior vice president of merchandising 
ms 
kim bajrech and ms 
debbie shinn  vice presidents and divisional merchandise managers for our wet seal division  joined the company in and have extensive experience in the junior apparel business 
in addition  ms 
bajrech was an employee of our company from to we are currently undergoing a search for a chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division 
merchandising models at wet seal and arden b are focused on fast fashion at affordable prices 
at wet seal  we have developed considerable expertise in identifying  stocking and selling a broad assortment of fresh and fashionable apparel and accessories at competitive prices to its teenage customers 
since rejoining our company as a consultant in february  and later becoming president and chief merchandise officer at arden b  ms 
hughes has also converted arden b to the fast fashion merchandising model for its young contemporary business 
our buyers work closely with senior management to determine the optimal product selection and promotion and pricing strategies 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically or from domestic importers 
this sourcing strategy enables us to ship new merchandise to the stores with high frequency and react quickly to changing fashion trends 
we also take regular markdowns to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
improved financial condition 
since the completion of a recapitalization of our company in may  our financial condition has improved significantly 
from fiscal through  we experienced positive comparable store sales growth  on a consolidated basis  in eight out of fiscal quarters and generated positive cash flows from operations in each of those fiscal years 
during fiscal and fiscal  due in part to an extremely challenging economic environment  we experienced comparable store sales declines on a consolidated basis 
however  in spite of these declines  as a result of our taking actions to reduce costs and more conservatively manage inventories  as well as significant recovery in the financial performance of our arden b division beginning in fiscal  we continue to experience strong cash flows from operations 
in recent years  we have increased our cash position and continue to maintain a low level of indebtedness 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes and million in face amount of our convertible preferred stock had been converted into shares of our class a common stock 
also  in fiscal   and  we repurchased million  million  and million shares of our class a common stock for million  million  and million  respectively 
we repurchased no common stock during fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents were million  total debt  net of discount  was million  and stockholders equity was million 
strategy as part of a strategic review of business operations  we have identified what we believe are significant opportunities to improve our business trends and drive sales improvement 
the key elements of our opportunities are to manage business conservatively in the near term through the difficult economic environment 
we have taken many actions to ensure we remain financially strong through a difficult economic environment over the near term and to position ourselves to capitalize on the company s growth and operating leverage 
table of contents opportunities when such environment improves 
in anticipation of a continuing difficult retail environment  our near term goals include preserving a strong balance sheet  resuming moderate growth of our wet seal division store base  ensuring our capital expenditure investments made are accretive or provide efficiencies to the business  maintaining clean inventory levels and reducing costs opportunistically 
as part of our cost cutting initiatives  in january and january  we eliminated and positions  respectively  in our corporate offices  and two and four positions  respectively  in our field operations  across numerous functional areas 
we ended fiscal with an improved balance sheet  including a substantial cash position and nominal debt 
we plan to open to wet seal stores  net of closings  during fiscal additionally  we will continue to leverage our improved inventory management processes implemented in fiscal and new systems recently implemented and expected to be implemented in fiscal  and plan to closely monitor inventory positions during fiscal lastly  we will continue to operate with a much more cost efficient  streamlined management organization by maintaining our past cost reductions and continuing to identify any new cost reduction opportunities across all areas of our business 
improve merchandise margin 
in our wet seal division  we identified and began acting upon opportunities to improve our planning and allocation function  merchandise mix  and markdown cadence in response to declining merchandise margin performance over the course of fiscal during fiscal  we will leverage our previously enhanced merchandising profiles of each wet seal store and further integrate them into our planning and allocation function 
we will also continue to improve upon our markdown cadence and size offerings by fully utilizing our markdown and size optimization systems  continue our focus on key merchandise item categories  further develop branded and private label assortments  and further optimize our expanded bottoms offerings in the merchandise mix 
in our arden b division  we will further improve our inventory management  merchandise mix and sourcing  and enhance our planning of promotional strategies across all product categories in order to build upon significant merchandise margin improvement generated in this division during fiscal we will stay focused on maintaining a merchandise mix balanced with customer needs and continue to make improvements to our sourcing processes and expand our sourcing base 
improve store operations 
our store operation opportunities include improving customer service through continuing to obtain customer feedback and acting upon it to improve our business  continued simplification and or elimination of nonselling activities  and improved performance in underperforming stores 
we will continue to evaluate store activities to determine if excess tasks can be eliminated to facilitate greater focus on sales  and we plan to employ more detailed analysis and monitoring of the operating results of underperforming stores 
improve real estate 
we will continue to seek to improve our new and remodeled store economics and address pressure from rising occupancy and store construction costs 
we will continue to rollout our new wet seal store prototype and enhanced fixturing to take advantage of a more attractive store design and enhance ease of merchandising to produce a more shopper friendly environment 
additionally  we will test off mall locations by opening a small number of wet seal stores in regional power centers during fiscal we will continue to build the pipeline for store growth and will begin moderately growing our store base  which we estimate will result in fiscal store openings of approximately to new wet seal stores  net of store closings  and may possibly begin to pursue growth of the arden b store base starting in late fiscal additionally  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 
improve marketing 
we believe we have the opportunity to continue to improve our marketing planning and our divisional merchandising strategies 
we are developing specific plans for each division for fiscal we intend to place more emphasis on internet marketing  including social networking  and will continue leveraging visual merchandising  celebrity related promotions  and direct and grass roots marketing 
additionally  we will enhance our focus on marketing our frequent buyer and loyalty programs to drive sales and increase store traffic 
improve information systems 
we will complete implementation of a new point of sale system in all stores during fiscal  which will improve system reliability and increase store operational efficiency when 
table of contents processing promotional transactions 
we will also complete implementation of an updated retail merchandising system in fiscal  which will improve merchandising decision support and increase efficiency of inventory management practices 
additionally  we will update short term and long term information systems strategies that will provide further efficiencies and cost controls 
improve physical distribution and transport 
we will reconfigure and automate our existing distribution center  which will produce increased efficiencies and lead to cost savings 
we began this project in late fiscal and estimate completion by july resume our positive comparable store sales trend 
from fiscal through fiscal  we experienced eight out of quarters of positive comparable store sales results  on a consolidated basis 
this resulted primarily from increased transaction counts and the number of items purchased per customer  partially offset by a decrease in average retail price per item sold due to a transition of the wet seal business to a fast fashion merchandising model and an accompanying change in pricing strategy 
after positive comparable store sales results in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales declines  on a consolidated basis  in the low single digits 
as a result  consolidated comparable store sales for fiscal declined  with the comparable sales at the wet seal stores increasing and at the arden b stores declining 
in fiscal  as a result of an extremely challenging economic environment and continued deterioration of the arden b business  we experienced an decrease in comparable store sales  with the comparable sales at the wet seal stores declining and at the arden b stores declining 
in fiscal  resulting from a continuation of a challenging economic environment and some merchandising misses  we experienced a decrease in comparable stores sales  with the comparable sales at the wet seal stores declining  partially offset by a increase at the arden b stores as we began to experience success in the second half of the year from the conversion of the arden b business to a lower priced fast fashion merchandising model

table of contents in fiscal  we plan to improve comparable store sales with the implementation of strategic initiatives noted above  which  among other things  includes continued focus on key trends  increased efficiencies in our planning and allocation functions from markdown and size optimization systems  improved promotional planning  ensuring inventory is maintained at sufficient levels to maximize business  and implementation of enhanced merchandising and point of sale systems 
build upon and sustain arden b recovery 
in february  we engaged ms 
hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for arden b under the direction and supervision of mr 
thomas 
in november  ms 
hughes was appointed president and chief merchandise officer for our arden b division 
since her arrival  we have significantly reduced the size and cost of the arden b merchandising organization  refined the product development and sourcing processes to include more partnering with merchandise suppliers  and adjusted our merchandise mix and our pricing and promotional strategies 
our new pricing and promotional strategies at arden b included significant reductions in price points across all categories 
as a result  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  arden b experienced positive comparable store sales results 
however  we believe arden b has yet to achieve its full potential with its target young contemporary customers 
we aim to drive further sales and profitability improvement at arden b through our distinctive  quality merchandise  unified apparel and accessory assortments  our value pricing strategy  new fixturing to increase store capacity  and continually improving the in store customer experience 
expand our online business 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through several initiatives  including expanding our customer databases by leveraging social networks and by more targeted internet marketing programs 
although our internet sales are modest compared to consolidated net sales  we experienced substantial growth in fiscal we believe our focus on introducing new channels to capture customers  continuing to increase internet marketing  maintaining a consistent brand message across both channels  and being more focused with targeted marketing will allow us to continue to grow our online business 
we are optimizing inventory allocated to the internet business to better meet the demand of our internet customers and have strengthened our buying and planning staff fully to meet the anticipated sales growth in this area 
we also plan to continue to grow our internet business through continued improvements to inventory planning  fulfillment  and customer service 
the growth in our website traffic continues to be substantial  and the internet is a key component for driving store traffic 
prior to the holiday season  we launched new website platforms for both divisions 
the new websites support advanced merchandising capabilities  personalization based on browsing behavior and past purchase history  and testing tools to measure and determine the most effective content and promotional strategies 
in fiscal  we launched website features that allow for selling to countries outside the us  customers to search for and reserve denim at stores near them  customers to invite friends to shop with them online whereby each person can control and see the same screen  customers to shop online from their mobile devices and other features that continue to enhance our website and customer experience 
design and buying our design and buying teams are responsible for identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each retail division develop fashion themes and strategies by assessing customer responses to current trends  shopping international and appropriate domestic markets  using fashion services  and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the design and buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials  and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  we have decreased our dependency on internally designed merchandise 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots  and to reduce sourcing lead times 
see also allocation and distribution below 

table of contents marketing  advertising  and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
to that end  we will continue our emphasis on visual merchandising  celebrity related promotions  and direct and grass roots marketing 
additionally  we will build marketing strategies based on past successes of our frequent buyer and loyalty programs and will place more focus on building these programs 
we will also be more aggressive with customer acquisition and increase our use of internet marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
the decreases in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to the elimination of print advertising programs and the decision not to execute certain advertising activities at our arden b division due to merchandise content issues in fiscal in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on in store promotion programs and internet marketing for both wet seal and arden b stores 
as discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases  and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program  we send e mails to participants to notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b division also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as that of our wet seal division 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise from both domestic and foreign vendors 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail merchandising receipts were directly imported from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are one of the largest customers of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored at the distribution points of our largest vendors and manufacturers  and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california  facility 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution our merchandising effort primarily focuses on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends largely on our integrated planning  allocation  and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate  and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
during fiscal  we implemented merchandise planning software that assists us in streamlining the planning process 
in fiscal  we began and completed implementation of size optimization software that will improve our allocation of sizes to better align with each store s needs 
all merchandise is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
in fiscal  we implemented markdown optimization at our wet seal division to improve the speed of moving slow product and improve merchandise margins 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to clearance centers for deep discounting and sale  sent to the internet store for selling  sold to an outside clearance company  or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our online business is performed at our foothill ranch  california  distribution center 

table of contents information and control systems our merchandise  financial  and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers  and planners comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core merchandise system is frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by a leading provider of specialty retailing point of sale systems 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price lookups  and centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory  and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
in fiscal  we installed new wide area networking hardware at all stores  which incorporated upgrades to guard against security breaches to our stores point of sale system  completed our merchandise allocation system  upgraded our financial system  and launched new website platforms for the online businesses 
in fiscal  in order to further improve gross margin through the use of technology  we completed implementation of oracle markdown optimization for our wet seal stores and began implementation of sas size optimization 
to enhance store efficiency  we began implementation activities for oracle retail point of sale that will be completed in fiscal a major upgrade to the oracle retail merchandising system will also be fully implemented in fiscal seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather  or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
trademarks our primary trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the united states patent and trademark office

in general  the registrations for these trademarks and service marks are renewable indefinitely as long as the marks are used as required under applicable regulations 
we are not aware of any adverse claims or infringement actions relating to our trademarks or service marks 
competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores  and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  nordstrom  bebe  zara  guess  bcbg  rue  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater 
table of contents financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state  or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws affecting our business 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay  or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime  and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for noncompliance with certain of these laws  and future noncompliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
in july  may  september and march  we were served with class action complaints alleging violations under certain state of california labor laws 
in november  we reached an agreement to settle the july class action complaint for approximately million  and as of february   we had accrued within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet an amount equal to this settlement amount 
we have continued to retain this accrued amount within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  in february  the court issued its order granting final approval of the class action settlement  subject to appeal 
on april   a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed 
on may   the court reversed and remanded the case to the superior court to re evaluate the fairness of the settlement  and a final hearing will take place in april we anticipate receiving the appellate decision by march in october  we reached an agreement to settle the march complaint for approximately million  subject to superior court approval  and as of january   we had accrued within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet an amount equal to this settlement 
the court has preliminarily approved the settlement and set a final approval hearing for june  we are vigorously defending the may and september complaints and are unable to predict the likely outcomes and whether such outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provisions for loss contingencies for the may and september complaints have been accrued as of january  we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 

table of contents employees as of january   we had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales and other performance targets 
all of our employees are nonunion  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business general economic conditions  perceptions of such conditions by our customers and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending have adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending  and we believe the decline in comparable store sales in fiscal and fiscal was due at least in part to continued difficult economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of the continued difficult economic conditions  we may face risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
if the conditions in the us and world economic markets remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may be unable to reverse declines in comparable store sales in our wet seal division 
our comparable store sales results in our wet seal division have declined in each of the past two years  and we cannot assure you that comparable store sales will not continue to decline in the future 
in order to improve comparable store sales results  we will need to focus on a variety of factors  including fashion trends  our merchandise mix  holiday periods  actions of competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
improving comparable store sale results has been further challenged following the resignation of ms 
maria comfort  our former president and chief merchandise officer of the wet seal division  in november we have a search underway to find a replacement for ms 
comfort  but competition for qualified employees is intense and we may have difficulty attracting individuals to serve in the role of senior management of the wet seal division 
in addition  our search may divert the attention of senior management from the business and operations of our company 
once we identify and attract a suitable replacement for ms 
comfort  we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before the successor is fully integrated into the wet seal division 
our improvements in comparable store sales and operating results of our arden b division in fiscal may not be indicative of our future performance trends  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such rate of improvement 
previously  we experienced poor financial performance in our arden b division 
following efforts by our board of directors and our senior management team  including the hiring of sharon hughes as president and chief merchandise officer  the closing or rebranding of underperforming stores  and changes to promotional and pricing strategies  comparable store sales and operating results of our arden b division have improved 
however  there can be no guarantee that this improvement of our arden b division will continue 

table of contents our company s ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially all of our stores are located in shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact shopping center traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
accordingly  consumer spending and reduced shopping center traffic remain depressed due to the continued difficult economic conditions 
as a result  mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties 
the increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations  have reduced and will continue to reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our ability to procure merchandise could be adversely affected by changes in our vendors factoring arrangements 
changes in our vendors factoring arrangements may threaten the factors financial viability and ability to provide factoring services to its customers 
although we do not have a direct relationship with factors  a portion of our vendors who supply our company with merchandise have direct factoring arrangements 
vendors who engage in factoring transactions will typically sell their accounts receivable to a factor at a discount in exchange for cash payments  which can be used to finance the business and operations of the vendors 
if the financial condition of our vendors factors were to deteriorate and certain of our vendors were unable to procure alternative factoring arrangements from competitors of their factor on the same or substantially similar terms  our ability to timely procure merchandise for our stores could be adversely affected 
this could require the devotion of significant time and attention by our management to adequately resolve such matters 
in turn  our results of operation and financial condition could suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 
in general  section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
our ownership changes in april and december resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million nols as of january   we may utilize up to million of our nols to offset taxable income in fiscal future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change also could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 

table of contents furthermore  the continued difficult economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict product demand trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we decrease the price that we charge for our products or offer extensive  continued promotions on our products  we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
the prices that we are able to charge for our products depend on the type of product offered  the consumer and retailer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors 
to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices  our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
fluctuations in our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues and a majority of our income being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues and income are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
you should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 

table of contents our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  nordstrom  bebe  zara  guess  bcbg  rue  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value  offering attractive promotional incentives while maintaining profit margins  and withstanding periodic downturns in the apparel industry 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
furthermore  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  is intense  and we may not be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us 
we expect to open to wet seal stores  net of closures  in fiscal at this time  we do not expect to open a significant number of arden b stores in fiscal  aside for replacing closures  but may possibly decide to begin growing the arden b store base starting late fiscal while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls  in particular  and within other locations is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  actions of our competitors  particularly increased promotional activity  can negatively impact our business 
in light of the continued difficult economic conditions  pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition  particularly through our promotional programs 
to the extent that our competitors lower prices  through increased promotional activity or otherwise  our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that our competitors increased promotional activity will not negatively impact our business the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases  which could result in higher rental amounts for each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal 
we may not be 
table of contents able to obtain new terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to close or relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations or may not be able to find viable locations at all 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
covenants contained in agreements governing our senior credit facility restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility contains covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict or limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 
while as of the date of this annual report there are not any secured convertible notes outstanding  we have not completed the satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture governing such notes 
we anticipate completing the satisfaction and discharge process promptly 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with 
table of contents destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
a portion of our products is manufactured outside the us as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the us and foreign jurisdictions  and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations 
we operate online stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores  ii rapid technological change  iii liability for online content  and iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in addition  internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse 
table of contents effect on our operational results  including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell  ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business in direct competition with us  iii the level of merchandise returns experienced by us  iv governmental regulation  v online security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and or customer information  vi credit card fraud  and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce and the apparel industry 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could adversely affect the profitability of our internet operations 
risks related to our common stock our stockholders may experience dilution due to conversions and exercises of outstanding convertible securities and or the antidilution protection of the securities 
as of january   we have issued  shares of our class a common stock in connection with prior private placements of class a common stock and warrants  convertible notes  and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of class a common stock 
an additional  shares of class a common stock may be issued under the convertible notes  preferred stock  and warrants that remained outstanding as of january   and this number of shares of class a common stock is subject to antidilution adjustments based upon the antidilution provisions contained in these instruments 
the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock upon conversion and exercise could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
in march  we completed a series of exercises and conversions of series e warrants  convertible notes and shares of preferred stock that resulted in the issuance of  shares of our class a common stock 
the company also repurchased an insignificant remaining convertible note balance from another holder of the convertible notes 
as a result of the conversions and repurchase  there are no longer any remaining convertible notes and preferred stock outstanding 
the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  including comparable store sales  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders 

table of contents our charter provisions and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to years old 
we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at january   we had retail stores in states  puerto rico and washington dc of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as two reportable segments representing our two retail divisions wet seal and arden b 
internet operations for wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal each include weeks of operations 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for more than three days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base for that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on certain expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that

positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset any decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income we view operating income as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross margins and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes and insurance reserves 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are recorded on a net basis 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for online sales are included in net sales 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  within net sales on the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
historically  a customer generally could return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we modified our sales return policy to allow customers to return merchandise only within days of original purchase 
we also modified our sales return policy such that wet seal retail store merchandise may be returned for store credit only and arden b retail store merchandise may be returned for cash refund or store credit within seven days of the original purchase date  and for store credit only thereafter 
for wet seal and arden b online sales  merchandise may be returned within days for a full refund 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits until we are released from such liability 
our gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
historically  due to the lack of sufficient historical redemption trend data  we had not recognized breakage on gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we analyzed company specific historical redemption patterns and determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits three years after their issuance is remote 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize estimated unredeemed amounts and began to record breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits that remained unredeemed three years after their issuance 
our net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
our net sales for fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
additionally  based upon an analysis completed by us during the second fiscal quarter of  historical redemption patterns indicated that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits greater than two years after their issuance is remote 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize the change in estimated timing of when breakage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recognized from greater than three years after their issuance dates to greater than two years after their issuance dates 
our net sales in the second quarter of fiscal included a benefit of million due to this change in estimate to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
our net sales for fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is nonrefundable 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
we have historically recognized membership fee revenue under the frequent buyer program on a straight line basis over the month membership period due to a lack of sufficient program history to determine customer usage patterns 
during november  we changed from in store delivery to e mail delivery of the program s off coupons  which eliminated the customer s ability to use such coupons at the time of initial purchases 
we believe this change affects customer usage patterns 
we also continue to test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could 
table of contents also affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of the program change and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
merchandise redemptions are accrued as unearned revenue and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points are accumulated by the member 
during fiscal  we modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program whereby  quarterly  we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns  including permanent and promotional markdowns  on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns  including markdowns related to slow moving merchandise  as of january   and january   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could result in the necessity to perform an impairment review include a current period operating or 
table of contents cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that indicates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the realization of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  based on discounted cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  currently  with such estimated fair values determined using the best information available 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  and  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded noncash charges of million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill we test goodwill for impairment no less frequently than annually  and also may test on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other retail businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use assumptions for items such as comparable store sales  store count growth rates  the rate of inflation and the discount rate we consider to represent our weighted average cost of capital and or the market discount rate for acquisitions of retail businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of our goodwill may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
based on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which considered the deteriorating operating performance of the arden b division at that time and our resulting outlook for that business  we wrote off the entire million carrying value of our goodwill  which was directly associated with the arden b division 
this charge is included in asset impairment in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  no goodwill remained on our consolidated balance sheets as of january   and january  stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common 
table of contents stock expected volatility and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock options values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees and consultants 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
this valuation approach also requires us to estimate a marketability discount in consideration of trading restrictions on performance share grants 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations fiscal year ended january  january  february  in thousands cost of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses stock based compensation change in estimated forfeiture rate based on historical experience  we modified the estimated annual forfeiture rate used in recognizing stock based compensation expense  from a forfeiture rate to a forfeiture rate in the first quarter of fiscal and  for our executives  from a forfeiture rate to a forfeiture rate in the first quarter of fiscal during these same periods  we also realized benefits from actual forfeiture experience that was higher than previously estimated for unvested stock options and restricted common stock  resulting primarily from executive and other employee departures from our company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
accounting for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as various state jurisdictions within the united states 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

table of contents deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss carryforwards nols 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized using all available positive and negative evidence  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider  among other things  three years of cumulative operating income 
in  as a result of disappointing sales results and historical operating losses  we fully reserved against our deferred tax assets 
as of january   we performed a current analysis of all available evidence including  but not limited to  generating taxable income for the past four consecutive years  including in which we operated in an extremely challenging retail and economic environment  and concluded that the evidence supports that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will be realized  and we reversed the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the amount of million  which was recorded to benefit provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal nols to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests of our common stock 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on nols occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analyses  we had ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to federal nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of those ownership changes  of our million of remaining federal nols  we may utilize up to million of our federal nols to offset taxable income in fiscal we may also experience additional ownership changes in the future  which could further limit the amount of federal nols annually available 
as of january   there have been no ownership changes since in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and this resulted in our incurrence of additional state income taxes in california and an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal and fiscal at this time  we expect to utilize our california nols in fiscal unless legislation is passed that would further suspend use of nols 
the company may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
the calculation of our tax assets involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
at january   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an 
table of contents aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
included in accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as of january   and january   are million and million  respectively  for reported claims and estimated unreported claims under our self insured workers compensation and group health plans 
current trends and outlook we currently operate in a challenging retail environment driven by several factors  including disruptions in the us housing and financial markets and high unemployment rates across all regions of the us during the fourth calendar quarter of and the first and second calendar quarters of  us gross domestic product decreased  and  respectively  on a year over year basis 
although us gross domestic product showed improvement in the third and fourth calendar quarters of  with increases of and  respectively  on a year over year basis  we continue to experience a volatile  and generally weak  retail environment 
our operating performance is susceptible to these general economic conditions  which have impacted consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending in the us these trends have led to a highly promotional retail environment  negatively impacting our margins 
if the conditions remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  our operating performance may continue to be adversely affected 
our comparable store sales decreased for fiscal  driven by an comparable store sales decline in our wet seal division  slightly offset by a comparable store sales increase in our arden b division 
the wet seal division comparable store sales decline was primarily driven by average unit retail price and transaction volume declines  partially offset by an increase in wet seal s units purchased per customer 
the arden b division comparable store sales increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in transaction volumes  partially offset by a decline in comparable store average dollar sales per transaction  which were both due to our strategic decision to lower price points approximately to across all product categories in january we made progress on several key initiatives at both divisions during we hired two new divisional merchandise managers at wet seal in july and appointed sharon hughes  formerly a consultant to the arden b business since february  as the president and chief merchandise officer at arden b in november however  our president and chief merchandise officer of our wet seal division resigned in november  and we have a search underway for her replacement 
we continue to focus on improving inventory management  promotional planning and operating efficiencies at both divisions  increasing store level efficiencies and lowering operating costs 
we will continue to take steps to revitalize sales productivity at arden b  including sustaining higher inventory levels in an effort to facilitate consistent comparable store sales growth and balancing the right number of styles and mix of price points by store 
we will also continue to focus on refining merchandise mix at wet seal  which we believe was weak in fiscal and contributed to a significant portion of the comparable store sales decline in that division 
at the same time  we will remain focused on continuing productivity and cost savings initiatives  as well as on several initiatives to improve sales productivity at both divisions 
our strategy is to return to positive comparable store sales growth  improve wet seal merchandise margins  sustain improvements in our arden b business  expand our existing retail store base and expand our online businesses 
to drive higher sales productivity in our retail stores  we have improved store layout and visual displays  and have embarked on several initiatives to improve gross margins  including efforts to optimize sourcing of merchandise  enhance our inventory planning and allocation functions  better align merchandise mix with target customer wants and improve supply chain efficiency through better coordination among and within our vendor  internal distribution and store operations organizations 

table of contents our operating performance since fiscal has resulted in increased liquidity and improved credit standing with suppliers 
however  we may experience continued declines in comparable store sales or may be unsuccessful in executing some or all of our business strategy 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period of time  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our results of operations and operating cash flow 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed two wet seal stores and opened one and closed eight arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we expect to open to wet seal stores  net of closings  during fiscal we currently expect to have no net change in the number of arden b stores during fiscal however  if we sustain recent improved performance in the arden b business through the first quarter of fiscal  we may begin to pursue growth of the arden b store base later in the year 
credit extensions prior to our recapitalization and financing transactions in fiscal and  we experienced a tight credit environment 
credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services was extremely limited 
this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
the lack of credit created a considerable need for working capital 
our improving sales trend that started in fiscal  the completion of financing transactions in fiscal and and our improved operating results in fiscal through fiscal significantly improved our cash position and liquidity profile 
as a result  during fiscal and fiscal we achieved improvements in credit terms with several vendors  and we believe  but cannot provide assurance  that we could now obtain longer credit terms with additional vendors 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year indicated

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the following summarizes the consolidated operating results of our company 
this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by reportable segment 
net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales net sales in fiscal decreased as a result of the following a decrease of in comparable store sales resulting from a decline in comparable store average dollar sales and a decrease in comparable store average transaction counts 
comparable store average dollar sales decreased mainly due to an decline in our average unit retail prices  primarily driven by increased promotional activity and an increase in clearance sales at wet seal  our strategic decision to significantly lower price points at arden b in january  and a decline in wet seal frequent buyer program membership sales  partially offset by a increase in the number of units purchased per customer  compared to the prior year  primarily at wet seal 
however  these factors were partially offset by an increase of million in net sales resulting from a change in estimated breakage for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits from greater than three years to greater than two years from their respective issuance dates  an increase of million in net sales for our internet business compared to the prior year  which is not a factor in calculating our comparable store sales  and an increase in the number of stores open  from stores as of january   to stores as of january  cost of sales change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales percentage of net sales cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  markdowns  inventory shortages  inventory valuation adjustments  inbound freight  payroll expenses associated with design  buying  planning and allocation  processing  receiving and other warehouse costs  rent  and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our stores and distribution center 
cost of sales decreased due primarily to the decrease in net sales  a decrease in buying  planning and allocation costs primarily due to the full year effect of eliminated positions as a result of the restructuring of the arden b buying and design organization  favorable impact on stock based compensation from forfeitures by previously employed executives and a change in stock compensation forfeiture rate from to based on historical analysis  a reduction in recruiting as the prior year period included a more significant recruiting retainer fee to search for a chief merchandise officer in the wet seal division  and a decrease in distribution costs due to operational efficiencies 
cost of sales was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs primarily due to normal inflation of rents and common area maintenance charges for new stores and remodels relocations 

table of contents cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales due primarily to a deleveraging effect on occupancy cost from our comparable store sales decrease and a decrease in merchandise margin 
merchandise margin decreased as a result of an increase in markdown rates for our wet seal division  partially offset by a significantly lower markdown rate in our arden b division  and a decrease in initial markup rates in both divisions  as compared to the prior year 
additionally  net sales includes a benefit of million due to a change in estimated timing of when breakage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recognized from greater than three years after their issuance dates to greater than two years after their issuance dates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general  and administrative expenses percentage of net sales our sg a expenses are comprised of two components 
selling expenses include store and field support costs  including personnel  advertising and merchandise delivery costs as well as internet processing costs 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of corporate functions such as executives  legal  finance and accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate and construction  loss prevention and other centralized services 
during fiscal  we placed major emphasis on reducing costs across all sg a categories  resulting in a significant decline in sg a in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of sales 
selling expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense was of net sales  or basis points lower  as a percentage of net sales  than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year decrease in selling expenses a million decrease in payroll and benefits costs as a result of decreased payroll hours in response to lower sales volume  improved efficiency in controlling labor hours and a decrease in claim costs in our employee health care plan  a million decrease in advertising and marketing expenditures due to a decrease in in store signage and the shift to more cost effective advertising activities at our arden b division  a million decrease in credit card fees due to funds received as a result of a visa check master money antitrust litigation settlement and lower sales volume  partially offset by increases in interchange fee rates  a million decrease in store and field travel costs  a million decrease in bags and boxes usage as a result of lower sales volume  a million decrease in merchandise delivery costs as a result of a decrease in units processed and slightly lower cost per unit due to lower fuel surcharges compared to the prior year  a million decrease in store and field meetings and seminars expense  and a million net decrease in other selling costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  or basis points lower  than a year ago 

table of contents the following contributed to the current year decrease in general and administrative expenses a million decrease in corporate wages  primarily due to reduced staffing levels from the january organizational restructuring  a million decrease in corporate bonuses based on a shortfall in our financial performance relative to bonus targets  a million decrease in stock compensation  primarily due the favorable impact of forfeitures from previously employed executives and a change in stock compensation forfeiture rate from to  a million decrease in insurance due to favorably negotiated rates upon renewals  a million decrease in consultant fees  and a million net decrease in other general and administrative costs 
however  the decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the following increases a million increase in legal fees associated with various litigation matters  and a million severance charge upon departure of the former chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division 
asset impairment change from prior fiscal year in millions asset impairment percentage of net sales based on our quarterly assessments of the carrying value of long lived assets  in fiscal  we identified certain stores with carrying values of their assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  in excess of such stores respective forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we reduced their respective carrying values to their estimated fair market values and wrote down the value of certain capital additions made to previously impaired stores 
we incurred noncash charges of million in writing down these stores to their respective fair values  primarily in the wet seal division 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million in writing down certain stores assets to their respective fair values  primarily within our arden b division 
interest expense  net change from prior fiscal year in millions interest expense  net percentage of net sales we incurred interest expense  net  of million in fiscal comprised of non cash interest expense of million with respect to our secured convertible notes  comprised primarily of discount amortization and  to a lesser extent  annual interest at  which we have elected to add to principal  partially offset by interest income of million from investments in cash and cash equivalents and a nominal noncash benefit to recognize interest cost capitalized on fixed assets 

table of contents we incurred interest expense  net  of million in fiscal comprised of noncash net accelerated interest charges of million upon the conversion of million of convertible notes into  shares of our common stock  noncash interest expense of million with respect to our secured convertible notes comprised primarily of discount amortization and  to a lesser extent  annual interest at  which we have elected to add to principal  amortization of deferred financing costs of million associated with our revolving credit facility and secured convertible notes  partially offset by interest income of million from investments in cash and cash equivalents and a nominal noncash benefit to recognize the decrease in market value of a derivative liability 
benefit provision for income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions benefit provision for income taxes in  as a result of disappointing sales results and historical operating losses  we fully reserved against our deferred tax assets 
as of january   we performed a current analysis of all available evidence including  but not limited to  generating taxable income for the past four consecutive years  including in which we operated in an extremely challenging retail and economic environment  and concluded that the evidence supports that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will be realized  and we reversed the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
we have nol carry forwards available  subject to certain limitation  to offset our regular taxable income in fiscal and therefore  we incurred cash income taxes only for the limited portion of federal alternative minimum taxes and income taxes in the state of california which cannot be offset by nol carry forwards in fiscal and also  during fiscal  we generated a nominal income tax benefit to reflect a prior period income tax overpayment to puerto rico 
segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments 
we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment 
in the tables below  wet seal and arden b reportable segments include data from their respective stores and internet operations

table of contents wet seal comparable stores sales decreased during fiscal  compared to a prior year decrease of

total cash and cash equivalents at january   was million  compared to million at january  we maintain a million revolving credit facility  which can be increased up to million in the absence of any default and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the agreement 
the revolving credit facility expires in may under our revolving credit facility  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  close stores and dispose of assets  subject to certain exceptions 
our ability to borrow and request the issuance of letters of credit is subject to the requirement that we maintain an excess of the borrowing base over the outstanding credit extensions of not less than million 
the interest rate on our line of credit under the revolving credit facility is the prime rate or  if we elect  the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the applicable libor margin is based on the level of average excess availability  as defined under our revolving credit facility  at the time of election  as adjusted quarterly 
the applicable libor margin was as of january  we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility in effect at a rate equal to the applicable libor margin for standby letters of credit and of the applicable libor margin for commercial letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility ranks senior in right of payment to our notes 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by all of our presently owned and hereafter acquired assets 
our obligations thereunder are guaranteed by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  wet seal gc  llc 
at january   the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility consisted of million in open commercial letters of credit related to merchandise purchases and million in standby letters of credit 

table of contents at january   we had million available for cash advances and or for the issuance of additional letters of credit 
at january   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements in the revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes 
we believe we will have sufficient cash and credit availability to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  over the course of fiscal and fiscal  consumer confidence and consumer spending deteriorated significantly  and could remain depressed for an extended period 
as a result of this current economic crisis  we may experience continued declines in consolidated comparable store sales or experience other events that negatively affect our operating results 
if our consolidated comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flow 
this could also cause a decrease in or elimination of excess availability under our revolving credit facility  which could force us to seek alternatives to address potential cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 
the financial performance of our business is susceptible to the declines in discretionary consumer spending  availability of consumer credit and low consumer confidence in the united states 
volatile fuel prices and increasing commodity costs may also cause a shift in consumer demand away from the retail clothing products that we offer 
there are no guarantees that government initiatives will limit the duration or severity of the current economic recession or stabilize factors that affect our sales and profitability 
recent adverse economic trends could affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk to the extent that we borrow under our revolving credit facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as of january   we are not a party to any material derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars  and in fiscal  we directly imported only approximately of our merchandise inventories 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates on short term results would be minimal 
over a longer period  the impact of such changes could be significant  albeit indirectly  through increased charges in us dollars from our vendors that source their product internationally
