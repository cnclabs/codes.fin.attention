item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of our business in item of this form k and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with management s perspective on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
overview we create value for customers and shareholders by understanding the process and impact of clinical testing and applying our skills and experience to simplify  automate and innovate complex laboratory processes 
we believe we can thereby improve patient health and reduce the cost of care 
following is a summary of key financial and nonfinancial information we completed the olympus acquisition for approximately million effective august  we issued million in common stock and million in debt to finance the olympus acquisition  recurring revenue of  million  increased by million  of which million resulted from the acquired olympus products 
excluding the olympus products  we experienced growth in recurring revenue of in constant currency  instrument sales of million declined by million from unusually strong instrument sales in  despite adding million of instrument sales related to olympus products  reported operating income of million declined by million largely as a result of restructuring and acquisition related costs of million in  due primarily to million incurred for the olympus acquisition and million for other initiatives  effective control of operating expenses combined with growth in revenue were more than offset by the increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs  resulting in reported net earnings per diluted share of compared to per share in bec form k 
table of contents capital expenditures of million for property  plant and equipment and million for otl instruments  we had million of cash on hand and our debt to capital ratio was at december  recurring revenue  which we believe is the best indicator of our business overall strength  grew in constant currency  excluding the effect of the olympus acquisition 
the increase in recurring revenue was generated primarily from our clinical diagnostics products  driven in part by access immunoassay which grew in constant currency 
in addition to the incremental revenue resulting from the olympus business  our acquisition of cogenics contributed about basis points of recurring revenue growth 
excluding revenue from the olympus acquisition  instrument sales declined in all product areas when compared to the prior year due primarily to weakness in the us market and in emerging markets 
we expect our steady gains in recurring revenue  which represents nearly of our total revenue  to provide a predictable source of earnings expansion and cash flow 
historically  recurring revenue allowed us to generate substantial operating cash flows  which we used to facilitate growth in our business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development and business and technology acquisitions 
our otls require additional investment and increased capital expenditures 
our investment in customer leased instruments and our operating cash flow should continue to build more moderately since we have almost completed the five year transition to our otl model 
operating income declined as a result of the increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs in  due primarily to the olympus acquisition 
we also incurred million in restructuring costs related to the orange county consolidation and other restructuring initiatives  compared to million incurred in for site consolidation and other initiatives 
operating income  excluding restructuring and acquisition related charges and the environmental remediation charge  increased as a result of increased recurring revenue and effective control over expenses 
non operating expense remained relatively flat during compared to however  during  we incurred million more in interest expense due to additional debt issued in connection with the olympus acquisition  combined with lower interest income 
this was offset by approximately million in gains related to our hedging of the olympus acquisition  which was paid in yen  and for settling intercompany loans associated with the transaction 
our effective tax rate decreased to from during  due primarily to certain discrete items including settlement of tax audits related to prior years  additional r e tax credits which reduced tax expense  and a shift in the geographic mix  with more income earned outside the us in lower tax jurisdictions 
supply chain initiatives and olympus diagnostic systems acquisition as part of our previously announced strategic supply chain management initiatives to improve productivity and reduce operating costs  we closed and relocated certain manufacturing and distribution sites 
our plans to vacate our fullerton  california facility and consolidate those operations to other existing facilities orange county consolidation project were developed in and were substantially completed in  with final moves expected to be completed in the first half of ongoing efforts to consolidate operations and exit buildings allowed us to reduce our space requirements by approximately  square feet in and  square feet in we incurred million in restructuring costs related to the orange county consolidation and other restructuring initiatives  compared to million incurred in for site consolidation and other initiatives 
during  our acquisition of olympus resulted in additional restructuring costs as we combine operations for efficiency 
in connection with these activities  we recorded charges of million and million for severance and other costs for and  respectively 
acquisition related costs in connection with the olympus acquisition  we incurred acquisition related and integration costs of million and million during  respectively 
a significant portion of these expenses were related to legal  consulting and investment banking fees 
on april   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with clinical data inc to acquire cogenics  the genomics division of clinical data inc in connection with this acquisition  we incurred million of acquisition related and integration costs during bec form k 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap 
to prepare our financial statements  we make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management considers relevant 
because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
we describe our significant accounting policies in note  nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit finance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  when collectability is reasonably assured and when risk of loss transfers 
for instrument sales that include customer specific acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized when the acceptance criteria have been met 
when a customer enters into an otl agreement  lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  while the cost of the leased equipment is carried in customer leased instruments within property  plant and equipment and depreciated over its estimated useful life 
under an stl agreement  hardware sales revenue and related costs are generally recognized at the time of shipment based on the present value of the minimum lease payments with interest income recognized over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
supplies and test kit revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery or usage 
service revenue on maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement or as service is performed  if not under contract 
for those stl and sale agreements that include multiple deliverables  such as installation  training  after market supplies or service  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
the fair market value of our leased instruments is determined by a range of cash selling prices or other verifiable objective evidence  if applicable 
we regularly evaluate available objective evidence of instrument fair values using historical data 
our allocation of revenue for future sales could be affected by changes in estimates of the relative fair value of the various deliverables which could affect the timing of our revenue recognition or allocation to the various components 
our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under the accounting standard for leases  as amended  which often involves complex provisions and significant judgments 
before classifying a lease as an stl  among other things  we assess whether collectability of the lease payment is reasonably assured and whether there are any significant uncertainties related to costs that we have yet to incur with respect to the lease 
generally  our leases that qualify as stls are non cancelable leases with a term of percent or more of the economic life of the equipment 
in  we changed our standard leasing terms around cancellation provisions to emphasize terms which meet the criteria for otl classification 
as a result  nearly all of our lease arrangements are otls 
certain of our lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer and dealer relationships  developed and core technology and trade names 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in detail in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets for business combinations include future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents bec form k 
table of contents expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed the coulter brand recognition and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio risk adjusted discount rate management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as more fully discussed in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying an estimated loss rate to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
this estimated loss rate is based on our historical loss experience but also contemplates current market conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out or fifo method of determining inventory cost 
inventory schedules are analyzed quarterly by finance and logistics personnel  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
a significant decrease in forecasted demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory reserves or write downs and increased cost of sales 
customer leased instruments the economic life of our leased instruments requires significant accounting estimates and judgment 
these estimates are based on our historical experience 
the most objective measure of the economic life of our leased instrument is the original term of a lease  which is typically five or seven years  since historically a majority of the instruments are returned by the lessee at or near the end of the lease term and there is not a significant after market for our used instruments without substantial remanufacturing 
the economic life of products acquired in connection with the olympus acquisition is estimated to be seven years based upon the instruments historical experience in the field 
we believe these lives represent the periods during which the instruments are expected to be economically usable  with normal service  for the purposes for which they are intended 
we evaluate regularly the economic life of existing and new products for purposes of this determination 
valuation of other long lived assets the process of evaluating the potential impairment of other long lived assets  such as our property  plant and equipment  including software for internal use  is subjective and requires judgment 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the fair value is less than the asset s carrying amount  we recognize a loss for the difference 
to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the asset s usefulness and consider market factors specific to the business in which the asset is used and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including industry and economic trends  changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
furthermore  we may determine that our assets have a shorter useful life than our current estimate  which would result in a higher depreciation and amortization expense 
although we believe our past assumptions and estimates have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in the assumptions and estimates could materially impact our future reported financial results 
bec form k 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level that is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
for goodwill  we compare the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the assets are assigned 
in september  we reevaluated our core technology  which previously had an indefinite useful life 
we considered current and expected technological changes evolving in the marketplace  including the potential of our competitors developing newer technologies  and determined that over time these factors could make our core technology less valuable for our related products 
thus  we deemed it appropriate to assign an estimated year useful life to the technology 
our core technology assets are not impaired 
the incremental annual amortization resulting from this change is approximately million 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and potential impairment charges related to goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
if conditions differ from management s estimate at the time of acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets or goodwill may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we assess impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
environmental obligations compliance with federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where we do business or maintain properties 
we establish accruals when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  estimating 
accrual amounts based on currently available information  regulatory requirements  remediation strategies  historical experience  our relative share of the total remediation costs and a relevant discount rate  when the time period of estimated costs can be reasonably predicted 
changes in these assumptions could impact our future reported results 
income taxes we record liabilities for potential income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures 
these estimates require significant judgment as uncertainties often exist in interpretations of new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by multiple taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our effective income tax rate in the period 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and for tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
an increase or decrease to net earnings may occur if we were to determine that we were able to utilize more or less of these deferred tax assets than currently expected 
in the fourth quarter of the us congress enacted legislation extending the research experimentation r e tax credit for the and tax years 
as a result  we recorded an estimated r e credit of million in the fourth quarter of the financial statements include the benefit for the and r e tax credit 
in prior years  due to the difficulty in estimating the r e credit on a current basis  we used a method to record the r e tax credit for financial reporting purposes that resulted in recognizing the benefit in the year subsequent to the credit utilization on its tax return 
the prior method used to record the r e tax credit did not have a material impact on any of the financial statements presented 
bec form k 
table of contents pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor pension plans in various forms  and a postretirement medical benefit plan which covers us employees and retirees who met certain eligibility criteria at the end of the obligations under these plans are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon a number of factors which are used to determine the expense  liabilities and asset values related to the plans 
two of the critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other important assumptions include expected future salary increases  retirement dates  employee turnover  mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate 
we review these assumptions annually 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based upon historical cumulative returns on plan assets  the investment strategy  plan asset allocation and expected returns 
while there is no absolute predictor of future performance  our historical return on plan assets has been over 
we believe our expected long term rate of return assumption  which is used to calculate pension expense  of in  in and in  is reasonable based on our investment strategy and our long term investment return experience 
we froze entrance to the pension plan effective december  and changed the investment allocation in december in an effort to reduce the volatility of changes in the fair value of plan assets 
although the value of our us pension plan assets has increased in as compared to  our us pension plan is underfunded at december  as a result of the decline in the credit and equity markets 
the discount rate is an assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to the services rendered by participants in our pension plans 
the rate used reflects our best estimate of the rate at which pension benefits will be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments to plan participants 
the discount rates are developed based on benchmarking indexes 
the benchmarking indexes are obtained by using high quality long term corporate bond yields currently available with terms similar to the expected timing of payments to be made under our pension obligation 
the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for the us pension plan and postretirement plans was selected by us  in consultation with independent actuaries  using an average of pension discount yield curves based on the characteristics of the us plan and postretirement liabilities  each determined independently 
the weighted average discount rate we utilized to measure our us pension obligation as of december  and to calculate our expense was in comparison to used in determining our expense 
for all other non us pension plans  we set the assumed discount rates based on the nature of liabilities  local economic environments and available bond indices or a third party yield curve 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on assets eltra or discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligation and related pension expense 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change to certain key assumptions used in the calculation of expense for the year ended december  and the projected benefit obligation pbo at december  for our major us and us defined benefit pension plans in millions impact on pre tax pension expense increase decrease impact on pbo december  increase decrease change in assumption us non us us us basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in discount rate basis point decrease in eltra na na basis point increase in eltra na na our funding policy provides that payments to our domestic pension trusts will at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements provided for by the employee retirement income security act of share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
share based payments include stock options  employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  restricted stock and performance shares 
share based compensation expense is based on the value of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
we have elected to use the black scholes merton option pricing model which incorporates various assumptions  including volatility  expected life and interest rates to estimate the fair value of stock options 
the expected life is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
we evaluate and adjust our assumptions on an annual basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the accounting guidance for share based compensation in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

table of contents change in presentation we have a hedging program to reduce the risk of foreign currency changes on cash flows generated from intercompany inventory purchases 
in the first quarter of  our results of operations were impacted more significantly by currency changes  a portion of which was offset by the results of our hedging program 
to reflect this net currency impact on our operating results  we have reclassified our gains and losses related to cash flow hedging activities and foreign currency transactions to cost of sales from non operating income or expense for all periods presented 
the amounts reclassified for the prior periods were not material 
results of operations management reviews revenue by segment  product area  markets we serve and major geographic area 
to facilitate our understanding of results  we review revenue on both a reported and constant currency basis 
we define constant currency revenue as current period revenue in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s foreign currency exchange rate for that period  computed monthly 
constant currency growth is defined as current period constant currency revenue less prior year reported revenue divided by prior year reported revenue 
this measure provides information on revenue growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
we believe the use of this measure aids in the understanding of our operations without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
this presentation is also consistent with our internal use of the measure  which we use to measure the profitability of ongoing operating results against prior periods and against our internally developed targets 
constant currency revenue and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  these measures are not us gaap defined measures  and therefore not an alternative measure of revenue or revenue growth on a us gaap basis

recurring revenue  the best indicator of the overall strength of our business  grew in constant currency in in comparison to  including growth of due to the olympus acquisition 
strong growth in consumable sales in immunoassay  continued growth in other product areas including the continued build up of lease payments and the acquisition of cogenics in april contributed to the increase 
recurring revenue represented of our total revenue during in recurring revenue grew by or in constant currency compared to  due to growth of consumable sales  particularly in access immunoassay  and continued build up of lease payments 
year over year instrument sales revenue declined by or in constant currency during after growing by or in constant currency in the decline in was despite additional sales of million from olympus products 
we believe the overall decline in cash instrument sales is due to a number of factors  including the continued difficult economic environment  the tightening of the credit markets  constrained hospital and research operating environment and the strengthening dollar in the first half of the year 
as a result  sales were negatively impacted as customers remain cautious in their capital spending and in some cases have delayed purchases 
we expect instrument sales in to be slightly higher than as the outlook for the economy in general has improved 
clinical diagnostics clinical diagnostics revenue increased by in compared to  as a result of the acquisitions and organic growth in recurring revenue  offset by the decline in instrument sales 
in constant currency  clinical diagnostics realized an increase in revenue of for the year primarily driven by a improvement in recurring revenue 
the olympus acquisition accounted for million  or of growth in recurring revenue during continued robust growth in access immunoassay also contributed to the increase 
recurring revenue growth  excluding the effect of the olympus acquisition  largely reflects an expanding installed base  particularly in china  and increased test kit utilization 
the gains in recurring revenue  however  were partially offset by declines in instrument sales of in constant currency  in comparison to the prior year 
the decline in instrument sales was mainly due to cellular analysis products  which declined by more than during as compared to unusually strong instrument sales during  which benefited  in part  by increased sales as we recovered from a supply disruption 
during clinical diagnostics experienced double digit growth in all three product areas 
this was due primarily to strong instrument sales combined with growth in recurring revenue 
instrument sales increased or in constant currency for  while recurring revenue grew by or in constant currency 
the growth in instrument sales was due to added sales from our flow cytometry acquisition in december  elimination of our instrument backlog during the first half of the year  an increase in placements of chemistry and clinical automation systems  and our robust sales to emerging markets  where we continue to improve our penetration 
the growth in recurring revenue largely reflects the combined effect of expanding our installed base and increasing test kit utilization 
we also had higher than normal sales of bnp tests in as a distributor increased its inventory of bnp tests 
bec form k 
table of contents chemistry and clinical automation 
the olympus acquisition contributed revenue of million 
recurring revenue in constant currency from the existing business increased by in  however  cash instruments sales were down due to the constrained economic environment 
we achieved a fifth consecutive record year of integrated chemistry system placements  growing our installed base in mid to large sized hospitals and experience strong demand internationally as our customers focus on the efficiency and cost savings that can be provided by increased automation 
in  the increase in revenue was driven by continued success of the unicel dxc autochemistry instruments  leading to a fourth straight record year of unicel dxc instrument placements and growth in clinical automation of 
autochemistry grew by more than in comparison to due to accelerated work cell placements and double digit international growth 
cellular analysis 
revenue from cellular analysis decreased due primarily to a constant currency decline in cash instrument sales for the year due in large part to significantly lower placement of instruments in hematology 
we believe hematology sales were down due primarily to unusually high sales in and the effect of constrained capital spending due to the economic environment in cash instrument sales were unusually high during as we resolved a backlog related to a supply chain disruption 
in addition  the current constrained capital expenditure environment  including a stronger dollar in the first half of  has had a negative impact on our cash instrument sales 
instrument sales in flow cytometry declined as a result of constrained funding in the research market 
the decline in instrument sales  however  was partially offset by an increase in recurring revenue 
in revenue from cellular analysis increased due primarily to an increase in instrument sales of 
the increase was led by growth in flow cytometry products and the elimination of the instrument backlog in the first half of the year  as mentioned above 
our flow cytometry acquisition added basis points to the overall cellular group s growth rate 
immunoassay and molecular diagnostics 
revenue in immunoassay and molecular diagnostics increased due to an increase in sales of consumable products  primarily access immunoassay 
recurring revenue grew by and in constant currency for growth in placements of mid to ultra high volume immunoassay systems in the prior year helped increase our penetration at the account level and fueled recurring revenue growth 
additionally  the acquisition of cogenics in april and olympus in august contributed million and million to revenue during the year  respectively 
in  revenue in immunoassay and molecular diagnostics increased by when compared to the increase in recurring revenue was led by a growth from our access immunoassay products 
total access immunoassay sales  including instrument sales  grew worldwide in comparison to placements were up considerably  driven by strong growth of units in mid to high volume hospital laboratories 
life science revenue from our life science products decreased due to lower cash instrument sales  which declined by in constant currency for the year 
the decline was due to the current economic conditions in  which caused customers to delay capital spending 
we anticipate that research markets in will show a slight recovery  as government stimulus funding becomes more available to some customers 
revenue in increased due to growth in instrument sales of our centrifugation and life science automation products 
although we posted growth in this segment for  the growth moderated in the second half of the year as the dollar strengthened 
in the fourth quarter  life science sales were down more than or approximately in constant currency as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this decline was partly due to lower activity in international markets 
revenue by major geography overall  revenue in the us increased as a result of revenue from the olympus and cogenics acquisitions and from growth in recurring revenue  partially offset by declines of more than in cash instrument sales due to the factors mentioned earlier 
in revenue in the us was up due primarily to growth in clinical diagnostics of 
momentum in clinical diagnostics was broad based  with growth in access family immunoassay  auto chemistry and cellular analysis systems 
growth in these product lines was due primarily to increased instrument placements  our flow cytometry acquisition and elimination of the cellular instrument backlog in the first half of revenue in europe increased in due to an increase in recurring revenue of  primarily resulting from the olympus acquisition and from solid growth in immunoassay and molecular diagnostics 
the region  however  experienced a decline in cash instrument sales of or in constant currency 
we believe that the decline is due to adverse credit market and economic conditions which has led some customers to defer capital expenditures 
in revenue in europe rose by in constant currency with clinical diagnostics leading the way  up over or in constant currency 
within clinical diagnostics  cellular analysis and immunoassay and molecular diagnostics remained the greatest contributors to growth 
the increase in cellular analysis was due to added sales from our flow cytometry products which we acquired at the end of  while the increase in immunoassay and molecular diagnostics was due to increased recurring revenue from our access immunoassay products  generated from our expanding installed base 
automation and workcells are also becoming a key factor in expanding our growth in europe

restructuring and acquisition related costs restructuring and acquisition related costs increased by million during  when compared to the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to restructuring  integration and acquisition related costs associated with the olympus acquisition of million 
in addition  we incurred restructuring costs associated with the closure and relocation of certain manufacturing and distribution sites along with activities related to our plan to vacate our fullerton  california facility and consolidate those operations to other existing facilities 
the restructuring cost related to the closure and relocation of these sites includes severance  relocation  and other exit costs 
additionally  we analyzed the remaining useful life of certain assets  which in some cases resulted in a shorter life than our initial estimate 
based on this revised and shortened useful life  we accelerated depreciation expense  which resulted in million of higher depreciation during in we recorded charges of million related to severance  relocation  and other duplicative exit costs 
the charge includes a net gain of million related to the sale of buildings and land in hialeah  florida

environmental remediation during we began conducting soil and groundwater environmental studies at our fullerton  california site in connection with our orange county consolidation and planned closure of the fullerton site 
these studies indicate that the soil and groundwater at the fullerton site contain chemicals previously used in operations at the facility 
as a result  we recorded a million environmental remediation charge related to our fullerton facility 
the million represents our best estimate of future expenditures for evaluation and remediation at the site 
the ultimate costs may range from million to million

the adoption of this standard was applied retrospectively to the prior year financial results 
we recorded interest expense of million for  million for and million for as a result of implementing this accounting change 
interest expense increased by million during due primarily to additional interest expense of million resulting from our million issuance of debt to finance the olympus acquisition offset by lower interest expense on our income tax liabilities 
interest expense decreased in due primarily to a decrease in our tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions coupled with lower interest rates on our borrowings in comparison to the increase in other non operating income for was primarily related to foreign currency gains related to the olympus acquisition 
we recognized a million hedging gain during the year associated with forward contracts to purchase japanese yen 
since our purchase price for the olympus acquisition was paid in yen  we entered into forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the value of the yen which we settled as of july  we recorded a million foreign currency gain on the value of the yen for the period between settling the forward contract and the transfer of funds in yen to purchase olympus 
additionally  we recorded a million foreign currency gain related to the settlement of intercompany loans related to the olympus acquisition 
the increase in other non operating expense during was due primarily to the following transactions recorded during million gain  net of expenses  associated with the breakup fee received in connection with the termination of the merger agreement with biosite  incorporated biosite 
million gain on the sale of vacant land in miami million expense with respect to a contribution to establish the beckman coulter foundation excluding the effect of these transactions  other non operating expense increased over the prior year due primarily to currency related costs

the additional gain on sale of million million net of taxes  was recorded in discontinued operations during income tax income tax as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations was in  in and in discrete items which reduced tax expense for consisted primarily of settlement of tax audits  changes to various tax credits and recognition of a deferred tax asset for a foreign net operating loss 
our effective tax rate was lower than the united states federal statutory rate due primarily to geographic profit mix with more income earned outside the us in lower tax jurisdictions various tax credits  including r e tax credits deduction allowed for us tax purposes related to manufacturing activities in the us during  we filed certain tax accounting method changes with the us internal revenue service irs 
as a result of these accounting method changes  certain tax deductions were accelerated and reflected in the federal income tax return  resulting in a net operating loss for that year for tax purposes 
this loss has been carried back to the tax year and reduces taxes previously paid 
we received a total of million in additional tax refunds in resulting from accounting method changes 
the acceleration of these tax deductions reduces certain permanent tax benefits in tax years and the impact of the reduction of these permanent tax benefits  totaling million  was reflected as a discrete item in the tax provision for the year

table of contents income tax as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations in was impacted negatively by several items including the establishment of a joint intercompany research and development program in ireland  which is expected to negatively impact our tax rate over the next couple of years but yield a lower long term tax rate 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a reconciliation of the us statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be higher than due to a change in geographical profit mix with more income expected to be earned in higher tax jurisdictions such as the us our effective tax rate  however  may be impacted by a number of factors including  enactments of new tax laws  new interpretations of existing tax laws  rulings by and settlements with taxing authorities  our generation of tax credits  including r e tax credits and our geographic profit mix 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
some amounts held outside of the united states could be subject to united states federal income taxes if repatriated  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
repatriation could result in additional united states federal income tax payments in future years 
where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds  our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
liquidity includes our ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert assets that are no longer required in meeting existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
for purposes of achieving long range business objectives and meeting our commitments  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds 
our business model  in particular recurring revenue comprised of consumable supplies including reagent test kits  service  and otl payments  allows us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we continue to invest a substantial portion of this cash flow in instruments leased to customers 
we expect operating cash flows to increase as our revenue and depreciation from new otls increase year over year 
we anticipate our operating cash flows together with the funds available through our credit facilities will continue to satisfy our working capital requirements 
during the next twelve months  we anticipate using our operating cash flows or other sources of liquidity to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products 
we expect new product offerings to come from new technologies gained through licensing arrangements  existing r d projects  and business acquisitions  maintain or raise our quarterly dividend 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  although dividend payments are at the discretion of our board of directors  we expect to pay quarterly dividends in of per share  pay costs associated with our supply chain and restructuring initiatives  complete our orange county consolidation project  make pension and postretirement plan contributions of million  and repurchase shares we expect payments associated with the environmental clean up of our fullerton facility to become more significant in and beyond

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of all derivative foreign exchange contracts were million and million  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at the spot exchange rate at the respective dates 
the net fair values of all derivative foreign exchange contracts as of december  and  were a net asset of million and million  respectively 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain from a fair value change of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss from a fair value change of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to have no impact on our pre tax earnings based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenue in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
the dollar strengthened since the first half of  therefore the impact of the strengthening dollar will be more pronounced in the first half of than in the second half of  based upon current rates 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts and purchased option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions based on prior year rates 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the major currencies against which we hedge are the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound sterling and canadian dollar

table of contents we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk since our long term debt is nearly all fixed 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity
