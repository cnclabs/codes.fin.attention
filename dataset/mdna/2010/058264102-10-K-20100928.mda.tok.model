critical accounting policies and estimates baldwin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires baldwin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
baldwin continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
baldwin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s products are sold with terms and conditions that vary depending on the nature of the product sold and the cultural and business environments in which the company operates 
the company recognizes revenue based on the type of product sold and the obligations under the contract 
revenue is recognized on contracts for design  manufacture and delivery of equipment without installation equipment sales and parts  service and consumables at the time of transfer of title or rendering of services 
the company considers revenue realized on equipment sales when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in contracts that include additional services  including installation  start up and or commissioning system sales  the company recognizes revenue on each element of the contract as appropriate 
installation services are provided to the customer on an as needed basis and may be contracted for separately or included in the same contract as the equipment sale 
revenue is recognized for installation services at the completion of the contractually required services 
contracts for system sales may include multiple element revenue arrangements 
when the company enters into multiple element revenue arrangements  which may include installation services as a contractual element  along with the purchase price of the product as a contractual element  the arrangement is separated into its stand alone elements for revenue recognition purposes 
when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement does not include a general right of return  revenue is recognized on each element as separate units of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being deferred until the last undelivered contractual element is fulfilled 
standard payment terms may include a deposit to be received with the customer order  progress payments until equipment is shipped and a portion of the balance due within a set number of days following shipment 
in those cases when the company renders invoices prior to performance of the service  the company records deferred revenue until completion of the services  whereupon revenue is fully recognized 
freight terms are generally fob shipping dock with risk of loss passing to the purchaser at the time of shipment 
if a loss should occur in transit  the company is not responsible for and does not administer insurance claims unless the terms are fob destination or special terms and conditions of the sale require the company to administer such insurance claims 
the customer is not contractually eligible for any refund of the purchase price or right of return of the contracted product  unless the product fails to meet published product specifications and the company fails to perform its obligations under product warranty terms 
the terms of sale are generally recited in purchase orders  which may contain formal product acceptance clauses 
occasionally  clauses may be included in a contract or purchase order that require acceptance related to certain specifications as outlined in the contract or purchase order 
in these instances  the nature of the acceptance is evaluated to ensure that the company has met the applicable criteria concurrent with the shipment of equipment to the customer to ensure that revenue recognition is appropriate in the circumstances 
the company sometimes uses distributors to assist in the sales function 
in these cases  the company does not recognize revenue until title for the equipment and risk of loss have passed to the ultimate customer  who then becomes obligated to pay with no right of 
table of contents return 
in addition  the company reviews all alliance agreements to determine whether revenue should be recognized on a gross or net basis and recognizes revenue as appropriate 
baldwin maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of baldwin s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
baldwin provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while baldwin engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  baldwin s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from baldwin s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
baldwin provides reserves for estimated obsolescence in inventory or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
due to the continued deteriorating macro economic environment  a decision to transfer equipment manufacturing from the us to germany  general restructuring of the us operations and the inability of the us operation to reach target goals for inventory utilization  the company recorded a  additional reserve for obsolescence during the third quarter of fiscal year for its us inventories 
baldwin records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
baldwin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event baldwin were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should baldwin determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded through a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using statutory tax rates for temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as the effects of net operating losses carried forward in certain tax jurisdictions in which the company operates that may be utilized to offset future taxable income and similar tax credits carried forward that may be utilized to reduce future taxes payable 
the company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowances  certain judgments are made by management relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets  use of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
the assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically by management based on overall economic conditions and current business conditions that affect the company 
these management judgments are therefore subject to change based on factors that include  but are not limited to changes in the profitability of the company s subsidiaries as well as for the company as a whole  the ability of the company to successfully execute its tax planning strategies  and the accuracy of the company s estimate of the potential effect that changes in tax legislation in the jurisdictions where the company operates may have on the company s future taxable profits 
failure by the company to achieve forecasted taxable income or to execute its tax planning strategies may affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income or successfully execute its tax planning strategies include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share  delays in product availability and changes in tax legislation 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in may of each fiscal year 
the company has identified seven reporting units in accordance with asc as the lowest level of an entity that is a business  that can be distinguished from other activities  operations  and assets of the entity and for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined utilizing an equal weighting of a combination of income and market approaches of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with its recorded book value 
the income approach applies a discounted cash flow methodology to the company s future period projections  and a market approach compares the company s multiples of revenues and earnings with those of comparable companies 
the company considers the combination of valuation techniques  which utilizes internal analysis and external valuations and utilizes both income and market approach to determine fair value  provides a better estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit as opposed to reliance on one valuation technique 
significant estimates and assumptions are inherent in the valuations that reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants  the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability and the discount rate applied to cash flows 
unanticipated market or macroeconomic events or circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions used 
table of contents in the determination of fair value 
a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect financial statements in any given year 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would be compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
asc requires management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
at june  the annual impairment test for goodwill indicated that all reporting unit fair values exceeded their respective recorded values 
however  the estimated fair value of the german reporting unit which exceeded carrying value by approximately has been disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn 
the current valuation has the reporting unit returning to sales and earnings more consistent with long term business plans  failure to achieve the plans  further or continued deterioration of macro economic conditions could result in a valuation that could trigger impairment of goodwill 
the amount of goodwill at the german reporting unit is approximately million 
during fiscal year ended june  as a result of the deteriorating macro economic environment  the continued market volatility and the company s decreased market capitalization  the company assessed the recoverability of its goodwill carrying value as required 
a two step process was used to test goodwill impairment 
the first step was to determine if there was an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
upon indication of impairment  a second step would be performed to determine the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
as a result of the assessment  and the impact of the deteriorating economic and market conditions that led to a reduced demand for the company s products supplied by its japan reporting unit  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  related to its japan reporting unit during the third quarter of fiscal year other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset and a change in business climate 
baldwin calculates estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compares it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require the company to record an impairment charge in the future 
the impairment review process requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the respective assets 
the key variables that management must estimate in determining these expected future cash flows include sales volumes  sales prices  sales growth  production and operating costs  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  market conditions and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and such estimates are inherently uncertain  however  the assumptions used are reasonable and consistent with the company s internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on conditions that influence these variables 
the assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets reflect management s best assumptions and estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties as described above  many of which are not under management s control 
as a result  the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods 
pension obligations and the related benefits costs are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality  discount rates  long term return on assets  salary increases  and other factors 
changes in these assumptions can result in changes to the recognized pension expense and recorded liabilities 
for stock based compensation  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options issued as compensation to key employees and non employee directors 
the model determines a fair value based on a number of key variables including the grant date price of the company s common stock and the related exercise or strike price  estimated dividend yield  estimated term of the option prior to exercise  risk free rate of interest over the estimated term and a measure of the 
table of contents volatility of the company s common stock over the estimated term 
certain of these variables encompass a degree of subjectivity whose variability could result in significantly different values for the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
in addition  the company recognizes share based compensation cost based upon the number of awards that are expected to vest 
this method implicitly includes an estimate for forfeitures based on employee turnover  reductions in force and other factors specific to the award recipient population 
the company has a policy to review its estimate of award forfeitures on an annual basis or when specific facts and circumstances warrant additional review
