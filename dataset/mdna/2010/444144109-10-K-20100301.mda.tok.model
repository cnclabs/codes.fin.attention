inflation inflation has not historically had a material impact on the company s operations 
reliance on suppliers and customers the company s financial performance and its ability to sell refrigerants is in part dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of virgin  non cfc based refrigerants  and of reclaimable cfc and non cfc based  refrigerants from manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  bulk gas brokers and from other sources within the air conditioning  refrigeration and automotive aftermarket industries  and on corresponding demand for refrigerants 
the company s refrigerant sales include cfc based refrigerants  which are no longer manufactured 
additionally  the company s refrigerant sales include non cfc based refrigerants  including hcfc and hfc refrigerants  which are the most widely used refrigerants

in addition  effective january  the act further limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants and additional federal regulations were enacted which imposed further limitations on the use  production and importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants 
under the act  production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by the year and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by the year the limitations imposed by and under the act may limit supplies of virgin refrigerants for the foreseeable future or cause a significant increase in the price of virgin hcfc refrigerants 
to the extent the company is unable to source sufficient quantities of virgin or reclaimable refrigerants in the future  or resell refrigerants at a profit  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
for the years ended december  and  no one customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues 
the loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of and or a reduction in purchases of the company s products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
seasonality and weather conditions and fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results vary from period to period as a result of weather conditions  requirements of potential customers  non recurring refrigerant and service sales  availability and price of refrigerant products virgin or reclaimable  changes in reclamation technology and regulations  timing in introduction and or retrofit or replacement of cfc and non cfc based refrigeration equipment  the rate of expansion of the company s operations  and by other factors 
the company s business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first half of each year 
during past years  the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
in addition  during  the company experienced decreases in page sales due  in part  to unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months  which adversely impacted demand for refrigerants 
delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods  lack of refrigerant demand  increased expenses  declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and significant losses 
the company believes that there is a similar seasonal element to refrigerantside service revenues as refrigerant sales 
the company is continuing to assess its refrigerantside service revenues seasonal trend
