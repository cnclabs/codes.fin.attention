item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction telular develops products and services that utilize wireless networks to provide data and voice connectivity among people and machines 
telular s product and service offerings are created through telular s historical competence in developing cellular electronics along with utilizing the data transport capabilities of today s commercial wireless networks 
telular generates a majority of its revenue through the delivery of machine to machine mm and event monitoring services  such as its telguard and tanklink services 
a portion of its revenue comes from the sale of specialty cellular hardware products designed by telular for use exclusively with its mm services 
although telular has a wide base of customers in the western hemisphere  much of its revenue is generated from a small number of major customers 
telular s operating expense levels are based in large part on its expectations for its future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and telular s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in item a  risk factors 
the market for telular s products is primarily in north and south america and consists of a number of vertical applications including telguard security alarm conveyance  tanklink storage tank monitoring  and  general purpose wireless terminals for voice calls and internet access 
these markets are addressed primarily through indirect channels consisting of third party value added resellers vars  distributors  representatives and agents along with in house sales and customer support teams 
a direct sales model is utilized for certain large customers 
during june  telular abandoned its fixed cellular phone fcp segment after unsuccessfully marketing this unit for sale 
many of the segment s assets were parts and finished goods inventory which were sold prior to abandonment of the segment on june  telular believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  including the creation of event monitoring services that can be sold with products 
research and development activities sponsored by telular for the years ended september   and were   and  respectively 
the following details areas of product delivery and research during fiscal and anticipated in fiscal telguard telular s engineering team continues to update the telguard product and service offering by designing new features that are realized through a combination of hardware and software development activities 
in fiscal  telular redesigned its best selling telguard hardware models in order to reduce the cost of production and to enhance the functionality of these products 
in addition  telular introduced the new tg express product in april and it is now a top selling product in the telguard portfolio 
telular also launched the telguard advantage program on july  a frequent buyer program which encourages greater use of telular s services 
looking forward to  telular has a number of new features and hardware products under development that will be released 
these include a sole path fire communicator and telguard interactive a software based capability which allows end users to control their security panel remotely using a smartphone application 
tanklink the fiscal acquisition of tanklink brought telular a successful wireless communicator product line for tank level monitoring 
additional enhancements to this hardware and its supporting message center have been made during telular plans to continue its enhancement activities for this service line during fiscal to improve its competitive position and to add additional features to the service offering in response to customer demand 
other mm solutions during  telular focused on its existing lines of business but telular expects in to evaluate a number of vertical and sub vertical mm markets to determine the viability of creating or acquiring a product and or service for these markets 
fabrication of telular s products is accomplished through contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers in china and the united states make and test all hardware products 
there are several firms that compete with telular s telguard products and services 
these primary competitors include honeywell  dsc  numerex and alarm 
com 
telular believes it has a market share for cellular alarm communicators  having introduced the first such device for digital cellular networks in march demand for cellular communicators has once again increased markedly over the past year 
we believe this is due to consumers eliminating traditional telephone lines and therefore  requiring a cellular communicator to enable a home security system 
if this trend continues  telular believes that telular and its competitors will continue to see substantial demand for products and related services 
with regard to the other terminal products sold by telular  there are a large number of competitors that manufacture and sell fcts 
they include ericsson  axesstel  yx and numerous other manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
much of the demand for these terminals is outside the united states and demand is concentrated among the large wireless carriers that operate in various countries around the world 
competition is based on reputation  features and pricing 
telular s products have historically sold well in latin america and telular is able to realize an acceptable selling price due to telular s reputation for quality products in that region 
the fct business is not a focus of telular but it continues to earn an acceptable contribution margin and will b e maintained for as long as it continues to do so 
telular has granted a license for its patents to ericsson radio systems ab and currently faces competition for fct sales from ericsson 
with respect to its interface technology  telular currently has issued and active patents and issued foreign patents 
telular has successfully defended some of its patents in court 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
telular expects to expend most of its market and product development resources on the mm space  including continuing to capitalize on its favorable market position in the domestic security alarm market by virtue of its well regarded telguard offering  as well as continuing to improve overall penetration in the tank level monitoring market through tanklink 
due to uncertainties in international markets and pending new product introductions  telular is unable to forecast results and resource allocations for fct products 
unit sales during fiscal  telular sold approximately  telguard units  compared with approximately  telguard units for fiscal we sold approximately  tank monitoring units in fiscal  as compared to sales of  tank monitoring units in fiscal our telguard subscriber base grew in fiscal to approximately  up from approximately  subscribers in fiscal the telguard churn rate for the trailing month period was approximately and when normalized for out of period deactivations was approximately  well below the security industry average 
we expect telguard sales of between  and  units on a quarterly basis throughout fiscal revenue trends while product sales have fluctuated due to economic conditions at times  service revenues have grown consistently 
service revenue increased to of sales in the fourth quarter as we successfully added new subscribers at a high rate and kept our churn rate low 
telguard service average revenue per unit  or arpu  was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal tanklink service arpu was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in arpu is a result of pricing variances in the level of services purchased 
recent developments fiscal was a highly productive year for telguard product and marketing enhancements 
in the spring  telular launched the tg express  which became telular s second most popular cellular communicator 
during the summer  telular launched the telguard advantage program  a frequent buyer program for telular dealers 
in october  telular announced the ability for telguard fire units to be the sole communications path for commercial fire alarm applications 
we believe that our customers are very excited for the release of the product  which is expected to take place in the first quarter of fiscal  since this technology will allow our customers to eliminate phone lines and save money now that telular units can totally replace landlines in fire alarm situations 
in november  telular announced telguard interactive services  which allows an end user to remotely check the status and activate or deactivate their home alarm system via a smart phone 
in connection with these services  telular has created an iphone application that can be downloaded onto iphones 
in early calendar we have several planned additional new telguard products and features planned 
in our tanklink line of business we have successfully streamlined the business  improved its production and customer service processes and returned to a path of growth 
the fourth quarter of fiscal was the first full quarter in which tanklink generated positive operating cash flow 
telular continues to be excited about opportunities for tanklink with our partner in latin america  telef nica  as well as other initiatives in the tanklink line of business 
on november   telular announced the declaration of two dividends 
a special one time payment of per share along with a regular quarterly dividend of per share was paid on november  to shareholders of record at the closing of business on november results of operations in thousands  except share data fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales monitoring equipment terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues product revenues decreased primarily due to decreased sales in both telguard monitoring equipment and terminal products 
revenues from sales of our telguard monitoring equipment experienced lower demand as a result of a change in pricing terms within agreements between adt  our largest security dealer customer and its network of authorized dealers 
the dealer implemented a monthly service charge to the end user for any system sold by an authorized dealer that included a telguard product 
due to this surcharge  the authorized dealers generally opted to choose other security products over telguard products which resulted in decreased sales volume  approximately  telguard units were sold in fiscal compared with approximately  for fiscal telular expects this tre nd to continue and has implemented targeted pricing discount programs to maintain sales volumes 
the decrease in terminal product revenues reflects continued depressed demand in both the us and in the central american latin american cala regions 
of the  of total terminal sales in fiscal  only were from international sales compared to  of total terminal sales in fiscal  of which were from international sales 
telular has chosen to focus its sales efforts in the monitoring equipment and services market 
service revenues increased primarily due to increased activations in fiscal for each hardware unit sold  service revenue is generated when the unit is activated 
the average revenue per unit arpu increased slightly to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as of september  the subscriber base is approximately  an increase of approximately  subscribers from approximately  subscribers as of september  cost of sales the decrease in product cost of sales of reflects lower sales offset by reduced production costs primarily from re engineering of component parts 
service cost of sales increased over last year reflecting the increase of subscribers during the year offset by reduced internal cost of billing the service 
product margins  as a percentage of product revenues  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is a result of pricing discount programs  such as the telguard advantage program  offered during the year targeted to encourage increased sales volumes 
telular expects to continue these pricing discount programs 
service margins  as a percentage of service revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a reduction in fulfillment costs 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development engineering and development expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of in consulting fees as a result of reduced utilization of contract engineers  and  in various office expenses and engineering testing expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
offsetting these reductions was increase in salary related expenses resulting from adding additional headcount in concert with the reduction of the utilization of contract engineers 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decrease by primarily due to decrease payroll related expenses as a result of decreased sales and marketing personnel and expenses such as commissions that fluctuate with sales volume  decrease in travel expenses related to reduced travel abroad  decrease in third party commission expenses related to decreased sales volume  and decrease in various office and general expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately related to marketing efforts such as trade shows and brochures 
general and administrative g a g a expenses increased by primarily due to the following increases in legal expenses related primarily to increased efforts by outside counsel in defending telular in a patent lawsuit  in director non cash compensation as a result of valuing and recording the expense of the option component of restricted stock units  in business license fees and non income taxes as a result of increased presence in certain states  in bank and credit card fees as a result of increased usage by customers of credit cards to pay for products and services  and  in payroll related expenses primarily due to increase in non cash compensation related to stock options 
offsetting these increases were decreases to the following expenses in additional proxy costs related to a proxy contest in fiscal in fiscal there we no such additional costs in facility related costs such as phone  utilities and general maintenance  and in travel and general office expenses as a result of telular s overall initiative to reduce costs 
other income other income increased by primarily due to increase in interest income  year over year  and decrease in various miscellaneous expenses 
income taxes telular recorded a current income tax provision of and a deferred income tax benefit of  for fiscal year as compared with a current provision of and no deferred tax provision for fiscal year the increase in the current provision was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in fiscal year the increase in the deferred tax benefit was due to the reversal of the valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets 
in the prior year  telular s net deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance against them 
net income telular recorded net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal year compared to net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the income tax benefit recorded from reversal of net deferred tax assets valuation allowances 
in fiscal  telular s net deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance against them 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales monitoring equipment terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues product revenues decreased primarily due to decreased sales of both telguard monitoring equipment and terminal products as a result of lower customer demand 
demand for our telguard products during fiscal was heightened by an fcc mandated transition from analog to digital cellular service in the first and second quarters of fiscal sales of our terminals products were primarily lower in the central american latin american cala region due to depressed economies resulting in decreased purchases 
services revenues increased  primarily due to continued increase of subscribers including tank subscribers not included in fiscal results 
as of september   the subscriber base was approximately  an increase of approximately  subscribers from approximately  subscribers as of september  cost of sales the decrease in total cost of sales of reflects both lower sales volume and product mix 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for the last year 
product margins  as a percentage of product revenues  decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was a result of reduced product pricing due to competitive pressures 
service margins  as a percentage of service revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a reduction in fulfillment costs that were partially offset by a slight increase in carrier surcharge costs 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development engineering and development expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of in professional fees primarily due to placement fees incurred in fiscal to replace voluntary employee terminations as a result of the move of the engineering and development function to atlanta from new york  in engineering materials and supplies  as a result of efforts to hold costs down  in travel expenses which reflects the move of the engineering and development function to atlanta from new york in these expense reductions were offset by a increase in facility and office expenses related to the acquisition of tanklink 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses for fiscal years and have been adjusted to reflect a reclass of and  respectively  from general and administrative expenses to be consistent with the current year presentation 
these expenses relate to a department whose focus and activities have changed and are more properly associated with the sales function 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of expenses specifically related to decreased levels of product sales of third party commission expenses  of co op marketing expenses  and  of internal commissions 
in consulting fees as a result of hiring additional permanent marketing and sales staff  reducing the use of consultants 
offsetting these expense reductions was a increase in payroll related expenses as a result of the addition of sales and marketing staff and the addition of staff from the acquisition of tanklink as well as a increase in travel expenses 
general and administrative g a g a costs for fiscal years and have been adjusted to reflect a reclass of and  respectively  to selling and marketing as noted above 
g a expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of in professional fees related to decreased legal fees as a result of reduced costs from outside counsel  decreased accounting fees resulting from factors impacting the cost of our external audit and decreased consulting fees as a result of not renewing strategic projects undertaken in fiscal  in payroll related fees such as reduced bonuses and non cash compensation related to issued stock options and stock option modifications  of expenses as a result of the reduction of amortization expense related to a prepaid loan fee and reduced commercial insurance  of travel expenses as a result of efforts to control costs  of facility  office and general expenses 
offsetting these reductions is an increase of for intangible amortization related to the acquisition of tanklink and of additional proxy costs related to the proxy contest in fiscal other income other income decreased by primarily from a reduction of interest income as a result of reduced rates and a reduced investment balance  and a increase of in various miscellaneous expenses income taxes telular recorded an income tax provision of for fiscal related to alternative minimum taxes 
there was no income tax provision for discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations of was due primarily to the return of phones previously sold to a customer in prior periods and the resale of those phones at a loss 
telular decided to take back the product in lieu of further attempts to collect on the outstanding account receivable from the prior period sale 
the resulting account receivable from the resale was fully collected as of september  net income telular recorded net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  of 
per fully diluted share for fiscal this increase was primarily due to reduced product costs and reduced operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources management regularly reviews telular s working capital and available borrowings in addition to its cash and cash equivalent balance to determine if it has enough cash to operate the business 
on september   telular had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and net working capital of  a year earlier 
telular can draw upon a loan and security agreement the agreement with silicon valley bank svb that provides an aggregate working capital line of credit up to  the agreement expires on december  management is in the process of negotiating a new loan agreement with svb and expects to have one in place by december  as of september   there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement 
management expects trade accounts receivable and inventory to turn into cash in short periods of time 
as such  given the level of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable and inventory  management believes telular has adequate resources to fund current and planned operations in a manner consistent with historical practices 
the tables below discuss the liquidity components of continuing operations for fiscal years and telular corp table for liquidity section of md a fiscal the company generated cash of  from continuing operations during fiscal compared to cash generated of  during the same period of fiscal the components of the change for fiscal are as follows income from continuing operations  cash provided 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable is due to the timely collection of outstanding balances  resulting from a more favorable product mix 
service revenue represents of telular s total revenues for the twelve month period ending september  the accounts receivable associated with this revenue stream are generally collected within days of invoicing 
the timely collections along with reduced product billings resulted in the decrease 
the decrease in inventory reflects the company s overall inventory strategy  sell from existing stock while reducing production levels to augment the reduction in sales levels 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular s contract manufacturers and monitoring service providers 
the increase was primarily due to the timing of receipt of invoices from these vendors 
in the prior year payment was made before year end  in fiscal  payments to these vendors were made subsequent to year end 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to increase in legal fees related to a patent infringement lawsuit  a increase in royalties due which are paid twice a year and approximately in decreases to various miscellaneous accrued expenses 
non cash expenses benefits  from the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance   from stock based compensation expense  of depreciation expense  of amortization expense  and  from the loss on on disposal of operating assets 
net cash used by other working capital items  primarily the acquisition of intangibles  patents  trademarks  a licensing fee and the increase in income taxes payable

the decrease in inventory reflects the company s overall inventory strategy  sell from existing stock while reducing production levels to augment the reduction in sales levels 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular s contract manufacturers 
the decrease reflects decreased purchases from our contract manufactures  primarily due to reduced sales volume 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to payments for bonuses  royalties and co op advertising and the reduction in liability balances related to reduced sales volumes such as agent commissions  professional fees and certain operating expenses 
non cash expenses  from stock based compensation  depreciation expense  amortization expense 
net cash provided by other working capital items 
total cash provided by continuing operations capital expenditures for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the expenditures were for improvements to the message center  test equipment for operations  product certification and leasehold improvements for the atlanta office 
the expenditures were primarily for purchase of a new erp system  additional equipment for operations and for new computers  replacing obsolete equipment 
telular anticipates funding future capital additions with cash from operations 
on july   telular s board approved a plan to repurchase up to  of telular s common stock on the open market 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased under the plan at a cost of during fiscal   shares were repurchased at a cost of  in addition to the plan  on june   a modified dutch auction tender offer was completed buying back  shares of common stock at a cost of  telular generally requires its foreign customers to prepay  obtain letters of credit or qualify for credit 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on telular s results of operations  telular conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars 
the following table sets forth our total contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  consisting primarily of raw materials and finished goods inventory 
telular expects to satisfy these commitments primarily from cash from the revenues generated by the delivery of backlogged orders 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses telular s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the net realizable value of inventories and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the presentation of telular s financial condition and results of o perations 
allowance for doubtful accounts telular maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payment for products and services 
telular evaluates the collectability of customer receivables by considering the payment history and the financial stability of its customers 
if telular believes that an account receivable may not be collected  a charge is recorded to the allowance account 
at september  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trades accounts receivable from continuing operations was and  respectively 
reserve for obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
telular generally considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply  based on current year activity  to be excess  unless that inventory has alternative uses 
telular also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were and  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
reserve for warranty telular maintains a reserve for products that are returned within telular s warranty period due to inoperability 
telular has different warranty periods for its different product groups the security monitoring products has a month warranty period  the tank monitoring products have a month warranty period  and  the terminal products have a month warranty period 
significant management judgment is required to determine the warranty reserve 
telular utilizes historical information regarding units returned within the appropriate warranty period and the costs incurred to repair returned units 
telular then estimates required warranty reserves for future products that may be returned 
as of september  and  the warranty reserve was and  respectively 
goodwill telular evaluates the fair value and recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in determining fair value and recoverability  telular makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for net revenues  cost of sales and operating expenses for the monitoring and terminal businesses  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries  and  estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  telular must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating the ability to recover its deferred tax assets  telular considers all available positive and negative evidence including its past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and its forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  telular developed assumptions including the amount of future federal and state pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates telular is using to manage the underlying business 
telular has recorded significant valuation allowances that are intended to be maintained until it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the current valuation allowance of  is primarily for estimated federal and state net operating losses that will expire before they can be realized 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction 
any reduction in future taxable income may require that telular record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
based on internal revenue code section section  changes in the ownership of telular may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
any section limitation may req uire that telular record an additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on telular s future earnings 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results from operations  financial position or cash flows 
under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc  income taxes  telular would recognize liabilities for tax issues in the u 
s based on telular s estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these tax liabilities would be recorded in income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of september   telular has no uncertain tax positions recorded in its financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference from item  notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk telular frequently invests available cash and cash equivalents in short term instruments such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
although the rate of interest paid on such investments may fluctuate over time  each of telular s investments is made at a fixed interest rate over the duration of the investment 
all of these investments have maturities of less than days 
telular believes its exposure to market risk fluctuations for these investments is not material as of september  financial instruments that potentially subject telular to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable 
to reduce its exposure to the credit risks of international customers  telular generally seeks payment prior to shipment or receives irrevocable letters of credit that are confirmed by us banks 
in some instances  telular extends credit to foreign customers without the protection of prepayment or letters of credit telular performs ongoing credit evaluations and charges amounts to operations when they are determined to be uncollectible 
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on telular s results of operations  telular conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars
