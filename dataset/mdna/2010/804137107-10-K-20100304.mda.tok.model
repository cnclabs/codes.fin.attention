agriculture sales increased in the americas due to strong commodity prices  however they started to show signs of weakening late in increased sales into the americas agriculture market were offset by decreased sales into the turf care market  primarily driven by the decline in housing starts and concerns regarding the slowing economic conditions 
construction road building sales into the construction road building markets decreased percent during  with the majority of the decrease occurring in the fourth quarter 
the decrease is driven by an percent decrease in the european market and a percent decrease in the americas market  both due to weakening economic conditions  reduced housing starts  and customers focus on reducing inventory levels

these charges were incurred as a result of lower profitability in the motors and steering reporting units than the company had previously expected and lower future expectations in certain end markets 
the work function segment incurred property  plant and equipment impairment charges of million as a result of lower expected cash flow related to the products produced within the motors asset group 
segment income was also negatively impacted by severance costs of million as a result of recent actions taken in response to the slowing economy 
controls segment sales in the controls segment decreased percent for the year ended december   excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  compared to segment income declined million 
this decrease is due to several factors  including an million increase in field recall costs and a million increase in fixed overhead costs due to increases in production capacity

market risk the company is naturally exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency changes the company has operations and sells its products in many different countries of the world and therefore  conducts its business in various currencies 
the company s financial statements  which are presented in us dollars  can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
translation risk is the risk that the financial statements of the company  for a particular period or as of a certain date  may be affected by changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate the financial statements of the company s operations from foreign currencies into us dollars 
transaction risk is the risk from the company receiving its sale proceeds or holding its assets in a currency different from that in which it pays its expenses and holds its liabilities 
in previous years  the company had been well balanced between its us and european operations because the company generated its sales in the same region in which it incurred its expenses  or shipped products between geographic regions on a balanced basis 
however  in recent years the balance has shifted and the amount of sales made in us dollars has increased  whereas the production costs are in a currency other than the us dollar  increasing the company s exposure to transaction risk 
in the company sold a total of million of product into the us that had been produced in european based currencies compared to sales into europe of million of product produced in us dollars 
this imbalance had a significant impact on the results of the company 
in the results were favorable as the dollar strengthened in comparison to other currencies 
the company produces and sells its product in several regions of the world  however the us and european transactions comprise the majority of the imbalance between regions 
the company enters into forward contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on cash flows related to forecasted sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling location 
the forecasted sales represent sales to both external and internal parties 
any effects of the forward contracts related to sales to internal parties are eliminated in the consolidation process until the related inventory has been sold to an external party 
the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting and therefore are subject to effectiveness testing at the inception of the contract and throughout the life of the contract 
in  as a result of hedge accounting for the forward contracts  the company recognized a decrease to net sales of million and other income of million 
the fair value of forward contracts included on the balance sheet at december  was a net asset of million 
the company is also impacted by translation risk in terms of comparing results from period to period 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore  significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
translation affects the comparability of both the income statement and the balance sheet 
as shown in the table below  the translation impact on net sales was not significant in this is because the us dollar strengthened against the euro during the first half of the year  while it weakened during the second half of the year 
percentage sales growth over prior year as reported without currency translation impact the change in the exchange rate does affect the comparability of the balance sheet between and as the balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate as of december the us dollar weakened percent against the euro and percent against the danish kroner from december  to december  the weakening of the dollar has resulted in approximately percent of the company s total balance sheet being stated approximately percent higher than the prior year 
interest rate changes the company has used interest rate swap agreements on a limited basis to manage the interest rate risk on its total debt portfolio 
during march the company settled both of its interest rate swap agreements due to repayment of the underlying debt agreements  resulting in a loss of million recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of loss on early retirement of debt 
the following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations for fixed and variable rate debt amounts in millions fixed rate debt variable rate debt and thereafter total liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and from its various credit facilities 
the company historically has accessed diverse funding sources  including short term and long term unsecured bank lines of credit in the us  europe  and asia pacific  as well as the private debt markets in the us as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company determined  following the close of its fiscal year  that it would likely be unable to continue to meet the leverage ratio covenants in its various credit agreements as of the end of the first quarter of to avoid a default under the credit agreements  the company entered into a credit agreement with danfoss a s on march   pursuant to which the company had the ability to borrow up to million original credit agreement 
the agreement had no financial covenants and was set to mature on september  danfoss a s is the company s majority stockholder 
during the third quarter of  the company determined that it would require additional liquidity of between million and million over the course of to meet its projected cash commitments 
this additional cash requirement was driven by the company s greatly reduced operating cash flows in  the continued weakness in the global economy  and an anticipated increase in sales with the accompanying need to fund production activities and customer accounts receivable 
on november   the company entered into a new credit agreement danfoss agreement with danfoss a s 
the agreement was approved by the company s board of directors on november  upon the recommendation of a special committee of the board comprised exclusively of independent directors 
pursuant to the danfoss agreement  the original credit agreement and a million term loan from danfoss a s were terminated and replaced by a new unsecured credit facility permitting the company to borrow up to million from danfoss a s 
the company s borrowings under the agreement will be due and payable in full on april  the danfoss agreement contains no financial covenants but it does contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  require the company to obtain the consent of danfoss a s prior to engaging in certain types of transactions 
the principal amount outstanding under the danfoss agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the us prime rate or libor  as in effect at times specified in the agreement  plus percent 
the company was required to pay a closing fee of million to danfoss a s 
the agreement also requires the company to pay a quarterly fee equal to percent of the average daily unused portion of the million credit facility 
the agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding the company and its business and operations 
it also sets forth a number of events of default for  among other things  failure to pay principal and interest  breaches of representations  warranties and covenants and various events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the company or its subsidiaries 
the company expects to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its funding needs for the foreseeable future  recognizing that prior to april  the company will need to either extend its current credit agreement with danfoss a s or obtain an alternative source of funding from either danfoss a s or a third party 
however  unexpected events or circumstances  such as further reduced operating cash flows or prolonged or increased weakness in the global economy  could negatively impact the company s liquidity to an extent that may require the company to seek new or additional sources of cash prior to april  cash flows from operations cash provided by operations was million in cash increased as a result of a million decrease in accounts receivable  excluding the effects of currency  due primarily to reduced sales levels in  as well as a million decrease in inventories  excluding currency  due to lower production volume and inventory reduction efforts 
these changes were offset by a million decrease in accounts payable at the end of compared with the end of  as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
total cash of the company increased million from december  to december  largely due to the fact that borrowings from danfoss require a day notice  which makes it necessary for the company to maintain a cash surplus to fund day to day operations 
at december  cash balances in china totaled million  an increase of million from december  the company is paying dividends from its chinese entities to the maximum extent possible under current regulations  however  due to the nature of the governmental and other regulatory controls  it is difficult to transfer cash out of china for reasons other than payment for goods shipped into that country 
as the company continues to consider expanding its manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions  it will make every effort to utilize the cash balances in those regions to fund future expansions 
total cash outside of china increased by million in cash used in investing activities capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million in the decrease in is the result of lower capacity needs as sales were reduced due to the global economic downturn and management s increased focus on conserving cash 
cash used in financing activities the company paid dividends of million in the first quarter of  which were declared in fourth quarter in the company paid dividends of million 
net borrowings provided approximately million of cash during compared to million in during the company paid million in debt origination fees related to the original credit agreement and the danfoss agreement  and million in debt extinguishment and interest rate swap settlement costs 
in addition  the company makes varying distributions to its noncontrolling interest partners from its various joint venture activities depending on the amount of undistributed earnings of the business and the needs of the partners 
distributions totaled approximately million in compared to million in contractual cash obligations the majority of the company s contractual obligations to make cash payments to third parties are for financing obligations 
these include future lease payments under both operating and capital leases 
the following table discloses the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total and thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases rental and service agreements with related person danfoss a s total contractual cash obligations the following assumptions are used in the calculation of the contractual cash obligations commitments denominated in a currency other than the us dollar are translated at the december  exchange rate 
the annual amount borrowed under revolving credit agreements does not change from the million borrowed at december   through the maturity date of the agreements 
the margin rate on variable interest rate debt does not change from december  the base interest rate for future years is based on the interest yield curves as of december  in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company has certain other funding needs that are non contractual by nature  including funding of certain pension plans 
in the company anticipates contributing million to its pension and health benefit plans 
other matters critical accounting estimates the sec s guidance surrounding the disclosure of critical accounting estimates requires disclosures about estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies 
however  such discussion is limited to critical accounting estimates  or those that management believes meet two criteria the accounting estimate must require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
besides the estimates that meet the two criteria for a critical estimate above  the company makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on experience and information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the sec s guidance 
the discussion below should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  uncertainties  contingencies  and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion  have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventory valuation as a manufacturer in the capital goods industry  inventory is a substantial portion of the assets of the company  amounting to over percent of total assets at december  the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes recording period adjustments as needed to record expenses due to excess capacity  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management within each segment performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify the need for appropriate write downs to cover each of these items 
in doing so  management applies consistent practices based upon historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  actual margins generated from trade sales of its products  and finally its best judgment to estimate the appropriate carrying value of the inventory 
warranty provisions the company warrants its various products over differing periods depending upon the type of product and application 
consequently  the company records liabilities for the estimated warranty costs that may be incurred under its basic warranty based on past trends of actual warranty claims compared to the actual sales levels to which those claims apply 
these liabilities are accrued at the time the sales of the products are recorded 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of units in the field currently under warranty  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units and the cost per claim to satisfy the company s warranty obligation 
the anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary factor impacting the company s estimated warranty obligation 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
in addition to its normal warranty liability  the company  from time to time in the normal course of business  incurs costs to repair or replace defective products with a specific customer or group of customers 
the company refers to these as field recalls and in these instances  the company will record a specific provision for the expected costs it will incur to repair or replace these products utilizing information from customers and internal information regarding the specific cost of materials and labor 
typically  field recalls are infrequent in occurrence  however  when they occur  field recalls can be for a large number of units and quite costly to rectify 
because of the sporadic and infrequent nature of field recalls  and due to the range of costs associated with field recalls  the company cannot accurately estimate these costs at the time the products are sold 
therefore  these costs are recorded at the time information becomes known to the company 
as the field recalls are settled  the company relieves the specific liability related to that field recall 
these specific field recall liabilities are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and long lived asset recovery a significant portion of the company s total assets consist of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill 
changes in technology or in the company s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in the broad global economy in which the company operates  may cause the estimated period of use or the carrying value of these assets to change 
this requires the company to periodically assess the estimated useful lives of its assets in order to match  through depreciation and amortization  the cost of those assets with the benefits derived over the period of usefulness 
the useful lives of these assets can be shortened through greater use due to volume increases  a change in strategy regarding production of a certain product  rapidly changing technology such as the use of electronics and computer operated controls  and through inadequate maintenance 
despite management s best efforts to determine the appropriate useful lives of its equipment  certain situations may arise that lead to an asset or group of assets becoming impaired  meaning their economic value becomes less than the value at which the company is carrying the asset on its books 
examples of these situations are product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities 
when these situations arise  the company tests the assets for impairment and will write down the asset in the period when the impairment becomes known 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
goodwill is also tested if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value triggering event 
the company completes its annual goodwill impairment valuation on december each year 
in the first quarter of the market value of the company had decreased and therefore was considered a triggering event which required goodwill to be tested for impairment 
the company has identified seven reporting units that are either operating segments or one level below operating segments 
in performing the impairment valuation  the company considers declines in market values  and reconciles the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the company s market value based on its stock price  plus a reasonable control premium  which is estimated as that amount which would be received to sell the company as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants 
when testing for goodwill impairment  the company performs a first step of the goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment 
in doing so  the company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill may be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the company determined that the fair value of goodwill for the propel and mobile electronics reporting units was greater than their carrying values at both march  and december  however  the fair value of goodwill for the valves reporting unit was less than its carrying value at march  and the second step of testing was required to be performed 
in the second step  the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company determined that the implied fair value of goodwill for the valves reporting unit was less than its carrying value by million which was recorded as a goodwill impairment charge in estimates about fair value used in the first step of the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 
the income approach is supported by other valuation approaches  such as similar transaction and guideline analyses 
under the income approach  the company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions among others 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
at december  the company had million of goodwill related to its propel and electronic components reporting units  which was tested for impairment and determined to not be impaired 
the company tests its long lived assets for recoverability at any time that an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may trigger a recoverability test include a significant change in the market price of similar long lived assets  a change in the use of the long lived asset due to product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate  industry or economic conditions  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  historical and projected operating losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or an expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the company reviews these factors quarterly to determine whether a trigger event has occurred 
as a result of the challenging economic environment in the company determined that the long lived asset groups should be tested for recoverability 
the company has seven asset groups  which are the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities 
projected cash flows for each asset group are forecasted by the controllers responsible for the business of each asset group and evaluated by management 
revenue forecasts for through were derived consistently with the company s long term planning and forecasting process  taking into account such factors as historical growth rates  foreseen changes in future product offerings  government regulations  and improving market conditions 
for years after the company assumed a percent growth rate 
in the company s testing at december   capital expenditures for maintenance were assumed to be approximately percent of revenues for the motors asset group and percent of revenues for the open circuit and steering asset groups due to the nature of the long lived assets included in each of the asset groups and planned capital expenditures to maintain the current long lived assets 
corporate costs for each functional area are forecasted  as well  and allocated to each asset group by the corporate controller using the same basis used for allocating actual costs for financial reporting 
allocated costs include sales and marketing  finance  human resources  and information technology 
each functional area is allocated based on an underlying allocation key 
for example  sales and marketing costs are allocated based on a periodic time study that determines the amount of time spent to sell and market products in each asset group  information technology costs are allocated base on the number of licensed users working for each asset group  and finance and human resources are allocated based on sales revenue recognized by each asset group as a percent of total revenues 
at december  the company tested its asset groups for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the net assets for each asset group to the number of years needed when summing the undiscounted operating cash flows for a projected period 
the company determined that no long lived assets were impaired 
four of the asset groups had excess cash flows that were significant and required no further evaluation 
the motors  open circuit and steering asset groups had lower levels of excess cash flow and were analyzed further as follows asset group projected cash flows over remaining life projection period carrying value of net assets excess motors open circuit steering number of years of projected cash flow needed to equal the carrying value of net assets 
for all three assets groups tested the projected operating cash flows during the life of the primary asset were sufficiently greater than the carrying value of the asset group  and therefore residual values of long lived assets at the end of that period were not quantified and additional testing to quantify the fair value of long lived assets was not performed 
although the current economic environment appears to be improving  if it were to decline and negatively impact the company s business  there can be no assurance that the company s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment testing as of december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if the company s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved  or the company s stock price were to decline  the company may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with the next annual impairment test or if a triggering event requires an earlier impairment test to be performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result  or if it does  whether the charge would be significant 
valuation of trade receivables the company records trade receivables due from its customers at the time a sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policy 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it believes may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables  looking at the historical losses incurred as a percentage of net sales  and by monitoring the financial strength of its customers regarding specific outstanding accounts receivable balances 
in addition  local customary practices have to be taken into account due to varying payment terms being applied in various parts of the world where the company conducts its business 
if the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it has filed for bankruptcy  the company establishes a specific allowance for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of trade receivables is reviewed quarterly 
workers compensation the company has an insurance policy to cover workers compensation claims in the us  in which the company pays the first million per claim  per incident 
the company establishes its workers compensation reserve based on historic growth factors of claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
us health care costs the company self insures its us health care costs for eligible employees and their qualified dependents with exposure for any one year  excluding prescription costs  limited to million per individual 
the company establishes reserves for its health care cost based on historic claims data and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a portion of its employees 
in certain countries  such as the us and the us  these plans are funded with plan assets whereas in other countries such as germany  the plans have historically been unfunded  which is customary 
in the company started contributing to the german pension plans 
the measurement of the company s pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and other experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates the company bases the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at or near year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy  and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and standard industry actuarial tables  respectively 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in such future periods 
the company s funding policy for the us plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
in the company anticipates contributing million to its us plans  million to its german plans  and million to its uk plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions the company provides postretirement health care benefits for certain employee groups in the us this plan is contributory and contains certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the company does not pre fund this plan and has the right to modify or terminate this plan in the future 
the postretirement liability  which is determined on an actuarial basis  is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at investment yield trends available near year end on corporate bonds rated aa 
in addition  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the health care cost trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the subsequent year 
as of december  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would impact the expense recognized in by million and would affect the postretirement benefit obligation by million 
in the company anticipates contributing million to this plan 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowances tax regulations may require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on a tax return  and some of the differences are temporary such as the rate of depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally are attributable to items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years but the amount has already been included as an expense in the financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions that have been taken on the tax return but have not been recognized as expense in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets reported on the consolidated balance sheets
