item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview fiscal net sales decreased to million from million in fiscal fiscal net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal the decrease in net sales for all product lines was mainly due to decreased sales caused by challenging retail market conditions 
fiscal was another challenging year for the powersports industry including arctic cat 
however  in spite of the challenges the company was able to greatly improve operating results and return the company to profitability on significantly lower sales levels  improve its market share in both product lines and improve the financial health of its dealer network by continuing to help them reduce their inventory 
in addition  the company improved its liquidity by ending the fiscal year with million in cash and short term investments 
the retail sales climate for all the company s products remained difficult in due to the severe contraction of the us economy which began in the last half of and continued throughout dramatically lower consumer spending as well as historically low consumer confidence and rising unemployment all contributed to industry wide weak retail demand 
industry wide retail sales of snowmobiles in north america declined this year 
however  like last year  snowmobile retail sales out performed every other recreational vehicle category in north america 
while retail sales of snowmobiles are certainly affected by the economic environment  they are also impacted by snow conditions 
in the us  snow conditions were generally good for the third year in a row  which helped snowmobile retail sales out perform the other recreational vehicle categories 
canada experienced very poor snow conditions throughout most of the eastern half of the country which had a significant negative impact on retail sales 
retail sales of arctic cat snowmobiles outperformed the industry and the company gained nearly three points of market share 
at the same time  the company reduced dealer inventories by 
dealer inventory reduction has been an ongoing part of the company s strategy for years and during that time  the company has reduced dealer inventories by 
overall  the company expects snowmobile sales to increase to in fiscal industry wide retail sales of atvs again declined throughout the year driven by the continued uncertainties in the economy  relatively weak consumer confidence and unemployment figures at near historic levels 
the company expects these same factors to impact retail sales of atvs throughout fiscal as well 
however  by year end  the company expects enough change in the overall economic environment so that retail sales declines will slow to about half the level experienced in the fiscal year 
the company s focus for fiscal will again be gaining market share and reducing dealer inventories 
during fiscal year  the company s atv business gained one point of market share in north america and the company s dealer inventories declined by over the prior year 
in view of the current north american economic environment  the company does not expect atv retail sales to improve over last year  although the company may see a slight uptick in the atv market by the end of fiscal if the economy begins to rebound 
as a result  the company expects atv sales to decrease to in fiscal atv sales decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal atv net sales first surpassed snowmobile net sales in fiscal and are the company s largest product line  comprising of net sales in fiscal snowmobile sales decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the planned reduction last fiscal year in snowmobile production to align dealer inventory with retail demand

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue and provides for estimated marketing and sales incentive costs when products are shipped to dealers and distributors pursuant to their order  the price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has agreements with finance companies to repurchase products repossessed up to certain limits 
the company s financial exposure to repurchase products is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company and the resale value of the repossessed products 
historically  the company has not incurred material losses as a result of repurchases nor has it provided a financial reserve for repurchases 
adverse changes in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
marketing and sales incentive costs the company provides for various marketing and sales incentive costs which are offered to its dealers and consumers at the later of when the revenue is recognized or when the marketing and sales incentive program is approved and communicated 
examples of these costs include dealer and consumer rebates  dealer floorplan financing assistance and other incentive and promotion programs 
adverse market conditions resulting in lower than expected retail sales or the matching of competitor programs could cause accrued marketing and incentive costs to materially increase if the company authorizes and communicates new programs to its dealers 
the company estimates marketing and sales incentive costs based on expected usage and historical experience 
the related marketing and sales incentive costs accrual as of march  and was million and million  respectively  and included in accrued marketing in the company s balance sheet 
the decrease in this accrual was a result of current announced and communicated marketing and sales incentive programs and retail market conditions 
historically  marketing and sales incentive program expenses have been within our expectations 
to the extent current experience differs with previous estimates the accrued liability for marketing and sales incentives is adjusted accordingly 

table of contents product warranties the company generally provides a limited warranty to the owner of snowmobiles for months from the date of consumer registration and for months on atvs 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical rates and trends and makes subsequent adjustments to their estimate as actual claims become known or the amounts are determinable 
adverse changes in actual warranty costs compared to the company s initial estimates could cause accrued warranty costs to materially change 
the accrued warranty costs as of march  and was million and million  respectively 
historically  actual warranty costs have been within our expectations 
inventories our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost based on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically assess inventories for obsolescence and potential excess 
this assessment is based primarily on assumptions and estimates regarding future production demands  anticipated changes in technology or design  historical and expected future sales patterns 
our inventories consist of materials and products that are subject to changes in our planned production of future snowmobile and atv products and competitive market conditions which may cause lower of cost or market adjustments to our finished goods inventory 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory items that are identified as obsolete or excess are fully reserved on our balance sheet and are generally scrapped 
historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess costs adjustments have been within our expectations 
product liability and litigation the company is subject to product liability claims and other litigation in the normal course of business 
the company insures for product liability claims although it retains a modest self insured retention accrual within the balance sheet caption insurance 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses over insured amounts are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate loss 
adverse changes in the final determination of product liability or other claims made against the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
historically  actual product liability and litigation costs have been within our expectations 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation based on certain assumption inputs within the black scholes model 
these assumption inputs are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment 
the company accounts for stock based payment awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and the company employs 
table of contents different assumptions in the application of asc the amount of compensation expense associated with asc may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of the company s snowmobile production cycle and the lead time between the commencement of snowmobile and atv production in the early spring and commencement of shipments late in the first quarter have resulted in significant fluctuations in the company s working capital requirements during the year 
the following table represents sales and ending inventories by each of the quarters in the years ended march  and first second third fourth total atv snowmobile pg a total sales inventories atv snowmobile pg a total sales inventories as a result of the company s better matching of atv production to wholesale and retail demand for atv units  the company s finished goods inventory balance decreased as of march  compared with march  historically  the company has financed its working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short term bank borrowings during the middle of the cycle 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations together with working capital financing through its available line of credit will provide sufficient funds to finance the company on a short and long term basis 
however  given the turmoil in the economy and banking sector  there can be no assurance that adequate working capital financing arrangements will remain available or that the costs and other terms of such new financing arrangements will not be significantly less favorable to the company than has historically been available 
cash and short term investments cash and short term investments increased to  at march  from  at march  because of improved profitability and working capital management 
the company s cash balances traditionally peak early in the fourth quarter and then decrease as working capital requirements increase when the company s snowmobile and spring atv production cycles begin 
the company s investment objectives are first  safety of principal and second  rate of return

the company s agreements with tfc to floorplan its canadian dealers terminates april  on december   textron announced plans to exit the non captive dealer floorplan business 
while the company anticipates securing another dealer floorplan source for its canadian dealers at acceptable terms and conditions before the termination of its agreements with tfc  there can be no assurance that an alternative source will be secured before termination of its agreements with tfc or that the costs and other terms of such new financing source will not be significantly less favorable to the company than has historically been available 
the financing agreements require repurchase of repossessed new and unused units and set limits upon the company s potential liability for annual repurchases 
the aggregate potential liability was approximately  at march  the company has incurred no material losses under these agreements 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations provide sufficient funding in the event there is a requirement to perform under this guarantee and repurchase agreement
