item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses 
in the course of its business  the corporation may acquire  through foreclosure  properties securing loans it has originated or purchased that are in default 
particularly in real estate commercial lending  there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties 
in this event  the corporation might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at the corporation s sole cost and expense 
the cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties 
the corporation may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties 
these events could have an adverse effect on the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the corporation depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers 
in deciding whether to extend credit to customers  the corporation may rely on information provided to it by its customers  including financial statements and other financial information 
the corporation may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
the corporation s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that the corporation extends credit in reliance on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are misleading or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading 
general economic conditions in the state of michigan could be less favorable than expected 
the corporation is affected by general economic conditions in the united states  although most directly within michigan 
since december  the united states has been in a recession  while the state of michigan has experienced economic difficulties since at least business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly 
a further economic downturn or continued weak business environment within michigan could further negatively impact household and corporate incomes 
this impact may lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans 
the corporation s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of michigan and the specific local markets in which the corporation operates 
the local economic conditions in these local markets have a significant impact on the demand for the corporation s products and services as well as the ability of the corporation s customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the corporation s deposit funding sources 
economic conditions experienced in the state of michigan have been more adverse than in the united states generally  and these conditions are not expected to significantly improve in the near future 
substantially all of the corporation s loans are to individuals and businesses in michigan 
consequently  any further or prolonged decline in michigan s economy could have a materially adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
a significant further decline or a prolonged period of the lack of improvement in general economic conditions  whether caused by recession  inflation  unemployment  changes in securities markets  acts of terrorism  other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if chemical does not adjust to changes in the financial services industry  its financial performance may suffer 
chemical s ability to maintain its financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to maintain and grow its core deposit customer base and expand its financial services to its existing and or new customers 
in addition to other banks  competitors include savings associations  credit unions  securities dealers  brokers  mortgage bankers  investment advisors and finance and insurance companies 
the increasingly competitive environment is  in part  a result of changes in the economic environment within the state of michigan  regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers 
new competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for chemical s customers and services 
financial services and products are also constantly changing 
chemical s financial performance will also depend in part upon customer demand for chemical s products and services and chemical s ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks 
for example  consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits 
changes in interest rates could reduce chemical s income and cash flow 
chemical s net income and cash flow depends  to a great extent  on the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
market interest rates are beyond chemical s control  and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions  the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  including  in particular  the federal reserve board  and competition 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships  will influence the origination of loans  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the interest rate received on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  any significant adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s results of operations  or any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
see the sections captioned net interest income and market risk in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s management of interest rate risk 
the corporation may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the fdic  which could negatively impact earnings 
recent insured institution failures  as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions  have significantly increased fdic loss provisions  resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio to historical lows 
insured institution failures could remain elevated  thus  the reserve ratio may continue to decline despite the fdic s efforts to increase the reserve ratio 
in addition  the helping families save their homes act temporarily increased the limit on fdic coverage to  through december  depending upon the magnitude of future losses that the fdic insurance fund suffers  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases or assessments in order to replenish the fund 
the fdic may need to set a higher base rate schedule based on future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections 
potentially higher fdic assessment rates than those currently projected or additional special assessments could have an adverse impact on the corporation s results of operations 
the corporation is subject to liquidity risk in its operations  which could adversely affect its ability to fund various obligations 
liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is required to fund various obligations  including credit obligations to borrowers  loan originations  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention  principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding 

table of contents the corporation may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to corporation common stock as to distributions and in liquidation  which could negatively affect the value of corporation common stock 
in the future  the corporation may increase its capital resources by entering into debt or debt like financing or issuing debt or equity securities  which could include issuances of senior notes  subordinated notes  preferred stock or common stock 
in the event of the corporation s liquidation  its lenders and holders of its debt securities would receive a distribution of the corporation s available assets before distributions to the holders of corporation common stock 
the corporation s decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control 
the corporation cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of its future offerings and debt financings 
future offerings could reduce the value of shares of corporation common stock and dilute a shareholder s interest in the corporation 
evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or future recovery prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period 
estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred 
the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments is based upon the corporation s quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
additionally  the corporation s management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the corporation s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the corporation may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
the corporation tests goodwill at least annually for impairment 
impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
substantially all of the corporation s goodwill at december  was recorded on the books of chemical bank 
the fair value of chemical bank is impacted by the performance of its business and other factors 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  the corporation must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 
such write downs could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial position 
deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable 
factors in management s determination include the performance of the corporation  including the ability to generate taxable net income 
if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income 
as of december   the corporation did not carry a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
future facts and circumstances may require a valuation allowance 
charges to establish a valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial position 

table of contents the corporation may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions  which may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
chemical and its subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business 
the corporation s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it  and any claims asserted against it  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may harm its reputation or cause chemical to incur unexpected expenses  which could be material in amount 
should the ultimate expenses  judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the corporation s insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the corporation may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms  if at all 
the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area 
the corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national and regional banks within the various markets where the corporation operates 
the corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
the corporation competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making new loans 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry into the market and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 
many of the corporation s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the corporation can 
the corporation s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets the ability to expand the corporation s market position the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the rate at which the corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors customer satisfaction with the corporation s level of service industry and general economic trends failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the corporation s competitive position  which could adversely affect the corporation s growth and profitability  which in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the corporation s internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
a significant failure or circumvention of the corporation s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential acquisitions may disrupt the corporation s business and dilute shareholder value 
the corporation seeks merger or acquisition partners  including fdic assisted acquisitions  that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things the recording of assets and liabilities of the target company at fair value may materially dilute shareholder value at the transaction date and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
table of contents the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion the diversion of the corporation s management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses the introduction of new products and services into the corporation s business potential disruption to the corporation s business the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on the corporation s results of operations the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company difficulty in estimating the value of the target company potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company the transactions may be more expensive to complete and the anticipated benefits  including cost savings and strategic gains  may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events  including the economic and financial conditions within the state of michigan 
also  the corporation may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to its current shareholders 
the corporation regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  dilution of the corporation s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
if the corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
the corporation is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support its operations 
the corporation may need to raise additional capital to support its continued growth 
the corporation s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the corporation s control  and on its financial performance 
the corporation cannot assure that it will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to the corporation 
if the corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially limited 
chemical financial corporation relies on dividends from its subsidiary bank for most of its revenue 
chemical financial corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiary bank  chemical bank 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from chemical bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends on the corporation s common stock 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that chemical bank may pay to chemical financial corporation 
in the event chemical bank is unable to pay dividends to chemical financial corporation  the corporation may not be able to pay cash dividends on the corporation s common stock 
the earnings of chemical bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders 
over the long term  cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings  as well as capital requirements  regulatory restraints and other factors affecting chemical bank 
due to the strength of the corporation s capital position  the corporation has the financial ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the earnings of chemical bank 
the length of time the corporation can sustain cash dividends to shareholders in excess of the current earnings of chemical bank is dependent on the magnitude of the earnings shortfall  the capital levels of both chemical bank and the corporation and obtaining regulatory 
table of contents approval 
as of december   chemical bank could not pay additional dividends to the corporation without approval from the federal reserve  as dividends paid during exceeded net income of chemical bank in and  combined
