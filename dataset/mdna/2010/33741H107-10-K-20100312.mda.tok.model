item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
subsequent events in january  trust iii issued million in trust preferred securities to third party investors  and the corporation issued million in underlying junior subordinated debentures 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
the net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  compared to net income available to common shareholders of million for basic and diluted losses per common share for the year ended december  were  compared to basic and diluted income per common share of for the decrease in net income resulted primarily from an increase of million of other than temporary impairment charges related to available for sale securities  million in increased loan loss provision expense and million of increased fdic deposit insurance premiums 
the increase in fdic premiums resulted from the special assessment charge of 
million recognized in june  the revised fdic rate structure and the credit which offset premiums charged 
core operations remained strong as our net interest income for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period of our net interest margin decreased from at december  to at december  as a result of an increase in non accruing loans and management s desire to increase our liquidity position 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities decreased million due to the low interest rate environment  our decision to only increase special pricing for full relationship customers and certificates of deposit renewing at lower interest rates due to the short duration of our portfolio 
the increased provision was necessary to provide specific allocations for impaired loans where management has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance and due to increases in the qualitative factors affecting the allowance for loan losses as a result of the current recession and distressed economic environment 
other operating income decreased million during when compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the recognition of million in other than temporary impairment charges and 
million realized losses on the investment portfolio 
trust department income and income earned on bank owned life insurance have also declined as compared to due to decreases in the market values of assets under management and reduced interest rates  respectively 
management has also noted a decrease in consumer spending as service charge income has shown a decline of million during the months of these declines were offset slightly by million of increased insurance commissions as a result of the insurance group s acquisition of books of business late in operating expenses increased million in when compared to this increase is due primarily to a million increase of fdic premiums  which is inclusive of the million special assessment charge  and increases in personnel costs  other real estate owned expenses  and amortization of intangibles 
operations in were impacted by the following factors and strategic initiatives loan and deposit growth impact on net interest margin we experienced a decrease of million in loans in when compared to the residential mortgage and construction portfolio decreased million and a decrease in the installment portfolio of million 
these decreases were offset by growth of million in the commercial portfolio as a result of in house production and commercial participations with other financial institutions 
we experienced growth in both fixed rate and adjustable rate products 
interest income on loans in decreased from the amount generated in by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to the decrease in interest rates  flat rate environment throughout  and the increase in non accrual loans 
interest income on investment securities decreased slightly by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to a million decrease in the portfolio 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table that appears on page 
funding costs in decreased as a result of the flat interest rate environment throughout and the enhanced efforts of the internal treasury committee 
deposits at december  increased million when compared to deposits at december   primarily from a million increase in our ira and regular certificates of deposit as a result of month and month specials offset by declines in interest bearing demand and savings products 
although deposits increased during  the decline in the interest rate environment decreased deposit interest expense by million when compared to the reduction in interest expense resulted in a slight increase in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in when compared to the overall net interest margin decreased during to from in on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income decreased million during the months of when compared to the same period of the decrease is primarily attributable to the recognition of million in other than temporary impairment charges  a 
million realized loss on the investment portfolio  as a result of moving four securities to trading  and a decrease of million in service charge income due to decreased consumer spending 
trust department revenue and income on our bank owned life insurance policies also decreased due to declines in the market values of assets under management and reduced interest rates  respectively 
these declines were offset slightly by a 
million increase in insurance commissions as a result of the insurance group s acquisition of books of business in december trust department income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets and by the amount of assets under management 
although we experienced favorable sales production in our trust department  unfavorable market conditions have reduced the fees and commissions on our existing accounts under management resulting in slightly lower income when compared to in  declining market values negatively impacted the value of assets under management and the resultant fees 
this decline in market values began to reverse in assets under management were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
securities losses are the most variable component of other operating income 
during  we recorded non cash charges of approximately million as a result of an other than temporary impairment analysis performed on our investment portfolio 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
other operating expenses increased million for when compared to the increase was due to increases in personnel expenses  occupancy and equipment expenses as we continued our expansion in morgantown  west virginia  frederick  maryland and in the markets served by the insurance group 
in addition  expense for the corporation s defined benefit pension plan increased million in when compared to this increase is a result of the decline in market value of the plan assets and the lower discount rate 
we also recognized increases in other expenses directly attributable to the fdic assessments of million when compared to the same time period in dividends the corporation continued its tradition of paying dividends to shareholders during  which totaled per share 
the corporation has paid quarterly cash dividends consistently since  the year in which it was formed 
in december  the corporation reduced its quarterly dividend to 
per common share effective for the dividend payable on february  as noted above  the corporation is generally prohibited from increasing this dividend above 
per share without the prior consent of the treasury until the earlier of i january  or ii the date on which the treasury no longer holds any shares of the series a preferred stock 
looking forward we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  fluctuations in interest rates and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in item under the caption allowance for loan losses and in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have 
million of core deposit intangible assets and million related to acquisitions of insurance books of business which are subject to amortization 
the million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
asc topic requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
management has completed its annual evaluation for impairment and concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities available for sale securities available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component in shareholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums to the first call date  if applicable  or to maturity  and for accretion of discounts to maturity  or in the case of mortgage backed securities  over the estimated life of the security 
such amortization and accretion  plus interest and dividends  are included in interest income from investments 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of new accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in topic asc section  which the corporation early adopted effective march  according to the effective date provisions of asc paragraph  management assesses whether a it has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses  which are recognized in other comprehensive loss 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  and the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments other beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  asc section 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
fair value of investments our entire investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and is therefore carried at fair value 
we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
the corporation measures the fair market values of its investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in topic the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  part ii of this annual report discusses new accounting pronouncements that when adopted  may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is our largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent fte basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income on an fte basis increased million during over the same period in due to a million decrease in interest expense  offset by a million decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from a decrease in interest rates on loans  an increase in non accrual assets and our desire to maintain higher cash levels when compared to a reversal of approximately  is reflected in the other interest earning assets line item for december  due to the accrual of stock dividends issued by the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta at a rate of for the fourth quarter of the corporation was notified during the first quarter of that the fhlb of atlanta would not pay a dividend for the fourth quarter the decreases in interest rates throughout and the increase in non accrual assets during contributed to the decrease in the average rate on our average earning assets of basis points  from at december  to for december  on a fully tax equivalent basis 
interest expense decreased during when compared to the same period of due primarily to the significantly low level of interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
average interest bearing liabilities increased during by million when compared to  with interest bearing deposits increasing by approximately million 
the effect of the decreasing rate environment throughout and continuing into  our decision to only increase special rates for full relationship customers and the short duration of our portfolio resulted in a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for the months ended december  to for the same period of the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point decrease in the net interest margin during the months of to from for the same time period of comparing to  net interest income increased million in over the same period in  due to a million increase in interest income coupled with a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to the increased level of interest earning assets is attributable to the growth that we experienced in our loan and investment portfolios during the declines in the interest rates throughout contributed to the decrease in the average yield on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
the average yield on loans decreased by basis points and the yield on investment securities as a percentage of interest earning assets was stable in although we experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million in  interest expense decreased million due to the decline in interest rates and the enhanced efforts of the internal treasury committee 
average deposits increased in by approximately million 
effective management of both retail and wholesale interest rates resulted in a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for to for the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point increase in the net interest margin at december  to from at december  as shown below  the composition of total interest income between and shifted towards interest and fees on loans 
this was the result of accumulating cash from calls on securities in the investment portfolio in order to enhance our liquidity position 
the composition of total interest income between and shows a slight increase in interest on investments and a corresponding decline in interest and fees on loans 
this shift is attributable to the leverage strategies implemented throughout and leverage strategies are the purchase of investment securities funded by borrowings of matched terms and durations 
the difference between the rate earned and the rate paid has resulted in additional earnings 
management has more control over the rates  duration and structure of the investment portfolio as compared to the loan portfolio which is customized to the individual needs of each borrower 
as such  the investment portfolio is used as a supplement to our asset liability management process

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of the increase in the provision for loan losses for when compared to was in response to the increase in net charge offs and non performing loans  the results of our quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the qualitative factors affecting the allowance  and specific allocations for impaired loans 
as part of our loan review process  management noted an increase in foreclosures and bankruptcies in the geographic areas where we operate 
additionally  the current economic environment has caused a decline in real estate sales 
consequently  we have closely reviewed and applied sensitivity analysis to collateral values to more adequately measure potential future losses 
where necessary  we have obtained new appraisals on collateral 
specific allocations of the allowance have been provided in these instances where losses may occur 
the provision for loan losses was million for  compared to million for the increase in the provision in was due to increased net charge offs  an increase in the level of non accrual loans  loan growth during  specific allocations for impaired loans and changes in the qualitative factors used in the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

trust department income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets and by the amount of assets under management

insurance commissions increased in when compared to due to the acquisition of a book of business in december insurance commissions decreased from to due to a soft insurance market resulting in lower premium income and a reduction in the amount of contingency income received in contingency income is received from the insurance carriers based upon claims histories and varies from year to year 
securities losses gains are the most variable component of other operating income 
during and  we recorded non cash charges of approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of an other than temporary impairment analysis performed on our investment portfolio throughout each year 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
this charge was offset by gains realized from sales of investment securities and calls on fixed income bonds 
during  we recorded a non recurring pre tax charge of approximately million million or 
per share  net of tax associated with the transfer of certain investment securities from the available for sale category to the trading category during the first quarter of and the subsequent sale of those securities during the second quarter 
this sale of securities was part of our overall restructuring of the investment portfolio designed to improve overall earnings from the portfolio 
we experienced an increase in other income during primarily due to a million gain realized as a result of the exercise of eminent domain rights by a governmental entity relating to one of our retail branch sites 
this increase was offset by reduced bank owned life insurance earnings 
this decline is attributable to the overall decrease in the interest rate environment throughout and the movement of our separate account policy to a money market fund in order to protect principal 
in december  management surrendered this policy 
a new boli purchase was made in november which is projected to increase the overall return on this portfolio in we also recognized a decline in secondary market fees

salaries and employee benefits represent approximately of total other operating expenses in  compared to in and in in addition  expense for the corporation s defined benefit pension plan increased million in the months of when compared to the same period of this increase is a result of the decline in market value of the plan assets and the lower discount rate 
in response to the current banking environment  the fdic substantially increased deposit premiums for all insured banks in this resulted in a million increase in our premium expense when compared to these premiums increased slightly from to as the credits related to the assessment were applied during and occupancy and equipment expenses increased by 
million from to and 
million from to these increases relate to the growth and expansion of the bank s retail network and the opening of our operations center during other expenses increased slightly by

applicable income taxes due to the net loss incurred in  we recognized a net tax benefit of million  compared to million and million of income tax expense in and and effective tax rates  respectively 
the net tax benefit generated in resulted primarily from the non cash other than temporary impairment charges on our investment portfolio of million and the increased loan loss provision 
the effective tax rates in and are slightly less than the statutory rate due to the level of tax exempt income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes for detailed analysis of the corporation s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the state tax loss carry forwards included in deferred tax assets which will expire commencing in we have concluded that no valuation allowance is deemed necessary for our remaining federal and state net deferred tax assets at december  as it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on the following the expected reversal of all but million of the total million of deferred tax liabilities at december  in such a manner to substantially utilize the dollar for dollar impact against the deferred tax assets at december   the available carry back available to our tax return to obtain a tax refund of tax paid in that year  if needed  based on deferred tax reversals  and for the remaining excess deferred tax assets that will not be utilized by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our expected future income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets as they reverse or before any net operating loss  if created  would expire 
we will need to generate taxable income in future years of approximately million to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets in the years in which they are expected to reverse 
management estimates that we can fully utilized the deferred tax assets in approximately four to five years based on the historical pre tax income and forecasts of estimated future pre tax income as adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
consolidated balance sheet review overview our total assets reached billion at december   representing an increase of million from year end the total interest earning asset mix at december  shows a slight decline in the percentage of loans and investments as a percentage of total assets from to as we increased our cash and cash equivalents for liquidity purposes

we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate and  to a lesser extent  equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for any of the periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio dollars in thousands table loans outstanding as of december commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment real estate construction total loans comparing loans at december  to loans at december   our loan portfolio has decreased by million 
continued growth in commercial loans million was offset by a decline in our residential mortgage and construction portfolio million and a decline in our installment portfolio million 
the decrease in installment loans is primarily attributable to a decline in the indirect loan portfolio resulting from a slowdown in economic activity and management s de emphasis of this form of lending product 
indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at december   at december  and at december  the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio is attributable to the increased amount of loan refinancings that have occurred in the current low interest rate environment during the past months as consumers seek long term fixed rate loans 
we used secondary market outlets to satisfy these loan requests 
the decrease in construction loans is due to the current recession which has had a material and adverse effect on economic growth and the housing market 
the growth in the commercial portfolio is a result of continuous growth in our new market areas and funding of previous loan commitments 
at december   approximately of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate  compared to at december  and at december  at december   adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at december  fixed interest rate loans made up of the total loan portfolio at december  and  compared to of total loans at december during  gross loans increased by million  or  over this growth was focused in our commercial million and residential mortgage million loan portfolios  offset by a decline in installment million and remains consistent with management s objectives over the past several years 
continued efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at december   adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at december  commercial loans increased in  following a increase in the growth in the commercial portfolio is a result of both in house production and participations with other institutions 
residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  in when compared to the growth in the residential portfolio consists of both adjustable and fixed rate products 
consumer installment loans decreased by million in  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s continued shift toward more commercial loans with less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market and indirect car dealer loans 
the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  in thousands maturities of loan portfolio at december  table maturing within one year after one but within five years maturing after five years total commercial real estate mortgage installment real estate construction total loans classified by sensitivity to change in interest rates fixed interest rate loans adjustable interest rate loans total loans our policy is to place loans on non accrual status  except for consumer loans  whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors the status of all non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due 
table sets forth the amounts of non accrual  past due and restructured loans dollars in thousands for the past five years risk elements of loan portfolio table at december non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more total total as percentage of total loans restructured loans performing non accrual included above total restructured other real estate owned at december non accrual type commercial residential mortgage installment residential construction total non accrual loans as a of applicable portfolio commercial residential mortgage installment residential construction interest income not recognized as a result of placing loans on non accrual status was million during  million during and million during interest income not recognized as a result of rate modifications on restructured loans was million in and none in and we have seen an increase in non accrual loans in and primarily due to the effects of the recession on our acquisition and development portfolio  which is in the commercial portfolio 
the amount of restructured loans increased significantly in as we have made every effort to work with our borrowers during this distressed economic environment 
at december   performing restructured loans were comprised of approximately million of commercial real estate land development loans  million of other commercial real estate loans  million of commercial and industrial loans  and million of single family mortgage loans 
the objective of the restructurings was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge offs 
restructured terms can include temporary relief of contractual principal payments  temporary or permanent reductions of the interest rate  and maturity extensions 
for loans that were originally interest only credit lines  if the maturity date is extended  the restructured loan is placed on a principal amortization schedule 
restructured loans are considered performing if they have made at least six consecutive payments of their original and modified terms 
restructured loans are evaluated for impairment as required by applicable accounting guidance 
allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
we use the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
the two pools are further segmented by loan type and by loan classification  including uncriticized pass  other assets especially mentioned and substandard 
the uncriticized pass pools for commercial real estate and residential real estate are further segmented based upon the geographic locations of the underlying collateral 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non accrual loans  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist that are considered impaired and in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a significant increase in the balance of non accrual loans  from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly and reflect the current economic environment  an increase in impaired loans from million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in non accrual loans and impaired loans consist primarily of real estate development loans and commercial real estate that have experienced a slowdown in the level of sales activity during the current year 
all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  secondary sources of repayment  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of these extensive reviews  some specific allocations of the allowance were made to several loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to of total loans  which was times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
performing loans considered impaired loans  as defined and identified by management  amounted to million at december  loans are identified as impaired when the loan is classified as substandard and management determines that it is probable that the borrower will not be able to pay principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan 
these loans consist primarily of acquisition and development loans 
the fair values are generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds 
specific allocations have been made where management believes there is insufficient collateral and no secondary source of repayment is available 
during  there was significant coverage in the media regarding the topic of sub prime loans and the resulting increase in loan delinquencies and foreclosures 
a sub prime loan is defined generally as a loan to a borrower with a weak credit record or a reduced repayment capacity 
these borrowers typically pose a higher risk of default and foreclosure 
we generally do not make sub prime loans 
if credit is extended to a sub prime borrower  the decision to lend is based on the presence of facts and circumstances that management believes mitigate the risks inherent in this type of loan 
as of december   management believes that our loss exposure arising from the sub prime loan market is minimal 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a significant increase in the balance of non accrual loans  from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly  an increase in impaired loans from million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in non accrual loans and impaired loans consist primarily of real estate development loans and commercial real estate that have experienced a slowdown in the level of sales activity during the current year 
all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during the fourth quarter of as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  secondary sources of repayment  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of this extensive review  some specific allocations of the allowance were made to several of these loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to of total loans  which was times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of december  table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

changes in the allocation over time reflect changes in the composition of the loan portfolio risk profile and refinements to the methodology of determining the allowance

for additional information  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
the following sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio available for sale  reported at fair value  by major category as of the indicated dates in thousands december  amortized cost fair value fv fv as of total amortized cost fair value fv fv as of total amortized cost fair value fv fv as of total securities available for sale us government and agencies residential mortgage backed agencies collateralized mortgage obligations obligation of states and political subdivisions collateralized debt obligations total investment securities have decreased million since december  us government agencies decreased by million during primarily due to calls in the portfolio 
residential mortgage backed agencies decreased by million and collateralized mortgage obligations decreased slightly by million as a result of increased paydowns on the underlying loans 
the collateralized debt obligations portfolio consists primarily of trust preferred securities issued by trust subsidiaries of financial institutions and insurance companies that are collateralized by junior subordinated debentures issued by those parent institutions 
the million decrease in this sector is due to a decline in the fair value of these securities directly attributable to the current economic environment and its impact on the financial services industry as well as realized losses recognized in as a result of other than temporary impairment charges 
the decreases in these sectors were offset by a slight increase in state and political subdivisions of million 
at december   the securities classified as available for sale included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities in the portfolio 
the comparable amount at december  was an unrealized loss of million 
typically  the fair values of securities available for sale will generally decrease whenever interest rates increase  and the fair values will typically increase in a declining rate environment 
however  fair values have also been affected by factors such as marketability  liquidity and the current economic environment 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report  the corporation measures fair market values based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
in april  fasb issued additional guidance in asc subparagraphs a and b on determining when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased and provides a list of factors that a reporting entity should evaluate to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
when the reporting entity concludes there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability  further analysis of the information from that market is needed and significant adjustments to the related prices may be necessary to estimate fair value 
the new guidance also clarifies in asc subparagraphs e and f that when there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability  some transactions may not be orderly 
in those situations  the entity must evaluate the weight of the evidence to determine whether the transaction is orderly 
the guidance provides a list of circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
level prices or valuation techniques require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and are not readily observable in the market ie supported with little or no market activity 
these level instruments are valued based on both observable and unobservable inputs derived from the best available data  some of which is internally developed  and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
approximately million of our securities available for sale were valued using significant unobservable inputs level assets 
these securities are pooled trust preferred securities and are classified as collateralized debt obligations and contributed approximately million to the unrealized loss reported in our accumulated other comprehensive loss on the statement of financial condition 
the terms of the debentures underlying trust preferred securities allow the issuer of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to quarters  and  in such case  the terms of the related trust preferred securities allow their issuers to defer dividend payments for up to quarters 
some of the issuers of the trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio have defaulted and or deferred payments ranging from to of the total collateral balances underlying the securities 
the securities were designed to include structural features that provide investors with credit enhancement or support to provide default protection by subordinated tranches 
these features include over collateralization of the notes or subordination  excess interest or spread which will redirect funds in situations where collateral is insufficient  and a specified order of principal payments 
there are securities in our portfolio that are under collateralized which does represent additional stress on our tranche 
however  in these cases  the terms of the securities require excess interest to be redirected from subordinate tranches as credit support  which provides additional support to our investment 
as part of its other than temporary impairment analysis  management reviewed all of the underlying issuers for each trust preferred security in the portfolio 
various credit factors were analyzed and as a result  management identified issuers we considered to represent collateral at risk 
the total collateral at risk for each security was then compared to the amount of collateral that would need to move to deferral or default in order to cause a break in yield for a given class of bonds 
a break in yield means that deferrals or defaults have reached such a level that the tranche would not receive all of the contractual cash flows principal and interest by the maturity date 
this is indicative of a permanent credit loss 
this information was reviewed along with the results of the cash flow tests described below to assess whether a security is other than temporarily impaired 
the following table provides a summary of these securities and the credit status of the securities as of december  level investment securities available for sale dollars in thousands investment description first united level investments security credit status deal class book value fair market value unrealized gain loss lowest credit rating original collateral deferrals defaults as of original collateral performing collateral collateral support collateral support as of performing collateral collateral at risk internal assessment number of performing issuers total issuers preferred term security i mezz cc preferred term security xi b cc preferred term security xv b cc preferred term security xvi c cc preferred term security xvii c cc preferred term security xvii c cc preferred term security xviii c ccc preferred term security xviii c ccc preferred term security xix c cc preferred term security xix c cc preferred term security xix c cc preferred term security xix c cc preferred term security xxii c c preferred term security xxii c c preferred term security xxiii c ccc preferred term security xxiii d cc preferred term security xxiii d cc preferred term security xxiv c cc preferred term security i p i b b preferred term security i p iv b b preferred term security i p iv b b total level securities available for sale security has been deemed other than temporarily impaired and loss has been recognized in accordance with asc section management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of new accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in topic asc section management must assess whether a it has the intent to sell the security and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses 
the other losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the security  changes in the rating of a security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  and the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
due to the duration and the significant market value decline in the pooled trust preferred securities held in our portfolio  we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether or not an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
twenty two of the pooled trust preferred securities in our portfolio have been in an unrealized loss position for over months 
although some of the securities have been in a loss position for over one year  this is not an automatic indication of an other than temporary impairment 
rather  individual facts and circumstances may indicate that a decline in fair value longer than months may be temporary 
given the extraordinary market conditions prevalent over the past year and the economic recession  additional consideration has been given to the length of time the securities have been in a loss position and the likelihood that a market recovery will be longer than an otherwise orderly market would dictate 
the factors to be considered in reaching a conclusion about the existence of impairment may be both subjective and objective and include knowledge and experience about past and current events as well as assumptions about future events 
in the case of the trust preferred securities  the decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions in the market  adverse conditions in the financial industry  as well as adverse conditions related to the underlying issuers of the securities all of whom operate in the financial services industry 
the significant deterioration of the sub prime mortgage market during the past two years has resulted in the occurrence of unprecedented events in the financial services industry 
large banking houses and investment firms have gone out of business and or consolidated  many banks have been closed by regulators and the capital structures of many organizations have significantly weakened 
these events  in turn  have significantly and adversely affected all sectors of the local  national and global economies and have contributed to a national and worldwide liquidity and credit crisis 
the frb and other agencies of the us government have taken steps to lower interest rates  inject capital into banks and financial companies  establish outlets to sell troubled assets and have developed programs to modify troubled mortgage loans 
the new accounting guidance in asc topic was provided to relieve the uncertainties of fair market accounting applications in markets where there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity resulting in non orderly transactions and in asc topic to provide relief from other than temporary impairment not related to credit problems 
the fair market values of the pooled trust preferred securities have shown the effects of all of these factors because the underlying issuers all operate in some aspect of the financial services industry  most of them community banks 
the economic environment and its impact on the financial services industry have virtually eliminated the market for the pooled trust preferred securities in our portfolio 
management has determined that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in these securities 
there are few recent transactions in the market for these securities relative to historical levels 
there were no new pooled trust preferred issuances during or trading activity for pooled trust preferred securities indicates only three total trades during the first quarter of  zero trades during the second quarter of and only distressed trades during the third and fourth quarters of  compared to a high of trades in the first quarter of the volume is sporadic with in trades during the first and second quarters of  million during the third quarter and million during the fourth quarter of  representing primarily distressed sales 
the trading and issuance data presented  along with information from traders  indicates that there is currently an inactive and inefficient market in pooled trust preferred securities which is contributing to the depressed pricing on these securities 
price quotations are clearly indicative of distressed trades and vary significantly from prices achieved during an active market 
comparing each issuer s estimate of cash flows and  taking into consideration all available market data and nonperformance risk  there is a significant increase in the implied liquidity risk premiums and yields on the securities 
this has led to a wide bid ask spread as buyers for the securities are seeking fire sale prices and owners of the securities are not willing to accept such pricing 
all of the above mentioned issues  coupled with the general interest rate environment  have had an adverse impact on the underlying banks and insurance company issuers of the pooled trust preferred securities 
the generally accepted accounting principles that we use to prepare our financial statements require management to consider all available evidence in its evaluation of the realizable value of an investment 
judgment is required to determine whether factors exist that indicate an impairment loss has been incurred at the end of a reporting period 
the judgment may be based on both subjective and objective factors 
at the time of purchase  nineteen of the trust preferred securities were rated a and seven were rated bbb 
in its analysis  management considered the current credit ratings as part of its overall evaluation of the underlying collateral 
management also recognizes that there have been instances over the past several months where highly rated securities have failed 
two of the preferred term securities in our portfolio were downgraded by moody s in the fourth quarter of and an additional eight were downgraded in march during the quarter ended june   the remaining preferred term securities in our portfolio were downgraded below investment grade by fitch ratings 
due to the credit downgrades  management performed an in depth analysis of the underlying issuers in every trust preferred security owned by the corporation and shock tests of collateral values were performed in order to determine how much stress the securities could withstand before a loss in principal would be experienced 
for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments other beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  asc section  management also monitors cash flow projections for significant adverse changes 
the guidance removes the requirement to estimate cash flows from the views of a market participant but rather to base the estimate of cash flows on current information and events 
further  in making the other than temporary assessment  the holder should consider all relevant information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts when estimating future cash flows 
this information should include remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
the guidance in asc subtopic requires that the present value of the current estimated cash flows be compared to the present value of cash flows at the last reporting date 
if the present value of the original cash flows estimated at the initial transaction date or at the last date previously revised is greater than the present value of the current estimated cash flows  the change is considered adverse that is  an other than temporary impairment should be considered to have occurred 
the following assumptions were used in our cash flow tests default rate applied annually to bank and insurance collateral  recovery after two years based upon fdic data  the default data since the late s demonstrates that bif bank insurance fund insured institutions defaulted at a rate of approximately basis points bps per year 
based upon am best number of impairments experienced in the insurance industry of bps per year 
on november   standard poor s published global methodology for rating trust preferred hybrid securities revised 
this study lists a recovery assumption of 
prepayment speed annually  at maturity  based upon a preferred term security historical collateral redemption summary  updated since september  to reflect the slow down in pre payment speeds and the reluctance on the part of banks to release capital in the current market environment 
anticipated life to maturity is used because auction take out is currently considered unlikely 
libor rate is assumed to remain constant for all periods 
additional defaults and deferrals actual defaults that have been experienced in the pools and actual and announced deferrals have been incorporated into expected cash flows for each individual security 
discount rate the rate equal to the current yield used to accrete the beneficial interest as required in fasb asc paragraph management regularly performs an internal assessment of the specific banks and insurance company issuers underlying the securities to assess the likelihood of additional collateral being at risk beyond those issuers that have defaulted  deferred interest  or indicated a future deferral of interest 
publically available key performance ratios are reviewed with emphasis placed on the combination of third party ratings of financial strength and ratios such as the texas ratio and the modified texas ratio that relate concentrations and levels of non performing assets to capital 
favorable consideration is given to those banks who participated in the us government s cpp program on the strength of the review to enter that program 
the results of the internal assessment are factored into an analysis stressing the standard cash flow tests 
in accordance with fasb asc section  the present value of cash flow for the preferred term securities at december  was compared to the present value of the cash flows previously projected at september  the results showed that the present value of the current estimated cash flows were less than the present value of cash flows at the last reporting date for the following pretsl i mezzanine class  pretsl xvi class c  pretsl xvii class c  pretsl xxii class c  pretsl xxiii class d  pretsl xxiv class c  and the alesco a d 
as a result  management determined that we do not expect to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis and as such  they were deemed other than temporarily impaired at december  based on this calculation  a non cash credit loss in the amount of approximately million was recognized in earnings for this period 
management does not believe that this will have a material effect on our liquidity 
as the board and management focus on increasing capital levels  we have determined to change our intent with regard to two of our trust preferred positions 
both pretsl xv and pretsl xvii are pools in which the corporation issued underlying debentures  so we have disallowed capital for purposes of regulatory capital calculations to the extent we have outstanding debt in those pools 
as of december  the associated disallowance of capital was approximately million 
because of this disallowance of capital and the uncertainties that remain in our loan and investment portfolio  we have determined that we will more likely than not be required to sell the securities before recovering their cost basis 
the timing of that sale or disposal is uncertain at this time and is dependent upon our capital modeling 
according to topic fasb asc section  the impairment related to these securities is other than temporary and should be recognized currently in earnings in an amount equal to the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the non cash loss recorded on these two securities in the fourth quarter of amounted to approximately million 
management does not believe that this will have a material effect on our liquidity 
as of december   non cash other than temporary impairment charges were million 
during  management deemed five of the preferred term securities to be worthless 
these included pretsl xv class c  pretsl xxii class d  pretsl xxv class d  alesco a d  and sloso se a bl 
the full value of these securities has been recognized in earnings through december on october   as part of the us government s economic stabilization plan  the treasury announced two plans  the cpp and the tlgp 
the regulators highly encouraged participation in the programs in order to build capital levels  supply additional liquidity to the banking industry  and improve financial ratios for the large regional and national banks and the community banks 
a third program  the capital assistance program  was adopted during the first quarter of many of the banks who issued the trust preferred securities in our portfolio have announced participation in one or more of these programs 
management believes that these programs should help to bolster confidence in the industry and  eventually  provide capital and liquidity to the banking industry  but a long recovery is anticipated 
with the exception of pretsl xv and pretsl xvii as discussed above  management does not intend to sell the remaining preferred term securities nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery 
the risk based capital ratios require that banks set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade 
securities rated one level below investment grade require a risk weighting 
additional methods are applicable to securities rated more than one level below investment grade 
as of december   management believes that we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover the additional capital requirements of these securities and future operating expenses 
additionally  we do not anticipate any material commitments or expected outlays of capital in the near term 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio consists of agency backed bonds and private label collateralized mortgage obligations 
nine of the private label bonds with a fair value of million have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than months 
the unrealized loss on these securities is million 
all of the private label securities are monitored on a monthly basis to allow management to assess the overall exposure to various factors that could have an effect on the credit quality of the bonds 
factors such as loan to value ratio  credit support levels  credit scores  geographic concentration  prepayment speeds  delinquencies and coverage ratios are incorporated into this assessment 
all private label collateralized mortgage obligation bonds held in the portfolio were of the highest investment grade at the time of purchase 
however  seven of the nine private labels were downgraded below investment grade during for purposes of determining impairment status  management has determined that a coverage ratio of less than one could indicate potential shortfall of principal cash flow for the security 
accordingly  management performed cash flow analysis on all of the bonds with a coverage ratio of less than one 
a whole loan collateralized mortgage obligation credit stress analysis was run on each of the private label bonds with a coverage ratio less than one 
the stress analysis modeled the performance of our holdings based on varying constant default rates  constant prepayment rates and loss severities 
the first factor used to determine the appropriate assumptions for cash flow analysis was the resulting life cumulative default percentage needed to be at least equal to the current day plus delinquency percentage in the specific collateral 
either an intex cash flow model or a bloomberg super yield table was run using the constant prepayment rate  loss severity percentage  and constant default rate attributable to the projected cumulative default percentage of our bond based on its current level of performance 
the current book yield on each bond was used to determine the present value of the cash flows for each bond as of december  the current book value of each bond was compared to the present value per the cash flow model to determine any other than temporary impairment losses 
one private label collateralized mortgage obligation bond had a book value less than the current present value 
an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately 
million was recorded on this bond for the year ended december  we do not consider the remaining bonds to be other than temporarily impaired 
we manage our investment portfolio utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity  meet earnings objectives  and provide required collateral support for deposit activities and treasury management overnight investment products 
other than as indicated above  we do not intend to sell the impaired bonds in our portfolio nor do we believe we will be required to sell them prior to recovery of the impairment

this decrease in is due to having no overnight borrowings at december  and the repayment of a million long term fhlb advance during the year

total borrowings increased by million or in when compared to  while the average balance of borrowings increased by million during the same period

management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million  an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions  million of an unused secured line of credit with the frb and approximately million through wholesale money market funds 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios 
total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the receipt of million in cpp funds from the treasury in january offset by declines in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the return on average equity roe for decreased to from for as noted above  pursuant to the treasury s cpp  in january   the corporation sold  shares of series a preferred stock and a related warrant to purchase  shares of common stock for an exercise price of per share to the treasury for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the proceeds from this transaction count as tier capital and the warrant qualifies as tangible common equity 
information about the terms of these securities is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report

in december  the corporation reduced its quarterly dividend by to 
per share effective with the dividend payable on february  liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  we take advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable us to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   our available borrowing capacity through the fhlb and other financial institutions was approximately million 
in addition  we had approximately million available funding through brokered money market funds 
we actively manage our liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation s board of directors 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands  which could include future branch expansion 
in addition to on going liquidity management  we also maintain a liquidity contingency plan which stresses our liquidity position under potential adverse conditions 
this plan is updated monthly and enables management to foresee potential liquidity needs and to plan accordingly 
the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debentures 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid million in cash dividends on its common stock 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the corporation without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
during  we remained negatively gapped although our focus was shifted to begin moving to a more neutral position in anticipation of rising interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
as a part of managing interest rate risk  the corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the re pricing characteristics of certain interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  which have the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative  net of taxes  recorded in net accumulated other comprehensive income 
in july  the corporation entered into three interest rate swap contracts totaling million notional amount  hedging future cash flows associated with floating rate trust preferred debt 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was thousand 
the corporation had no open derivative positions at december  there was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded for the year ended december  interest rate swap agreements are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and the corporation believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of december  at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that we become slightly asset sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
when an organization is asset sensitive an increase in interest rates normally creates a positive impact to net interest income 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
further discussion of the nature of certain obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referenced in the table below  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
payments due by period contractual obligations in millions note reference total less than year years years more than years long term debt fhlb advances junior subordinated debt operating leases data processing and telecommunications services time deposits pension serp commitment expiration by period commitments in millions note reference total less than year years years more than years loan commitments letters of credit at december   our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to the loan commitments and letters of credit discussed above
