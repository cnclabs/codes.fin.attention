item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures in our financial statements 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates beginning at page our continuing operations are reported in two segments  rental and management and network development services 
management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments 
we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and accretion  selling  general  administrative and development expense  and other operating expense 
we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling  general  administrative and development expense attributable to the segment  excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses 
segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income  tv azteca  net see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
these measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income  interest expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  other income expense  noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries  income loss on equity method investments  income taxes and discontinued operations 
executive overview our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment  which accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and approximately of our segment operating profit for the years ended december  and the primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites  new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites  our existing tenant leases and related contractual escalations  leasing of additional space on our existing sites and the cancellation rate of our existing tenant leases 
we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing site capacity 
in addition  we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services 
as we continue to primarily focus on growing our rental and management business  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non cancelable term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
in addition  most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease 
these contractual escalations are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent  inflation  or a fixed percentage plus inflation 
revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement 
we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers  which increases the non cancelable term of the agreement and creates incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows 
the revenues generated by our rental and management segment may also be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters 
table of contents are multi year contracts  which typically may not be cancelled or  in some instances  may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee 
accordingly  lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment 
during the year ended december   tenant leases representing approximately of our rental and management revenues were cancelled 
during the year ended december   revenues generated by our rental and management segment increased million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated by our legacy sites which resulted from leasing additional space to new tenants  leasing additional space for the equipment of our existing tenants  as well as contractual tenant lease escalations 
to a lesser extent  a portion of our revenue growth was attributable to the  new sites that we acquired or constructed since january  the increase in revenue was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straight line revenue recognition 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and  to a lesser extent  the location of and available capacity on our existing sites 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs  the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites and expanding our site portfolio will contribute to the majority of our year over year revenue growth in our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate  selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense 
our segment level selling  general  administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments  such as sales and property management functions 
in general  our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our legacy sites and increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing additional space to new customers on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint  we may incur additional segment level selling  general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas 
our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities

as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the revolving credit facility and term loan 
as a result of these swap agreements  the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at december  for the revolving credit facility and term loan was 
for projections of our cash interest expense related to the revolving credit facility and term loan  we have assumed the libor rate before the margin  as defined in the loan agreement  is through its maturity on june  
table of contents our convertible notes matured on february  we used cash on hand to repay the full amount outstanding 
operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms  as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases  thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease 
pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement  we are obligated to acquire towers in brazil  pending regulatory approvals  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
if regulatory approvals are not obtained by june   the definitive purchase agreement expires  unless extended by mutual consent of the parties 
primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet  primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash 
other long term liabilities exclude million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
refinancing activities in order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness  lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility  we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
tender offer for and redemption of senior notes 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our notes pursuant to a cash tender offer 
we paid million  including approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest  to holders of the notes using net proceeds from the institutional private placement of the notes discussed above 
subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer  we completed the redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the notes  the remaining notes were redeemed at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  july   for an aggregate purchase price of million  including accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million 
upon completion of this redemption  none of the notes remained outstanding 
redemption of convertible notes 
during the year ended december   we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
in accordance with the conversion provisions and the indenture for the notes  holders of the notes had the right at any time up to and including  but not after the close of business on august   to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
holders of approximately million of the notes converted their notes into an aggregate of  shares of common stock prior to redemption 
in accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the notes  the remaining notes were redeemed at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  august   for an aggregate purchase price of million 
upon completion of this redemption  none of the notes remained outstanding 

table of contents redemption of senior notes 
during the year ended december   we issued a notice for the redemption of the principal amount of our outstanding notes 
in accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the notes  the notes were redeemed at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  november   for an aggregate purchase price of million  including approximately million of accrued and unpaid interest 
upon completion of this redemption  none of the notes remained outstanding 
interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we held interest rate swap agreements  all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  and which have an aggregate notional amount of million  interest rates ranging from to and expiration dates through march factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan 
the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
these include limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guaranties  sales of assets and liens 
the loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage  senior secured leverage and interest coverage  as set forth below 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda as defined in the loan agreement of to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda of to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
interest coverage ratio this ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   our interest expense  which was million for that period  could increase by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 

table of contents the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis  we would be in breach of these covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility  but would constitute a default  which could result in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization 
the loan agreement related to the securitization involved assets related to  broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the borrowers  through a private offering of billion of commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series the certificates 
the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations 
among other things  the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets 
the borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities  including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors 
the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets  promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization  and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers  including the right to conduct site investigations 
under the terms of the securitization loan agreement  the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization  which must be deposited  and thereafter distributed  solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan 
the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan 
on a monthly basis  all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments  to fund required reserves  to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan  referred to as excess cash flow  is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us 
during the year ended december   the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately million 
in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us  the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage dscr 
for this purpose  dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan 
pursuant to one such test  if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were x or less  during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the securitization in may  or x or less  thereafter  x or x as applicable  the cash trap dscr  then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

table of contents additionally  while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the securitization loan until april  excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an amortization period under the securitization loan until april an amortization period would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below x  during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the securitization in may  or x thereafter x or x as applicable  the minimum dscr 
in such a case  all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters  and so would not be available for distribution to us 
consequently  a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers 
additionally  a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us  which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures  including tower construction and acquisitions  and our stock repurchase program 
in addition  if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization  the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization  in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 
as of december   the borrowers dscr was x 
based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december  and the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan  the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr  and approximately million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 
as discussed above  we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program  we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities 
if we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital  we may be unable to do so  or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise  we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives  refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 
in addition  our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities 
as set forth under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and  consequently  a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
as also set forth in that item  as of december   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have primarily caused a subsidiary of grupo iusacell  which represented approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december   to suspend debt service payments on its us dollar denominated debt 
while grupo iusacell has continued to make partial payments to us  our net accounts receivable related to grupo iusacell was approximately million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related 
table of contents disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to impairment of assets  asset retirement obligations  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes  and estimated useful lives of assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  beginning on page f impairment of assets assets subject to depreciation and amortization and non core long lived assets held for sale we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment whenever events  changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 
we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment  which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues 
we monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment  such as high levels of turnover or attrition  non renewal of a significant number of contracts  or the cancellation or termination of a relationship 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset s fair market value  as compared to the asset s carrying value 
we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 
impairment of assets goodwill assets not subject to amortization we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our goodwill is recorded in our rental and management segment and tested for impairment annually as of december or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we utilize the two step traditional impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment 
when conducting this test  we employ a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis 
the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance  terminal sales growth rate  management s expectations of future operating results  the current weighted average cost of capital  and a current tax rate 
under the first step of this test  we compare the fair value  as calculated using future discounted cash flows  to the carrying value of the rental and management reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we conduct the second step of this test  in which the implied fair value of the rental and management reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
during the year ended december   no impairment was determined under the first step of the test 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none 
table of contents of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually  which we determined to be reasonable  would impact our conclusions a reduction in projected net income  a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital  and a reduction in terminal sales growth rate 
asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located  in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation  which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of million and million  respectively 
the increase in primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned  regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases 
straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date 
income taxes we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe  or if the applicable 
table of contents statute of limitations lapses 
we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to million 
as of december   we have classified approximately million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also classified approximately million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we periodically review our deferred tax assets  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards  equity investments and foreign items 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets  primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards  as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately billion and billion in federal and state taxable income  respectively  from january  to december  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above  we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  estimated useful lives of assets as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  we completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of based on this review  we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets  primarily its network location intangible assets  from our historical estimate of years to a revised estimate of years  effective january  we accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate which was accounted for prospectively effective january  for the year ended december   the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations 
we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments  namely interest rate swaps 
as of december   we held interest rate swap agreements  all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  and which have an aggregate notional amount of million  interest rates ranging from to and expiration dates through march in addition  in may  we entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of xcel 
this foreign currency exchange contract was not designated as a hedging instrument and was settled upon the completion of the acquisition of xcel on may  during the year ended december   we repurchased or redeemed approximately million face amount of our outstanding debt securities  including the repurchase and redemption of million principal amount of our notes  the redemption of million principal amount of our notes and the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of our notes
