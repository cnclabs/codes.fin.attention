overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc  san francisco and princeton  nj 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements  current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors 
from time to time  we also generate cash through the sale of assets 
the impact of the current state of the economy  including the high rate of unemployment  continues to adversely impact the fundamentals of our business  including overall market occupancy and rental rates 
our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants 
historically  this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and we believe this is proving to be true once again 

table of contents although leasing velocity has generally improved in our markets since the beginning of  particularly in new york city  the lack of meaningful job growth  the overall availability of space and the absence of meaningful new tenant expansion have negatively impacted lease economics 
rental rates have declined and transaction costs including tenant improvement allowances and free rent periods have increased 
while it is not clear how long these trends will persist  our experiences in past recessions suggest that we will not see unemployment peak and job growth begin until the later stages of a broad economic recovery 
we continue to believe that general office market conditions are dependent on the impact of a recovery in the labor markets 
because the individual labor and industry markets may recover at different paces  we may see varying degrees of strength or softness in our core markets 
throughout we have seen an increase in transaction velocity across all of our markets 
although overall supply has increased  demand has decreased and there has been negative absorption of available space 
we expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high quality space  such as ours 
overall  we expect our occupancy to remain relatively flat during given the volatility in the capital markets over the past months and the potential to acquire assets at attractive prices  we took steps to improve our liquidity and enhance our capital position 
since the beginning of we raised a total of billion from the following we raised million in two secured financings  in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  which raised approximately million of net proceeds  and in october  we completed a public offering of senior notes due that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we expect to repay approximately million of indebtedness and to refinance or extend approximately million of million of other debt that matures  which amount includes our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt 
as of february   we believe our combination of available cash of approximately billion and borrowing capacity on our unsecured line of credit of approximately billion is sufficient to meet all of our existing development funding obligations  repay near term financings and provide significant capital for future investments 
we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital 
in addition  we believe deteriorated market fundamentals  overleveraged real estate assets and existing property owners with insufficient capital resources will eventually provide opportunities for well capitalized companies and seasoned operators  such as us  to acquire high quality assets at attractive levels 
opportunities to acquire properties may come through outright property acquisitions  joint venture arrangements or through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt 
while transactional activity in the office sector has yet to accelerate  our management team is actively seeking opportunities 
we will maintain our disciplined investment strategy  which focuses on high quality assets in supply constrained markets  emphasizing long term value creation 
we believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service in  and however  we do not anticipate undertaking new development projects in the foreseeable future without significant pre leasing commitments from creditworthy tenants 
for descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during  see item business transactions during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is 
table of contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with guidance included in accounting standards codification asc business combinations asc formerly known as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r sfas r  and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such criteria are present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by guidance included in asc property  plant and equipment asc formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 

table of contents asc formerly known as sfas no 
 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
effective january   under the provisions of asc formerly known as sfas no 
r  we were required to expense costs associated with the acquisition of real property such as legal  due diligence and other closing related costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
after the determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins  and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in asc capitalization of interest and asc real estate general formerly known as sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed  occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction  or if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest  our representation in the entity s governance  the size of our investment including loans  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of 
table of contents net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other than temporary 
the ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
in accordance with the provisions of asc investments equity method and joint ventures asc formerly statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop  we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with guidance included in asc formerly known as sfas no 
r  we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases in accordance with asc formerly known as sfas no 
r 
for the year ended december   the impact of the straight line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately million 
these amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above and below market leases and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures  which are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  revenue  
table of contents cash flows  leverage and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral  in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of through a rating of represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded 
a rating of represents the lowest credit rating  in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space needs ie  expansion downsize  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received  then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc principal agent considerations asc formerly known as emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue 
asc requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with guidance in asc our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 

table of contents we receive management and development fees from third parties 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc real estate sales asc formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met  we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  leasing  profit sharing  deposit  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with guidance in asc formerly known as sfas no 
r  we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes its judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses  net income and equity 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from 
table of contents period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in properties acquired  sold  repositioned and placed in service 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties  inc  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests  losses gains from investments in securities  losses from early extinguishments of debt  net derivative losses  loss from suspension of development  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate and other assets  income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties  inc noi excludes certain components from net income attributable to boston properties  inc in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties  inc as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties  inc as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
for a reconciliation of noi to net income attributable to boston properties inc  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio 
the same property portfolio consists of properties  including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned through december   totaling approximately million net rentable square feet of space excluding square feet of structured parking 
the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service  acquired or repositioned after january  or disposed of on or prior to december  this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the year ended december  and with respect to the properties which were acquired  placed in service  repositioned or sold

table of contents rental revenue the increase of approximately million in total property portfolio rental revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our total property portfolio 
rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately million  properties sold decreased approximately million  properties acquired increased approximately million and properties placed in service increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to included in the same property portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately million and an increase of approximately million in straight line rents 
the increase in straight line rent is primarily the result of us establishing in the third quarter of a million reserve  which was reflected as a direct reduction of straight line rent  for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in new york city with lehman brothers  inc and the law firm of heller ehrman llp 
the increases in contractual rental revenue and straight line rent were offset by an approximately million decrease in recoveries from tenants in generally  under each of our leases  we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease 
the decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in new york city  which resulted in lesser tenant recoveries due to decreased occupancy and  to the extent space was re leased  leases are in their first year during which  generally  no tenant recoveries are earned 
we also had an approximately million decrease in parking and other income 
we expect straight line rents for the total property portfolio to contribute an aggregate of approximately million to million in fiscal compared to approximately million in revenue from properties sold decreased by approximately million due to the transfer of mountain view research park and mountain view technology park to the value added fund on january  these properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the value added fund 
the acquisition of massachusetts avenue on september  increased rental revenue from properties acquired by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue from properties placed in service relates to fully placing in service our th street development project in the first quarter of  our citypoint and south of market development projects during the fourth quarter of  our one preserve parkway and wisconsin place office development projects during the second quarter of  our democracy tower development project during the third quarter of and our carnegie center development project during the fourth quarter of the one preserve parkway development project had been partially placed in service during the second quarter of rental revenue from properties placed in service increased approximately million  as detailed below property quarter placed in service rental revenue for the year ended december change in thousands th street first quarter     south of market fourth quarter     citypoint fourth quarter     one preserve parkway second quarter    wisconsin place office second quarter    democracy tower third quarter    carnegie center fourth quarter    total 
table of contents termination income we recognized termination income totaling approximately million for the year ended december   which was related to multiple tenants across the total property portfolio that terminated their leases 
approximately million of termination income for related to a termination agreement with a tenant at lexington avenue 
approximately million of the total termination income for is non cash and consists of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases 
termination income totaling approximately million for the year ended december  was related to multiple tenants across the total property portfolio that terminated their leases  including million of termination income related to a termination agreement with heller ehrman  llp 
real estate operating expenses the million increase in property operating expenses real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance  cleaning and other property related expenses in the total property portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our total property portfolio 
operating expenses for the same property portfolio increased approximately million  properties acquired increased approximately million  properties placed in service increased approximately million and properties sold decreased approximately  operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to included in same property portfolio operating expenses is an increase in real estate taxes of approximately million  or  which was predominately due to an increase in real estate taxes in the central business districts in boston and new york city

table of contents on january   our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the plan to our officers and employees 
these opp awards are part of a broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure 
opp awards utilize total return to shareholders trs over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period subject to acceleration in certain events as a retention tool 
recipients of opp awards will share in an outperformance pool if our trs  including both share appreciation and dividends  exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from february  to february   based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of for the five trading days prior to and including february  the aggregate reward that recipients of all opp awards can earn  as measured by the outperformance pool  is subject to a maximum cap of million  although opp awards for an aggregate of up to approximately million have been allocated to date and were granted on february  the balance remains available for future grants

r share based payment the opp awards have an aggregate value of approximately million  which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period 
because the opp units require us to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds  unless such thresholds have been met by the end of the applicable reporting period  we exclude the opp units from the diluted eps calculation

in december  the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors  investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor 
as a result  we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended  and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions 
because interests in this fund were valued at less than their par value  we recognized losses gains of approximately million and million on our investment during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund

under this deferred compensation plan  each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer 
in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan  we typically acquire  in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use  similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer 
this enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service and principal repayment obligations  including balloon payments on maturing debt  fund capital expenditures  including major renovations  tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund development costs  fund possible property acquisitions  and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness  cash flow from operations  distribution of cash flows from joint ventures  cash and cash equivalent balances  sales of real estate  issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our operating partnership  and our unsecured line of credit or other short term bridge facilities 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand  cash flows generated by operations  availability under our unsecured line of credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities  to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs 
we generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans  which may be guaranteed 
however  the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors  including  among others  the project s size and duration and our access to cost effective capital at the given time

contractual rental revenue  recoveries from tenants  other income from operations  available cash balances and draws on our unsecured line of credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
we believe our revenue  together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes 
our capital strategy is to maintain access to multiple sources of capital including secured debt  unsecured debt  and public and private equity such that turmoil in one or more of these sources does not eliminate our access to capital 
consistent with this strategy  in april we obtained a construction loan facility totaling million none of which has been drawn to date collateralized by our atlantic wharf development to fund development costs  in june  we issued  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  in july  we refinanced our reservoir place property with million of secured debt  and in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these transactions bolstered our liquidity position and  with cash balances as of february  of approximately billion and borrowing capacity on our unsecured credit facility of approximately billion  we are well positioned to meet all of our current development funding obligations  repay near term debt maturities and make new opportunistic investments 
four assets held by our unconsolidated joint ventures have aggregate debt maturities in of approximately million of which our share is approximately million 
we expect to refinance these loans with secured debt and anticipate that aggregate proceeds will be sufficient to repay the aggregate existing debts 
we and our unconsolidated joint ventures also have an aggregate of approximately million of which our share is approximately million of construction loans maturing in subject to satisfying certain conditions  we have the right  and intend  to extend these facilities 
in addition  we expect to repay an aggregate of approximately million of secured debt on three assets in our carnegie center portfolio and one building in cambridge  ma  upon maturity in our unsecured line of credit expires in august and contains a one year extension at our option provided that we are not in default 
we currently expect that we will exercise this option and extend the maturity date to august our remaining capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program 

table of contents in addition to our unsecured line of credit and property specific debt  as of february  we also had approximately billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding including approximately billion of exchangeable notes 
all of this debt either matures or is redeemable between and in order to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption  we may  from time to time  purchase unsecured senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions  or both 
we will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then existing market conditions  taking into account the trading prices of the notes  our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital 
in total  our remaining capital requirements  net of anticipated funding from existing construction loans  to complete our ongoing developments is approximately million  through the end of  which includes approximately million of costs related to one preserve parkway which was fully placed in service during the second quarter of with available cash proceeds  access to our unsecured line of credit and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio  we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements and pursue attractive investment opportunities 
finally  in prior years  we have been an active seller of real estate assets and  although we will consider additional asset sales  we do not expect any material asset sales in the near future 
reit tax distribution considerations dividend as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of our annual taxable income 
our policy is to distribute at least of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax 
with a view toward increasing our equity over time and preserving additional capital  we reduced our quarterly dividend in the second quarter of to per common share 
based on our current expectation for taxable income over the next few years  and absent any unanticipated circumstances  we expect that our quarterly dividend will be approximately per common share for the next several quarters 
there can be no assurance that the actual dividends declared by our board of directors will not differ materially 
sales to the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions  we would  at the appropriate time  decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend  adopt a stock repurchase program  reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities 
such a decision will depend on many factors including  among others  the timing  availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities  our then current and anticipated leverage  the cost and availability of capital from other sources  the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements 
at a minimum  we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales
