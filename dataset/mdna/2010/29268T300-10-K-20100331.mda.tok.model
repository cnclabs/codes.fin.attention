item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  we engaged in the design  development  manufacturing  marketing  and installation of energy efficient lighting systems where the company served two principal markets commercial industrial lighting and pool lighting 
we completed the initial phase of our new business strategy to provide turnkey  comprehensive energy efficient lighting solutions  which use  but are not limited to  our patented and proprietary technology 
our solutions include light emitting diode led  ceramic metal halide cmh  fiber optic efo  high intensity discharge hid  and other highly energy efficient lighting technologies 
typical savings related to our technology approximates in electricity costs  while providing full spectrum light closely simulating daylight colors 
our strategy also incorporates continued investment into the research of new and emerging energy sources including  but not limited to  solar energy 
during  we made major progress in completing a restructuring plan focused on repositioning the company for growth and profitability 
this plan involves four major areas of focus which include dramatic reduction of unabsorbed manufacturing and fixed overhead costs 
divesting of our non strategic business units 
in december  we announced the sale of our german subsidiary  lbm lichtleit fasertechnik lbm 
we are currently investigating potential opportunities to divest one or more of our remaining legacy businesses 
leveraging our fundamental intellectual property and government research to create extremely energy efficient illumination products for existing buildings 
the company is currently developing an intelligent led lamp to replace linear fluorescent lamps for general illumination 
the led replacement lamp is designed to reduce energy consumption by more than while delivering superior lighting qualities 
establishing a national sales and delivery vehicle into the existing building market through the acquisition of lighting retrofit companies 
on december   we completed the acquisition of stones river companies  llc src 
src is a well established lighting retrofit company that services primarily the southeastern region of the united states 
we anticipate growth through expansion of src s geographical coverage and  possibly  through one or more subsequent acquisitions across the united states 
our development of solar technology is continuing through our leadership role in the united states government s very high efficiency solar cell vhesc consortium sponsored by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa 
the goal of the vhesc project is to develop a or greater efficient solar cell for united states military applications  which would also be available to the public for commercial application 
on september   we announced that we entered into a  contract with the vhesc consortium to deliver advanced solar research to enable high efficiency  low cost photovoltaics 
on october   we announced that we entered into a  twelve month contract with the vhesc consortium to deliver advanced solar research to achieve low cost efficient spectrum splitting 
in march   the department of defense selected energy focus to receive a phase i small business innovative research sbir grant to begin the development of a solid state infrared replacement for the m flare for the united states army s hydra rocket system 
in july   the naval research warfare center awarded us a  contract to develop and produce solid state lighting fixtures for use on virginia class attack submarines 
in august   darpa awarded us a  sbir extension grant to develop and produce solid state lighting fixtures for general use on united states navy ships 
also in september  we entered into a  agreement with the department of energy for a phase i sbir project to investigate methods of using coatings to improve color consistency for metal halide lamps 
results of operations cash utilization cash utilization was  for the twelve months ended december   excluding  of cash proceeds received from the issuance of rights to purchase common stock and  of net cash disbursements related to the acquisition of src and related bonding securitization

net sales our sales breakdowns  by product lines  with efo products as a separate line item  are as follows in thousands year ending december  efo traditional pool traditional commercial lighting total net sales net sales from continuing operations decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  the decline was primarily a result of a  decrease in efo product net sales  a decrease of  in traditional pool lighting sales  and a decrease of  in net sales by our united kingdom subsidiary 
during   of net sales was recognized from the delivery of certain milestones to ei dupont de nemours and company as part of the vhesc consortium being funded by darpa 
net sales were significantly depressed from prior year levels due to the on going global economic and financial crisis 
our net sales were particularly adversely impacted by significant reductions in residential and new construction against which our pool and commercial markets are closely aligned 
net sales from continuing operations increased to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  in this slight growth was a result of an increase of  in efo and traditional commercial lighting net sales offset by decreased traditional pool lighting net sales of  the decrease in traditional pool lighting net sales was due primarily to a decrease in net sales from our in ground and jazz lighting products 
the decrease in traditional commercial lighting net sales was due to lower net sales in the united states and germany 
international sales we have a foreign manufacturing operation in the united kingdom  and net sales and expenses from these operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
fluctuations in this operation s respective currency may have an impact on our business  results of operations  and financial position 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our international operations 
as a result  we may experience substantial foreign currency translation gains or losses due to the volatility of other currencies compared to the united states dollar  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these operations 
for continuing operations  international net sales accounted for approximately of net sales in  as compared to for  and for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a reduction in reported net sales for of  from levels as compared to a decrease in reported net sales for of  from levels 
on a local currency basis  net sales decreased for our united kingdom operation from levels

through september   we maintained two manufacturing and assembly facilities for our north american operations which resulted in overall lower gross profitability on a net sales per dollar basis 
in a continuing effort to reduce the fixed overhead of the company  and in conjunction with the strategic transition  into a turnkey energy efficient lighting services solutions company  we relocated of the north american manufacturing and assembly operation into our lower cost mexican contract manufacturing facility 
furthermore  we eliminated our solon  ohio distribution services operation in the first quarter of lastly  we are currently in discussions with our solon facility landlord to develop a mutually beneficial early termination of our lease agreement in that facility 
in  we had gross profit of  compared to  in as a percentage of sales  the gross profit for  was compared to in included in the gross profit is total expense in the amount of  related to our modification of the definition of slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  although management believes that we have addressed many of the legacy issues that have historically burdened our financial performance  we still face challenges in order to reach profitability 
in order for us to attain profitability and growth  we will need to successfully address these challenges  including the continuation of cost reductions throughout our organization  execution of our marketing and sales plans for our new turnkey energy efficient lighting solutions business  continued evaluation and divestiture of non core business product lines  and continued improvements in our supply chain performance 
our independent public accounting firm has issued an opinion in our annual report on form k raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
this opinion stems from our historically poor operating performance  the on going global economic crisis  and our historical inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet obligations and sustain operations without obtaining additional external financing 
although we are optimistic about obtaining the funding necessary for us to continue as a going concern  there can be no assurances that this objective will be successful 
we are currently aggressively pursuing the following external funding sources obtain financing and or grants available through federal  state  and or local governmental agencies  obtain financing from various financial institutions  obtain financing from non traditional investment capital organizations  potential sale or divestiture of one or more operating units  and obtain funding from the sale of our common stock or other equity instruments 
obtaining financing through the above mentioned mechanisms contains risks  including government stimulus and or grant money is not allocated to us despite our focus on the design  development  and manufacturing of energy efficient lighting systems  loans or other debt instruments may have terms and or conditions  such as interest rate  restrictive covenants  and control or revocation provisions  which are not acceptable to management or our board of directors  the current global economic crisis combined with our current financial condition may prevent us from being able to obtain any debt financing  financing may not be available for parties interested in pursuing the acquisition of one or more of our operating units  and additional equity financing may not be available to us in the current economic environment and could lead to further dilution of shareholder value for current shareholders of record 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies  and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses in the financial statements 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of net sales and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were utilized 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  long lived assets  valuation of inventories  accounting for income taxes  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable  has been earned  and when all of the following has occurred persuasive evidence or an arrangement exists  eg  a sales order  a purchase order  or a sales agreement  shipment has occurred  with the standard shipping term being fob ship point  or services provided on a proportional performance basis or installation have been completed  price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from our products based business are generally recognized upon shipping based upon the following all sales made by the company to its customer base are non contingent  meaning that they are not tied to that customer s resale of products  standard terms of sale contain shipping terms of fob ship point  meaning that title is transferred when shipping occurs  and there are no automatic return provisions that allow the customer to return the product in the event that the product does not sell within a defined timeframe 
revenues from our products based business that incorporate specifically defined installation services have historically been recognized as follows product sale at completion of installation  and installation service at completion of installation 
for  revenues from our lighting solutions based business will generally be larger contracts and may range from three to eighteen months in duration 
furthermore  these contracts generally contain multiple deliverables which entitle us to record revenue associated with each element of these contracts based upon that individual element s fair value or percentage of completion basis based upon the percentage of costs incurred 
fair value is generally defined as the price charged for that element that has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
the elements of a multiple deliverables contract which would have value on a stand alone basis include comprehensive site assessment  which includes a review of the current lighting requirements and energy usage at the customer s facility  site field verification  where we perform a test implementation of our energy management system at a customer s facility upon request  utility incentive and government subsidy management  where we assist our customers in identifying  applying for and obtaining available utility incentives or government subsidies  engineering design  which involves designing a customized system to suit our customer s facility lighting and energy management needs  and providing the customer with a written analysis of the potential energy savings and lighting and environmental benefits associated with the designed system  project management  which involves our working with the electrical contractor in overseeing and managing all phases of implementation from delivery through installation for a single facility or through multi facility roll outs tied to a defined project schedule  installation services  which we provide through our national network of qualified third party installers  and recycling in connection with our retrofit installations  where we remove  dispose of and recycle our customer s legacy lighting fixtures 
we warrant our products against defects or workmanship issues 
we set up allowances for estimated returns  discounts  and warranties upon recognition of revenue and these allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated returns  discounts  and warranty expenses 
these allowances are based on past history and historical trends  current economic conditions  and contractual terms 
our distributor s obligation to us is not contingent upon the resale of our products and as such does not prohibit revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns  and discounts we establish allowance for doubtful accounts and returns for probable losses  based on past history  current economic conditions  and contractual terms 
the specific components are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable  and allowance for sales returns 
in  the total allowance was  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales returns 
in  the total allowance had a balance of  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales returns 
we review these allowance accounts periodically and adjust them accordingly for current conditions 
long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves a two step process 
the first step is to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
there are several valuation methods for estimating a reporting unit s fair value  including market quotations and discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  a second step is performed 
under the second step  the identifiable assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss 
a significant amount of judgment is required in estimating fair value of the reporting unit and performing these tests 
as a result of our testing  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of  which represented the entire carrying value of goodwill at december  of this amount   relates to continuing operations 
as of december   we had  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated financial statements related to the december  acquisition of src 
we engaged an independent third party expert to assist in the allocation of the excess purchase price to the various specific separately identifiable intangible assets  including goodwill 
valuation of inventories we state inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
during   and  we charged   and  respectively  to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventories 
included in is total expense in the amount of  related to our modification of the definition of slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve 
management deems this increase appropriate as technology developments within the lighting industry continues to accelerate 
adjustments to our estimates  such as forecasted sales and expected product lifecycles  could harm our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then must assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not certain or is unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united states and germany  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based upon our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
share based payments in december  the fasb issued asc number  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
we have applied asc using the modified prospective method 
under this method  we are required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
in march   the sec released staff accounting bulletin no
