and for same period in during  the company s asset quality declined primarily as a result of the effects of the economic downturn affecting the united states as a whole and the local markets in which we operate 
the company acted to recognize probable losses in the loan portfolio and is attempting to resolve these loans quickly through foreclosure and sale of collateral
