restructuring on october   the company s board approved the purchase of the assets of the yarn division of dillon 
this approval was based on a business plan which assumed certain significant synergies that were expected to be realized from the elimination of redundant overhead  the rationalization of under utilized assets and certain other product optimization 
the preliminary asset rationalization plan included exiting two of the three production activities that were operating at the dillon facility and moving them to other unifi manufacturing facilities 
the plan was to be finalized once operations personnel from the company would have full access to the dillon facility  in order to determine the optimal asset plan for the company s anticipated product mix

on january   the company completed the dillon asset acquisition 
concurrent with the acquisition the company entered into a sales and services agreement the agreement 
the agreement covered the services of certain dillon personnel who were responsible for product sales and certain other personnel that were primarily focused on the planning and operations at the dillon facility 
the services would be provided over a period of two years at a fixed cost of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company finalized its plan and announced its decision to exit its recently acquired dillon polyester facility 
the closure of the dillon facility triggered an evaluation of the company s obligations arising under the agreement 
the company determined from this evaluation that the fair value of the services to be received under the agreement were significantly lower than the obligation to dillon 
as a result  the company determined that a portion of the obligation 
table of contents should be considered an unfavorable contract 
the company concluded that costs totaling approximately million relating to services provided under the agreement were for the ongoing benefit of the combined business and therefore should be reflected as an expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations  as incurred 
the remaining agreement costs totaling million were for the personnel involved in the planning and operations of the dillon facility and related to the time period after shutdown in june therefore  these costs were reflected as an assumed purchase liability since these costs no longer related to the generation of revenue and had no future economic benefit to the combined business

joint ventures and other equity investments yufi 
in august  the company formed yufi  a joint venture with ycfc  to manufacture  process and market polyester filament yarn in ycfc s facilities in yizheng  jiangsu province  china 
during fiscal year  the company s management explored strategic options with its joint venture partner in china with the ultimate goal of determining if there was a viable path to profitability for yufi 
management concluded that although yufi had successfully grown its position in high value and pva products  commodity sales would continue to be a large and unprofitable portion of the joint venture s business  due to cost constraints 
in addition  the company believed yufi had focused too much attention and energy on non value added issues  distracting management from its primary pva objectives 
based on these conclusions  the company decided to exit the joint venture and on july   the company announced that it had reached a proposed agreement to sell its interest in yufi to its partner for million 
as a result of the agreement with ycfc  the company initiated a review of the carrying value of its investment in yufi and determined that the carrying value of its investment in yufi exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents the company expected to close the transaction in the second quarter of fiscal year pending negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and chinese regulatory approvals 
the agreement provided for ycfc to immediately take over operating control of yufi  regardless of the timing of the final approvals and closure of the equity sale transaction 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company gave up one of its senior staff appointees and ycfc appointed its own designee as general manager of yufi  who assumed full responsibility for the operating activities of yufi at that time 
as a result  the company lost its ability to influence the operations of yufi and therefore the company switched from the equity method of accounting for its investment in the joint venture to the cost method and consequently ceased recording its share of losses commencing in the same quarter 
the company recognized equity losses of million for fiscal year in december  the company renegotiated the proposed agreement to sell its interest in yufi to ycfc for million and recorded an additional impairment charge of million  which included million related to certain disputed accounts receivable and million related to the fair value of its investment  as determined by the re negotiated equity interest sales price which was lower than carrying value

asc amends and clarifies asc which requires that the acquisition method of accounting  instead of the purchase method  be applied to all business combinations and that an acquirer is identified in the process 
the guidance requires that fair market value be used to recognize assets and assumed liabilities instead of the cost allocation method where the costs of an acquisition are allocated to individual assets based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill would be calculated as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the 
table of contents assets acquired  however  negative goodwill will be recognized immediately as a gain instead of being allocated to individual assets acquired

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those involving accounting estimates that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time and where different reasonable estimates or changes in the accounting estimate from quarter to quarter could materially impact the presentation of the financial statements 
the following discussion provides further information about accounting policies critical to the company and should be read in conjunction with footnote significant accounting policies and financial statement information of its audited historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for losses is provided for known and potential losses arising from yarn quality claims and for amounts owed by customers 
reserves for yarn quality claims are based on historical claim experience and known pending claims 
the collectability of accounts receivable is based on a combination of factors including the aging of accounts receivable  historical write off experience  present economic conditions such as customer bankruptcy filings within the industry and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
since losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  and the health of the textile industry  a significant level of judgment is required to arrive at the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts are written off when they are no longer deemed to be collectible 
the reserve for bad debts is established based on certain percentages applied to accounts receivable aged for certain periods of time and are supplemented by specific reserves for certain customer accounts where collection is no longer certain 
the company s exposure to losses as of june  on accounts receivable was million against which an allowance for losses and claims of million was provided 
the company s exposure to losses as of june  on accounts receivable was million against which an allowance for losses and claims of million was provided 
establishing reserves for yarn claims and bad debts requires management judgment and estimates  which may impact the ending accounts receivable valuation  gross margins for yarn claims and the provision for bad debts 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions it uses to assess allowance for losses 
certain unforeseen events  which the company considers to be remote  such as a customer bankruptcy filing  could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its accounts receivable loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged accounts receivable reserve percentages would not be material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
inventory reserves 
inventory reserves are established based on percentage markdowns applied to inventories aged for certain time periods 
specific reserves are established based on a determination of the obsolescence of the inventory and whether the inventory value exceeds amounts to be recovered through expected sales prices  less selling costs 
estimating sales prices  establishing markdown percentages and evaluating the condition of the inventories require judgments and estimates  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margins 
the company uses current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of its markdown percentages and expected sales prices 
the company believes it is unlikely that differences in actual demand or selling prices from those projected by management would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged inventory markdown percentages would not be material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  an impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
in such cases  additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of loss to be recognized 
the impairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value measured by future discounted cash flows 
the analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and  where applicable  judgments associated with  among other factors  the appropriate discount rate 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of an asset s 
table of contents carrying value is based on several factors including  but not limited to  a decline in operating cash flows or a decision to close a manufacturing facility 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and general economic conditions  therefore  the company s accounting estimates may change from period to period 
these factors could cause the company to conclude that a potential impairment exists and the related impairment tests could result in a write down of the long lived assets 
to the extent the forecasted operating results of the long lived assets are achieved and the company maintains its assets in good condition  the company believes that it is unlikely that future assessments of recoverability would result in impairment charges that are material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used to perform impairment testing during the past three fiscal years 
a decline in the company s forecasted cash flows would not have resulted in a failure of the undiscounted cash flow test 
for assets held for sale  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
estimates are required to determine the fair value  the disposal costs and the time period to dispose of the assets 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
actual cash flows received or paid could differ from those used in estimating the impairment loss  which would impact the impairment charge ultimately recognized and the company s cash flows 
the company engages independent appraisers in the determination of the fair value of any significant assets held for sale 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  at this time  management expects to continue to utilize the present estimation processes 
in fiscal years   and  the company performed impairment testing which resulted in the write down of polyester pp e of million  million  and million  respectively 
impairment of joint venture investments 
the company evaluates the ability of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates to sustain sufficient earnings to justify its carrying value and any reductions below carrying value that are not temporary are assessed for impairment purposes 
the company evaluates its equity investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company determined there were no other than temporary impairments related to the carrying value of its investments 
accruals for costs related to severance of employees and related health care costs 
from time to time  the company establishes accruals associated with employee severance or other cost reduction initiatives 
such accruals require that estimates be made about the future payout of various costs  including  for example  health care claims 
the company uses historical claims data and other available information about expected future health care costs to estimate its projected liability 
such costs are subject to change due to a number of factors  including the incidence rate for health care claims  prevailing health care costs and the nature of the claims submitted  among others 
consequently  actual expenses could differ from those expected at the time the provision was estimated  which may impact the valuation of accrued liabilities and results of operations 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  at this time management expects to continue to utilize the present estimation processes 
a plus or minus change in its estimated claims assumption would not be material to the company s financial statements 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its severance and related health care cost accruals during the past three fiscal years 
management and the company s audit committee discussed the development  selection and disclosure of all of the critical accounting estimates described above
