introduction we are a leading provider of government business market information products and planning tools that focus on federal  state  local and educational purchasing entities  and on early stage commercial and residential infrastructure projects 
contributing to our success is the growth of this government business market  or gbusiness market 
government is more involved in business than ever before through spending  legislation  regulation  and public private partnerships  and has taken on a giant role in the us economy over the past year  penetrating further into the private sector than any time since the s 
our gbusiness information and research tools help clients better understand this growing marketplace by providing insight into what government agencies plan to purchase  what they actually purchase  and who they purchase from 
historically  comprehensive market intelligence was only available to large companies with the resources to perform the research and store the data themselves  or companies that could afford to hire outside firms to perform the research for them 
our unique processes  which collect and organize transactional information into actionable market intelligence  have enabled us to make the same high value sales intelligence affordable to businesses of all sizes 
we believe our business solutions provide our clients with a distinct competitive advantage 
our information products and research tools leverage our proprietary database  which has been compiled over the last ten years  and includes comprehensive  historical and real time information on public and private infrastructure activities unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace 
our database provides information on approximately million procurement related records connected to over  companies from across approximately  government agencies and purchasing offices nationwide 
thousands of records are added to our database each day 
information in our database has been collected  formatted and classified by an in house team of researchers and third party providers so clients are able to quickly find and analyze information relevant to their businesses 
most of our revenues are currently generated from three main business channels subscriptions  content licenses  and management reports 
subscription based services are typically prepaid  have a minimum term of one year and revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
subscriptions are priced based upon the geographic range  nature of content purchased and  with respect to certain products  the number of users or number of records purchased 
revenue from content licenses is generated from clients who resell our business content data to their customers 
content license contracts are generally multi year arrangements that are invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis  and these agreements typically have a higher annual contract value  or acv  than our subscription based services 
acv represents the aggregate annual contract value of our client base 
revenue from content license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from the sale of management information reports is recognized upon delivery of the report to the client  or  if report refreshes are included  ratably over the service period 
pricing for management information reports is generally based on one  or a combination of  the following the number of records included in the report  the geographic range of the report  or a flat fee based on the type of report 
we also generate revenue from document download services and list rental services  and these fees are recognized upon delivery of the document or list 
management overview revenues for were million  representing an increase of over revenue for the fourth quarter of increased compared to the fourth quarter of the improvement in revenue was due primarily to growth in acv 
acv represents the aggregate annual revenue value of the company s subscription contracts 
acv increased to million at december  from million at december  acv increased as a result of increased adoption of our database product and planned price increases for renewing clients that are currently below our established list prices 
the other significant driver of acv is annual contract value per client  or acvc  which grew to  up compared to the fourth quarter of acvc improved in  in part by targeting higher value clients and emphasizing higher value database products 
approximately of our clients at december  subscribed to our higher value database products  an increase of from in the same year ago period 
annual net loss was  for  compared to a net loss of million for the improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue discussed above  which more than offset the increases in cost of revenue and operating expenses during the year 
cost of revenue increased as a result of an increase in the amount of new content we are capturing and the increases in operating expenses are discussed in more detail in the consolidated results of operations section below 
at december   we had  clients  a decrease of compared to  at december  we experienced lower retention rates toward the end of  and we believe this slowing is attributable  in part  to clients new to the public sector who underestimated the commitment required to successfully bid on government contracts  and the challenges faced by small businesses in the current economic climate 
recognizing these factors  our plans include the launch of new products and an increasing focus on large corporate enterprises 
in we invested million in internal and offshore development resources and capital expenditures to develop and implement new products and technologies 
during the fourth quarter we launched our new application and database platform 
the new platform creates a flexible and scalable product development environment  improves our database search and indexing capabilities  and enhances the user experience and usability of our information services 
the new search and indexing capabilities will dramatically improve the relevance of our information to the specific needs of our clients 
the new user interface has an entirely different look and feel  and integrates the commercial and government products into one robust database  which provides the opportunity to analyze a full set of data 
the new platform is expected to serve as the basis for product development and growth in the coming years 
in addition  we launched a new content management system  or cms  in february our new cms was developed to effectively capture new types of valuable content  to improve the productivity of our research organization  to improve data accuracy  and ultimately improve client retention 
we expect capital investments to be consistent with during as we continue to develop new products and tools to create a significant competitive advantage for onvia well into the future 
application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significan t unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from subscriptions  content licenses and management reports 
our subscriptions are generally annual contracts  however  we also offer  on a limited basis  extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients  and content licenses are generally multi year agreements 
subscription and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and list rental services  and revenue from these types of services is recognized upon delivery  or  if report refreshes are included  ratably over the service period 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of accounting standard codification  or asc  revenue recognition previously emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  we allocate revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management reports based on their relative fair values  which are consistent with established list prices for those offerings 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions from our non enterprise clients whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date  as well as the invoiced portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software previously statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on th e nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during  and  we abandoned   and  respectively  related to internal use software 
the abandoned assets relate to internal use code that was initially developed to enhance the functionality of existing products and internal workflow 
we no longer believe that the code will be compatible with our new technology platform and we believe these costs have no future value 
the   and  in abandonments represent the full unamortized value of these assets and is included in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the years ended decemb er   and  respectively 
non cash stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation previously sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of our stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our curren t estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced or earned but not invoiced portion of our enterprise contracts and content licenses once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable pursuant to the contract terms 
we do not record a receivable for the unbilled and unearned portion of our enterprise contracts or content licenses 
as of december  and  the unbilled portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses was approximately million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
contractual obligations future required payments under contracts  excluding operating expenses for our lease obligations  as of december  are as follows for the periods specified payments due by period total less than year years years more than years real estate operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital lease obligations other operating lease obligations total purchase obligations relate to software development and license agreements  co location hosting arrangements  telecom agreements  marketing agreements and third party content agreements 
capital lease obligations relate to server equipment and related maintenance agreements 
other operating lease obligations relate to office equipment leases 
consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses idle lease accrual total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss income comparison of years ended december   and revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenue growth was driven by an increase in new client acquisition as a result of activities stemming from the passage of the recovery act  and due to increased interest in public sector opportunities from the stalled commercial sector 
we experienced some erosion in renewal rates in the fourth quarter of  which we believe is attributable to clients new to the public sector who underestimated the commitment required to successfully bid on government contracts  as well as the challenges small businesses continue to face in the current economy 
we plan to implement a more rigorous account management plan to better serve our clients and we expect this to improve retention rat es 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in bookings growth in the fourth quarter of and the first half of resulting from a smaller acquisition sales force and lack of any significant new product introductions 
in the second half of  the economic stimulus activity  the passage of recovery legislation  and the stalled commercial sector increased interest in public sector opportunities and revenue growth accelerated in the latter half of cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our cost of revenue consists primarily of employee costs associated with collecting  categorizing and publishing our content  and also includes third party content fees and credit card processing fees 
the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase of  in third party content costs related to increased content collection and an increase of  in credit card fees as a result of increased bookings during these increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll related costs because of a decline in weighted average headcount on our content team 
weighted average headcount on our content team was during  compared to during for the year ended december   cost of revenue increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue was due primarily to an increase of  in third party content costs for new content collection associated with private sector information 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an aggregate increase of million  or 
employee costs increased by  due to an increase in weighted average headcount on our sales and marketing teams to during  compared to during allocated expenses were  higher in because of an increase in amortization of capitalized internal use software costs due to the launch of our new technology platform  and an increase in headcount on our sales and marketing teams 
employee costs consist of payroll  benefits and travel related expenses 
allocated expenses consist of depreciation and amortization and other facilities related expenses and are allocated based on headcount in the respective departments 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and employee costs increased by million due to an increase in weighted average headcount on our sales and marketing teams to during  compared to during allocated expenses were  higher in because of accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements as a result of our office relocation 
these increases were offset by a decrease of  in stock compensation because of forfeitures and a decrease of  in recruiting fees 
technology and development technology and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of million in employee costs as a result of a decrease in weighted average headcount on our technology and development teams to in  compared to in we have been able to decrease headcount on our technology and development team by leveraging offshore development resources 
the majority of the cost of these offshore resources is capitalized because they are focused almost exclusively on development efforts for new internal use software 
in addition  allocated costs decreased  because of the decrease in weighted average headcount 
these decrea ses were offset by an increase of  in contract labor for the non capitalizable portion of our offshore technology team and capitalization of internal onshore development costs decreased  because of the decrease in weighted average headcount 
technology and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of  in allocated costs and  in recruiting fees 
these decreases were offset by increases of  in employee costs and  in co location expenses 
in addition   more of internal onshore development costs were capitalized in because of the development of our new technology platform 
weighted average headcount on our technology and development teams decreased to in  compared to in  but employee costs increased mostly due to a  increase in bonus incentives related to new product development milestones 
the increase in al located expenses was due to amortization of new software and maintenance agreements to maintain our systems and to develop our new technology platform 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
although total expenses were flat compared to the prior year  we had the following fluctuations in expenses compared to travel and consulting expenses increased  as a result of our efforts to gather information on government s stimulus activities and the recovery act to assist with information requirements for our recovery 
org website 
bad debt expense increased  as a result of the current difficult economic conditions  which have been particularly challenging for small businesses 
we are now being more stringent with our practices of extending terms to clients to address this increase in bad debts 
allocated expenses increased  due to an overall increase in amortization as discussed above 
these increases were offset by decreases of  in business taxes   in non cash stock based compensation   in recruiting expenses   in office relocation expenses  and  in asset abandonment expenses 
business taxes were higher in because of a sales tax assessment for past due sales taxes in the state of texas 
stock compensation was lower in because the majority of outstanding options for our ceo became fully vested during the year 
recruiting fees were higher in primarily due to fees associated with the hire of our former vice president of marketing 
office relocation expenses were lower because we did not incur any of these expenses during finally  asset abandonment expenses were lower because we didn t have any significant abandonments during general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily associated with the following business taxes increased by  as discussed above  recruiting fees increased by  as discussed above  employee costs increased  primarily due to accrued severance for our former vice president of human resources  office relocation fees were  higher than as a result of our move to a new corporate headquarters building in january  and finally  we experienced increases of  and  in bad debt expense and expense for abandoned assets  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense was attributable to the weakening economy and the resultant i ncrease in the number of subscriptions sold with terms 
abandoned asset expense increased because we abandoned internally developed code that we no longer believe will be compatible with our new technology platform 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in consulting fees and  in non cash stock compensation expense 
consulting fees were higher in because of consulting services associated with our office relocation and non cash stock compensation expense decreased because of a revision in our estimated forfeiture rate based on historical information 
idle lease charges onvia recorded a reduction in expenses of million for the year ended december  related to our idle lease accrual 
the decrease was to eliminate the remaining balance in our idle lease accrual as a result of the termination of our lease on our former corporate headquarters building 
the following table displays rollforwards of the idle lease accrual which was reduced to at december  amounts accruals at paid  net accruals at december  of sublease december  reduction income idle lease charges other income  net other income  net consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  interest expense associated with operating leases and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year over year decreases in and is primarily attributable to a decrease in short term interest rates as compared to the prior year 
in addition  at the end of  we reallocated all of our investments into a us treasury cash reserve fund to mitigate our credit risk associated with our investment portfolio in light of the downturn in the financial services industry  which have a significantly lower rate of r eturn than our previous investments  but greater investment security 
during  we moved a portion of our investments into fdic insured or us government backed short term securities  which carry a slightly higher return than the money market funds 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense relates to capital leases for server equipment 
provision for income taxes we have incurred net operating losses  or nol  from our inception through december   with the exception of the third quarter of and the third and fourth quarters of because of this history of net operating losses  and until we can demonstrate consistent quarterly net income  we do not currently believe that the future realization of the tax benefit associated with these net loss carryforwards is more likely than not  therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the likelihood that these tax benefits may be realized  and may reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance in the future if it is determined that realization of these benefits is more likely than not 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the future  the company plans to complete a section analysis regarding ownership changes that may have occurred  but at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate whether such a change has occurred 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
we currently have a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets as the future realization or the tax benefit is not more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million 
this increase was driven by higher sales during  which resulted in an increase of million in deferred revenue for prepaid subscription services 
vendor and employee payments also decreased because included payments for our office relocation and severance payments for two senior executives 
these changes were partially offset by payments of million for additions to internally developed software for our new technology platform and othe r new products 
we were able to generate positive cash flow from operations in  primarily because of the increase in sales during the year  which was driven in part by the increase in our acquisition sales force and increased interest in our services from the federal government s economic stimulus activity 
we will seek to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future via our efforts to increase client acquisition  retention and increasing our acv 
until such time as we begin generating recurring positive cash flows from operations  we will utilize our current cash and cash equivalents and current revenues to fund operations 
we expect to increase revenue from current operations by increasing our acv through a combination of expansion of our product offering and scheduled price increases 
we have established more stringent policies for granting extended payment terms for our clients in light of increasing default rates on subscriptions with these types of terms 
the continuingly difficult economy has triggered an increase in requests for delayed payment terms  such as quarterly payment terms 
if we reduce the availability of credit to our clients  they may refuse to purchase and our operating cash flow may be adversely impacted in the near term  however  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund current operations for the near term foreseeable future 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and net cash provided by operating activities of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change from net cash used to net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in sales during  which resulted in an increase in cash collected for prepaid subscriptions 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities increased by million in compared to  because we moved a portion of our investment portfolio from money market funds  which are considered cash equivalents  into fdic insured and us government backed funds during in addition  cash provided by investing activities in included million from the return of a security deposit on our old corporate headquarters and reimbursements for tenant improvements on our new building and we did not receive such payments in the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in net sales and maturity of investments  offset by the return of reimbursable tenant improvements during financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was principally related to the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and was offset by principal payments on capital leases 
in  cash provided by option exercises and espp purchases was entirely offset by principal payments on capital leases 
decreases in our stock price during and resulted in a decrease in the number of option exercises compared to prior years
