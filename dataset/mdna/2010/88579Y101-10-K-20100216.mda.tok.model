item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
results are impacted by the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic and capital markets conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives approximately percent of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions  or in the various industries in which the company operates  social  political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions  or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  tax rates  or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company s credit ratings are important to m s cost of capital 
the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s credit profile and have assigned debt ratings to m that are near the top of the ratings spectrum 
this evaluation is based on a number of factors  which include financial strength  business and financial risk  as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
the company has an aa credit rating  with a stable outlook  from standard poor s and an aa credit rating  with a stable outlook  from moody s investors service 
the company s strong ratings serve to lower m s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders 
failure to maintain the current ratings level could adversely affect the company s cost of funds  liquidity and access to capital markets 
the company s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 
demand for the company s products  which impacts revenue and profit margins  is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products  ii the company s response to downward pricing to stay competitive  iii changes in customer order patterns  such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes  changes in the company s incentive programs  or the customer s ability to achieve incentive goals  and iv changes in customers preferences for our products  including the success of products offered by our competitors  and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company s products 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately percent of the company s revenues are derived from outside the united states  the company s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  or gain market acceptance of new products 
there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components  compounds  raw materials and energy  including oil and natural gas and their derivatives  due to shortages  increased demand  supply interruptions  currency exchange risks  natural disasters and other factors 
the company depends on various components  compounds  raw materials  and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products 
it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events  or be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures  and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies  and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results 
the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures and changes to its organizational structure 
with respect to acquisitions  future results will be affected by the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 
the company s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated 
the company utilizes various tools  such as lean six sigma  to improve operational efficiency and productivity 
there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 
the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings  including those involving product liability  antitrust  environmental or other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  a significant settlement  significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period

asc requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption 
see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits 
using this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of for us pension and for us postretirement to be appropriate as of december   which is a decrease from the rate used as of december  for the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december  was  a decrease from the rate used as of december  a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with asc  is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  the expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for is  the same as refer to note for information on how the rate was determined 
return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan by plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long term rate of return assumptions 
the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is for  comparable to the weighted average expected return of for for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  up from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately million in for the pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in 
table of contents the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
see note for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
asset impairments as of december   net property  plant and equipment totaled billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled billion 
management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 
impairments recorded in  and related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note in june  m s security systems division within the safety  security and protection services business segment was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of m s existing uk passport contracts in october m remains confident in the future of its overall passport business  and the growth prospects remain strong 
m continues to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other countries 
however  as a result of this event  in june  m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives 
in addition  m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit security systems division level 
the result of the june test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping s carrying amount of approximately million before impairment exceeded the remaining expected cash flows 
accordingly  m recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in the second quarter of to write these assets down to their fair value 
in addition  accelerated depreciation amortization is being taken over the period june through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets 
m goodwill totaled approximately billion as of december   which  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level  with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level m has six business segments at december   but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
at m  reporting units generally correspond to a division 
as of december   m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio for comparable industry groups  or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
m typically uses the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 
m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start up  loss position and declining businesses  but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 
m completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
as of december   m had primary reporting units  with eight reporting units accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill 
these eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions m purification inc  occupational health and environmental safety  optical systems  m espe  communication markets  industrial adhesives and tapes  security systems  and health information systems 
the fair values for the majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than percent 
the fair values for m purification inc  optical systems and security systems  based on fourth quarter testing  were in excess of carrying value by approximately percent to percent  with no impairment indicated 
as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter  m used a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for its m purification inc  optical systems and security systems divisions  using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions  among other factors 
the weighting was based on management s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

table of contents in  for those reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than percent  m primarily used an industry price earnings ratio approach  but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units 
in  m adjusted the stated applicable industry price earnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter  unlike prior years when no adjustment was required 
without this adjustment  the addition of each reporting unit s estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of m s total company market value  which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium 
the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to m s total company market value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 
for example  at year end  m s market value was approximately billion  but if each reporting unit was sold individually  m s value would be approximately billion using a percent control premium 
m factored down its price earnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the price earnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately percent for the total company 
even after including this adjustment to the price earnings ratio  no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in in the fourth quarter of  m s estimated control premium ranged from to percent  with no adjustment required to the price earnings ratios 
based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of  no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 
in addition  m s market value at december  of approximately billion is significantly in excess of its equity of approximately billion 
factors which could result in future impairment charges  among others  include changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risk factors are discussed in item a  risk factors  of this document 
as of december   m had approximately billion of goodwill related to m purification inc  million related to optical systems  and million of goodwill associated with the security systems division 
if future non cash impairment charges are taken  m would expect that only a portion of the long lived assets or goodwill would be impaired 
m will continue to monitor its reporting units in for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 
income taxes the extent of m s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
as of january   the company follows guidance provided by asc  income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes  to record these liabilities refer to note for additional information 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company s current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if the company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 
the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities 
these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company 
included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts  capital commitments  service agreements and utilities

many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers 
the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations 
contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table  but these commitments represent a small part of the company s expected capital spending in and beyond 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of m s products and services are purchased as needed  with no unconditional commitment 
for this reason  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
other obligations  included in the preceding table within the caption entitled unconditional purchase obligations and other  include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of the net tax liability of million is excluded from the preceding table

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a percent confidence level over a month time horizon 
the model used analyzed currencies  interest rates related to two currencies  and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit decreased in primarily due to decreases in volatility during  which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model 
the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures 
adverse impact on positive impact on after tax earnings after tax earnings millions foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity rates the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year
