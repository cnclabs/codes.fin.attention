throughout this document  the naming convention for these series is consistent with the current branding 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity includes assessing our level of involvement in establishing the entity  determining whether we provide more than half of any management  operational or financial support to the entity  and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or returns 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar sprint cup and nationwide series schedules as well as the nascar camping world truck series schedule beginning in fiscal year event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining percent to the event promoter 
the event promoter pays percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event as part of awards to the competitors 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative fair value 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
accounts receivable 
we regularly review the collectability of our accounts receivable 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired including recognized intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar  grand american and or irl 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
asc  are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised of assets having finite useful lives  which are amortized over that period  and goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
current accounting standards require testing these assets for impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or annually  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future  our analyses are subjective and are based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our judgments with regard to our future business prospects could impact whether or not an impairment is deemed to have occurred  as well as the timing of the recognition of such an impairment charge 
our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including general liability  workers compensation  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated by considering various historical trends and forward looking assumptions related to costs  claim counts and payments 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
under this interpretation  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
derivative instruments 
from time to time  we utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and locks to assist in managing our interest rate risk 
we do not enter into any interest rate swap or lock derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we account for the interest rate swaps and locks in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asc  as amended 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if either the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible or an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 

table of contents acquisition and divestitures raceway associates on february   we acquired the percent ownership interested in raceway associates  llc raceway associates we did not previously own  bringing our ownership to percent 
raceway associates operates chicagoland speedway chicagoland and route raceway route 
the purchase price for the percent ownership interest totaled approximately million  including approximately million paid to the prior owners  the assumption of third party liabilities and acquisition costs  net of cash received 
the purchase price was paid with cash on hand and approximately million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
this transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our consolidated operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we believe that the chicagoland and route acquisitions are well positioned in the nation s third largest media market with a strong motorsports fan base 
the purchase price for the raceway associates acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair market values at the acquisition date 
included in this acquisition are certain indefinite lived intangible assets attributable to the sanction agreements in place at the time of acquisition and goodwill 
nazareth speedway after the completion of nazareth s fiscal events we suspended indefinitely its major motorsports event operations 
the nascar nationwide series and irl indycar series events  then conducted at nazareth  were realigned to other motorsports entertainment facilities within our portfolio 
the property on which the former nazareth speedway was located continues to be marketed for sale 
for all periods presented  the results of operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations 
impairment of long lived assets northwest us speedway development since  we had been pursuing development of a motorsports entertainment facility in kitsap county  washington  which required state legislation to help finance the project 
in early this legislation was introduced in both the washington state house of representatives and senate 
on april   we announced that despite agreeing to substantial changes to the required legislation it had become apparent that additional modifications would be proposed to the bill 
due to the increased risk that the collective modifications would have a significant negative impact on the project s financial model  we felt it was in our best long term interest to discontinue our efforts at the site 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge in fiscal of approximately million  or per diluted share  to reflect the write off of certain capitalized costs including legal  consulting  capitalized interest and other project specific costs 
the charge is included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november  we still believe the pacific northwest represents an attractive long term opportunity  and remain interested in a motorsports entertainment facility development project in the region 
new york metropolitan speedway development in connection with our efforts to develop a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area  our subsidiary  development  llc  purchased a total of acres located in the new york city borough of staten island in early fiscal and began improvements including fill operations on the property 
in december  we announced our decision to discontinue pursuit of the speedway development on staten island 
in may  we entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation dec to resolve certain issues surrounding the fill operations and the prior placement of fill at the site that contained constituents above regulatory thresholds 
the consent order required us to remove non compliant fill pursuant to an approved comprehensive fill removal plan  and to pay a penalty to dec of  half of which was paid in may and the other half of which was suspended so long as we complied with the terms of the consent order 
during the second quarter of fiscal the dec notified us that it had complied with the terms of the consent order and that we had no further obligations under the consent order 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined  based on our understanding of the real estate market and the prospective transaction  that the current carrying value of the property was in excess of the fair market value 
as a result  we recognized a non cash  pre tax charge in our results of approximately million  or per diluted 
table of contents share  which is included in the motorsports event segment 
in october  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with kb marine holdings llc kb holdings under which kb holdings would acquire of the outstanding equity membership interests of development for a total purchase price of million 
the transaction is scheduled to close by february  however  the closing is subject to certain conditions including kb holdings securing the required equity commitments to acquire the property and performing its obligation under the agreement 
that performance may be affected by its failure to obtain resolution of certain issues relating to the fill permitting process 
the failure to meet these conditions could delay the closing or result in the termination of the agreement 
equity and other investments motorsports authentics in the fourth quarter of fiscal we partnered with speedway motorsports  inc in a joint venture  smisc  llc smisc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc conducts business under the name motorsports authentics ma 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  ma acquired team caliber and action performance  inc  respectively  and became a leader in design  promotion  marketing and distribution of motorsports licensed merchandise 
in fiscal  as a result of certain significant driver and team changes and excess merchandise on hand  ma recognized a write down of inventory and related assets 
in addition  in fiscal ma completed forward looking strategic financial planning 
the resulting financial projections were utilized in its annual valuation analysis of goodwill  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets which resulted in an impairment charge to us of million  or per diluted share on such assets 
in fiscal  ma management and ownership considered various approaches to optimize performance in ma s various distribution channels 
as the challenges were assessed  it became apparent that there was significant risk in future business initiatives in mass apparel  memorabilia and other yet to be developed products 
these initiatives had previously been deemed achievable and were included in projections that supported the carrying value of inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets on ma s balance sheet 
this analysis  combined with a long term macroeconomic outlook that is believed to be less robust than previously expected  triggered ma s review of certain assets under sfas asc and asc 
factors considered in the review by ma s management and an independent appraisal firm included the fact that while ma is in the process of renegotiating its agreements with major nascar team licensors  many of which are in default due to ma s failure to pay the unearned portion of certain guaranteed royalties 
there is no certainty that these licensors will agree to revision of current license contract terms or continue to grant ma licensing rights under acceptable terms in the future  and financial projections indicating significant losses at the ebitda level from fiscal through fiscal absent such contract revisions 
absent a favorable outcome of current license agreement renegotiations regarding the unearned portion of certain guaranteed royalties as noted above  ma has exposure to a material amount of future guaranteed royalty payments that  in a worst case scenario  could be asserted as immediately due 
we have exposure to a guarantee liability to one nascar team licensor which is limited to million in a worst case 
this exposure is disclosed in our consolidated financial statements as a contingent liability 
while we believe it is possible that some obligation under this guarantee may occur in the future  the amount we ultimately pay cannot be estimated at this time 
in any event  we do not believe that the ultimate financial outcome will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as a result of the review  ma s management  with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm  concluded that the fair value of ma s goodwill and intangible assets should be reduced to zero 
we have evaluated the carrying value of our equity investment in ma  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock asc as a result of our evaluation performed under apb asc  we reduced the carrying value of our investment in ma to zero and recognized an impairment charge of million or per diluted share 
this impairment charge is included in the equity investment losses on the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents our percent portion of ma s fiscal net loss is approximately million  or per diluted share  which included the aforementioned impairment charges 
fiscal equity in net income from ma was approximately million  or per diluted share 
ma continues to explore business strategies in conjunction with certain motorsports industry stakeholders that allow the possibility for ma to operate profitably in the future 
as with any business in this adverse economic environment  management must find the optimal business model for long term viability 
in addition to revisiting the business vision for ma  management  with support of ownership  is also undertaking certain initiatives to improve inventory controls and buying cycles  as well as implementing changes to make ma a more efficiently operated and profitable company 
we believe a revised ma business vision  which must include successful resolution of current license agreement terms and favorable license terms in the future  along with focus on core competencies  streamlined operations  reduced operating costs and inventory risk  are necessary for ma to survive as a profitable operation in the future 
should the aforementioned renegotiations of the license agreements on terms that allow ma reasonable future opportunities to operate profitably not be successful  should management decide to allow license defaults to remain uncured  or should licensors not grant extended cure periods and exercise their rights under the agreements  ma s ability to continue operating could be severely impacted 
if such efforts are not sufficient or timely ma could ultimately pursue bankruptcy 
daytona development project in may  we announced that we had entered into a joint venture with a development partner  the cordish company cordish  to explore a potential mixed use entertainment destination development on acres 
the proposed development would be located directly across international speedway boulevard from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility 
preliminary conceptual designs call for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area including a movie theater with up to  seats  a residential component and a room hotel 
the initial development includes approximately  square feet of office space the international motorsports center to house our new headquarters  as well as that of nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
construction of the office building was completed during the fourth quarter of in november  following the successful completion of the office component of the project  we acquired cordish s percent interest in the overall development which includes all of the interests in the office building and we will assume responsibility for future phases of the overall development 
we have consolidated this entity in our financial statements as of november  the new headquarters office building was financed in july through a million construction term loan obtained by daytona beach property headquarters building  llc dbphb  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which was created to own and operate the office building 
specific financing considerations for the development project are dependent on several factors  including lease arrangements  availability of project financing and overall market conditions 
the company has relocated from its prior office building  which is expected be razed as part of our daytona development project 
additional depreciation on this prior office building totaled approximately million and million for the years ended november  and  respectively 
while we continue to believe that a mixed use retail dining entertainment area located across from its daytona facility will be a successful project  given the current economic conditions and the uncertainty associated with the future  development of the project will depend on its economical feasibility 
kansas hotel and casino development in september  our wholly owned subsidiary kansas speedway development corporation ksdc and the cordish company entity  kansas entertainment investors  with whom we formed kansas entertainment  llc kansas entertainment to pursue this project  submitted a joint proposal to the unified government for the development of a casino  hotel and retail and entertainment project in wyandotte county  on property adjacent to kansas speedway 
the unified government has approved rezoning of approximately acres at kansas speedway to allow development of the proposed project 
the kansas lottery commission will act as the state s casino owner 
in september  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board awarded the casino management contract for the northeast kansas gaming zone to kansas entertainment 
on december   kansas entertainment withdrew 
table of contents its application for lottery gaming facility manager for the northeast kansas gaming zone due to the uncertainty in the global financial markets and the expected inability to debt finance the full project at reasonable rates 
in january  the state of kansas re opened the bidding process for the casino management contract with proposals due by april  kansas entertainment submitted a revised joint proposal to the kansas lottery commission and the unified government for the phased development of a casino and certain dining and entertainment options 
the proposal also contemplates the development  depending upon market conditions and demand  of a hotel  convention facility and retail and entertainment district 
in september  kansas entertainment investors  our partner in kansas entertainment  was replaced by penn national gaming penn 
as a result  penn holds percent of the membership interests in the planned project and is the managing member of kansas entertainment 
penn will be responsible for the development and operation of the casino and hotel 
on december   the kansas lottery gaming facility review board approved kansas entertainment as the gaming facility operator in the northeast zone wyandotte county 
based on its selection  and subject to background investigations and licensing by the kansas racing and gaming commission which are expected to be completed in february  kansas entertainment plans to begin construction of the hollywood themed and branded entertainment destination facility in the second half of with a planned opening in the first quarter of the initial phase of the project  which is planned to comprise approximately  square feet  includes a  square foot casino gaming floor with approximately  slot machines and table games  a high energy center bar  and dining and entertainment options and is budgeted at approximately million 
kansas entertainment anticipates partially funding the first phase of the development with a minimum equity contribution of million from each partner in mid in addition  kansas entertainment currently plans to pursue financing of approximately million  preferably on a project secured non recourse basis 
land that we already own is assumed to be valued at approximately million post licensing and leased gaming equipment of approximately million would complete the financing of the project s first phase 
the full budget of all potential phases is projected at over million  and would be financed by the joint venture between ksdc and penn 
we are currently evaluating the existing arrangements of kansas entertainment and  as of november   have not determined whether it will be a variable interest entity  in accordance with the fasb interpretation no 
r asc  however it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary 
other equity investments our equity investments also include our percent limited partnership investment in stock car montreal lp prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in february and our pro rata share of our percent equity investment in raceway associates prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in february accounting adjustment during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  to correct the carrying value amount of certain other assets 
this adjustment was recorded in interest income and other in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe the adjustment is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended november  and in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab topic n  we considered qualitative and quantitative factors  including the income from continuing operations we reported in each of the prior years and for the current year  the non cash nature of the adjustment and our substantial shareholders equity at the end of each of the prior years 
income taxes the tax treatment related to the uncertainties associated with the losses incurred by our equity investee smisc  is the principal cause of the increased effective income tax rate for the fiscal years ended november  and the increased rate in fiscal was partially offset by the reduction in income taxes due to the interest income related to the settlement with the service in the second quarter of fiscal see internal revenue service exmanination 
current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to such routine litigation incident to our business  we are a party to the litigation described below 
in july  kentucky speedway  llc filed a civil action in the eastern district of kentucky against nascar and 
table of contents us which alleged that nascar and isc have acted  and continue to act  individually and in combination and collusion with each other and other companies that control motorsports entertainment facilities hosting nascar nextel cup series  to illegally restrict the award of 
nascar nextel cup series 
races 
the complaint was amended in to seek  in addition to damages  an injunction requiring nascar to develop objective factors for the award of nextel cup races  divestiture of isc and nascar so that the france family and anyone else does not share ownership of both companies or serve as officers or directors of both companies  isc s divestiture of at least of its racetracks that currently operate a nextel cup race and prohibiting further alleged violations of the antitrust laws 
the complaint did not ask the court to cause nascar to award a nextel cup race to the kentucky speedway 
other than some vaguely conclusory allegations  the complaint failed to specify any specific unlawful conduct by us 
pre trial discovery in the case was concluded and based upon all of the factual and expert evidentiary materials adduced we were more firmly convinced than ever that the case was without legal or factual merit 
on january  our position was vindicated when the federal district court judge hearing the case ruled in favor of isc and nascar and entered a judgment which stated that all claims of the plaintiff  kentucky speedway  llc  were thereby dismissed  with prejudice  at the cost of the plaintiff 
the opinion and order of the court entered on the same day concluded that kentucky speedway had failed to make out its case 
subsequently  on january  kentucky speedway  llc filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeal for the sixth circuit 
in a written opinion dated december  the sixth circuit court of appeals agreed with the district court that kentucky speedway had failed to make out its case and affirmed the judgment of the district court in favor of isc and nascar 
on december  kentucky speedway filed a petition for rehearing with the sixth circuit court of appeals wherein kentucky speedway has requested the sixth circuit to reconsider its ruling in favor of isc and nascar 
we expect the appellate process to be resolved in our favor in approximately to months 
at this point the likelihood of a materially adverse result appears to be remote  although there is always an element of uncertainty in litigation 
it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential magnitude of such a remote possible adverse decision 
the fees and expenses associated with the defense of this suit have not been covered by insurance and have adversely impacted our financial condition 
the court has assessed the allowable costs not including legal fees owed to us and has ordered kentucky speedway to post a bond for the payment of such costs  pending the outcome of the appeal to the sixth circuit 
future trends in operating results economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  the rise in unemployment and increased fuel and food costs  significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal we have seen certain of these trends persist throughout fiscal and expect they will continue to adversely impact our business well into  which negatively impacts our attendance related  as well as corporate partner  revenues 
admissions an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing closely on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities 
by effectively managing ticket prices and seating capacity  we can stimulate ticket renewals and advance sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual and forecasted inclement weather on ticket sales 
with any ticketing program  we first examine our pricing structure to ensure that prices are in line with market demand 
typically  we raise prices on select areas of our facilities during any one year 
when necessary  we will reduce pricing on inventory 
we are sensitive to the economic challenges that many of our fans face  and to address this  in  we lowered prices on over  seats  or percent of our grandstand capacity  for nascar sprint cup events across the company 
for our events  we are expanding our reduced pricing to approximately  seats throughout our facilities as well as unbundling a substantial number of tickets to better respond to consumer demand 
in addition to pricing  
table of contents we are providing our customers that renew early various incentives as well as special access privileges 
in addition  we have created ticket packages that provide added value opportunities  making it more affordable for our fans to attend live events 
these packages may include an all you can eat component  fuel saving offers  and military discounts 
as we want to develop the next generation motorsports fan  we have expanded our youth initiative to encourage families to attend 
we believe our pricing levels and initiatives are on target with demand  based on our research and analysis  while not damaging the long term value of our business 
it is important that we maintain the integrity of our pricing model by rewarding our best and loyal customers 
we do not adjust pricing inside of the sales cycle and avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
further  we limit and monitor the availability of promotional tickets 
all of these factors could have a detrimental effect on our pricing model and long term value of our business 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
corporate partnerships with regard to corporate marketing partner relationships  we believe that our presence in key markets  impressive portfolio of events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial and help to mitigate adverse economic trends as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships 
for example  fiscal was the first year of our multi year  multi facility official status agreement with coca cola  which ranks as one of the most significant official status marketing partnerships in our history 
in addition  we benefited from our first multi year facility naming rights agreement between auto club of southern california and our california facility that began in as the economic outlook further deteriorated in the latter part of fiscal and has extended into fiscal  we are experiencing a slowdown in corporate spending 
in addition  the process of securing sponsorship deals has become more time consuming as corporations are more closely scrutinizing their marketing budgets 
we expect these trends to continue into despite current economic conditions  we continue to bring new sponsors into the sport  such as able body labor  godaddy 
com  kraft foods and hp hood 
we continue to believe that revenues from our corporate marketing relationships will grow over the long term  contributing to strong earnings and cash flow stability and predictability 
television broadcast and ancillary media rights domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues are an important component of our revenue and earnings stream 
starting in  nascar entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its three national touring series sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck 
the agreements total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees were approximately million for  and will increase  on average  by approximately three percent per year through the season 
the annual increase is expected to vary between two and four percent per year over the period 
fox and tnt have been strong supporters of nascar racing since  and both have played a major role in the sports climb in popularity 
we have and expect to continue to see ongoing broadcast innovation in their coverage of nascar racing events 
also notable was the return of espn to the sport in  which it helped build throughout the s and s 
espn s coverage and weekly ancillary nascar related programming continues to promote the sport across various properties 
further  espn broadcasts substantially all of the nascar nationwide series  providing that growing series with the continuity and promotional support that will allow it to flourish 
we are optimistic with abc s recent decision to broadcast the majority of its nascar sprint cup series events on its cable channel  espn 
espn  with a subscriber base at approximately million  has the proven ability to attract younger viewers as well as create more exposure 
also  cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to traditional networks 
a potential benefit for when nascar negotiates the next consolidated domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights contract 
while the media landscape continues to evolve  we continue to believe nascar s position in the sports and entertainment landscape remains strong 
it is expected that ratings will fluctuate year to year 
the long term ratings health of nascar sprint cup series events remains robust as they are the second highest rated regular season sport 
table of contents on television 
in addition  the nascar nationwide series is the second highest rated motorsports series on television and the nascar camping world truck series is the third highest rated motorsports series on cable television 
these long term contracts give significant cash flow visibility to us  race teams and nascar over the contract period 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted at our wholly owned facilities under these agreements  and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue  were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
operating income generated by these media rights were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events  as part of prize and point fund money 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
we anticipate any operating margin improvement to come primarily from economies of scale and controlling costs in areas such as motorsports related and general and administrative expenses 
sanctioning bodies our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal nascar continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of nascar sprint cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
nascar approved realignments of certain nascar sprint cup and other events at our facilities 
we believe that the realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
capital improvements since we compete with newer entertainment venues for patrons and sponsors  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our facilities  thereby producing additional revenue opportunities and improving the event experience for our guests 
major examples of these efforts include fiscal in connection with the construction of the three tiered grandstand at richmond international raceway richmond  we completed a person  members only torque club for individual fans looking to enjoy a race weekend in style or businesses seeking to entertain clients 
the torque club also serves as a unique site for special events on non race weekends throughout the year 
escalators to improve traffic flow to the new torque club and grandstand were added in fiscal fiscal we installed track lighting at chicagoland as well as improved certain electrical infrastructure in certain camping areas 
in addition to enhancing the guest experience  we now have the flexibility to run events later in the day in the event of inclement weather  we repaved darlington raceway darlington and constructed a tunnel in turn that provides improved access for fans and allows emergency vehicles to easily enter and exit the infield area of the track 
these 
table of contents collective projects mark the largest one time investment in the year history of the storied south carolina facility  we enhanced seating at michigan international speedway michigan to provide wider seats  seatbacks and more leg room for fans 
we also added incremental camping capacity and new shower restroom facilities for our on site overnight guests  as well as installed a state of the art foot  three sided led scoreboard for fans to more easily follow the on track competition 
finally  we added additional branded way finding signage to help pedestrians  motorists and campers find their way in  out and around the  acre racetrack property  and we constructed new media centers at watkins glen international watkins glen and homestead miami speedway homestead  which we believe increased appeal to media content providers  sports journalists  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in the motorsports industry 
fiscal we constructed a new media center at michigan as part of the terrace suite redevelopment project which we believe has increased appeal to media content providers  sports journalists  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in the motorsports industry  to further enhance our guest experience  we reconfigured tram and pedestrian routes at richmond  built a new tram stop at daytona  and  replaced the seats in the lower grandstands at talladega  and we have constructed a new leader board at homestead  which is the prototype for future tracks 
we anticipate modest capital spending on other projects for maintenance  safety and regulatory requirements  as well as for preserving the guest experience at our events to enable us to effectively compete with other sports venues for consumer and corporate spending 
growth strategies our growth strategies also include exploring ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
this has most recently been demonstrated through the acquisitions of the additional interests in raceway associates  owner and operator of chicagoland and route and our planned real estate development joint ventures see daytona development project and kansas hotel and casino development 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events the postponement or cancellation of one or more major motorsports events could adversely impact our future operating results 
a postponement or cancellation could be caused by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  inclement weather  a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis  a general postponement or cancellation of all major sporting events in this country as occurred following the september  terrorist attacks  a terrorist attack at any mass gathering or fear of such an attack  conditions resulting from the wars in iraq and afghanistan or other acts or prospects of war

table of contents comparison of fiscal to fiscal the comparison of fiscal to fiscal is impacted by the following factors economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  and the rise in unemployment  began to manifest in early fiscal and have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal  further impacting the comparability of the periods were strong consumer and corporate sales for the th running of the daytona in fiscal this monumental anniversary of the great american race provided significant unique opportunities to drive attendance and revenue above the otherwise strong appeal of this marquee event and the sport of nascar in general  on february   we acquired the percent ownership interest in stock car montreal lp we did not previously own  bringing our ownership to percent 
this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the operations of stock car montreal lp are included in our consolidated operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
prior to this date  we had accounted for their operations as part of equity in net loss from equity investments 
a nascar nationwide series and a grand american series event were held at stock car montreal during the third quarter of fiscal  due to the acquisition of grand american by nascar in october  expenses related to prize  point and sanction fees are reported as part of prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees on the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year while reported as part of motorsports related expense in fiscal and prior years  during fiscal  approximately million  or per diluted share  of depreciation was accelerated above our normal depreciation rates relating to our prior office building in daytona beach  florida which is expected to be razed as part of our daytona development project see further discussion in future liquidity

our portion of motorsports authentics net income for fiscal included in equity in net loss from equity investments was approximately million  or per diluted share see discussion under future trends in operating results  and during the second quarter of fiscal we recognized interest income net of tax  of approximately million  or per diluted share  in our income tax expense as a result of the settlement with the service see internal revenue service examination 
admissions revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the decrease is primarily attributable to the decreases in attendance due to previously discussed adverse economic trends including decreases in weighted average ticket prices as a result of pricing strategies for our nascar sprint cup events in see future trends in operating results 
these decreases are further 
table of contents impacted by the strong demand for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona in fiscal the overall decrease in attendance was partially offset by the consolidation of the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and a slight increase in the weighted average ticket prices for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona in fiscal motorsports related revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decreases in sponsorship  suite and hospitality revenues for certain events conducted during the year  which we believe result largely from the previously discussed adverse economic conditions 
to a lesser extent  lower track rentals  advertising and ancillary rights revenues also contributed to the decrease 
partially offsetting the decrease was the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and an increase in television broadcast rights for our nascar sprint cup  nationwide  and camping world truck series events 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to previously discussed adverse economic conditions impacting attendance as well as lower per capita sales in fiscal affecting catering  concessions and merchandise sales 
in addition  the decrease is impacted by the strong sales of the daytona th anniversary product in fiscal the decrease was slightly offset by the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal 
prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily related to the nationwide series event at stock car montreal and the previously discussed increase in television broadcast rights fees for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted during the year  as standard nascar sanctioning agreements require that a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees be paid to competitors 
to a lesser extent  increased nascar sanction fees  as well as the aforementioned reclassification of amounts related to grand american in fiscal contributed to the increase 
motorsports related expense decreased by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is predominately attributable to reduced promotional  advertising and other race related expenses during the period as a result of focused cost containment initiatives as well as higher promotional and advertising expenses for the th running of the daytona in fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and to a lesser extent  the aforementioned reclassification of amounts related to grand american competition costs in fiscal motorsports related expense as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue was comparable to the prior year  with the slight margin decrease primarily due to the previously discussed lower admissions and motorsports related revenues  as well as the aforementioned stock car montreal events conducted in the third quarter of fiscal  largely offset by initiatives to reduce costs 
food  beverage and merchandise expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to variable costs associated with the lower sales of merchandise  catering and concessions sales related to the previously discussed decreases in attendance

this is especially evident for fiscal speedweeks sales as compared to strong sales surrounding the th running of the daytona in fiscal the decrease in margin was partially offset by certain fixed cost reductions during the year 
general and administrative expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal driven by focused cost containment initiatives  we reduced legal fees  other professional fees  personnel related and various other costs associated with our ongoing business compared to the prior year 
in addition the decrease is impacted by an adjustment to certain other taxes in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal the slight margin decrease is primarily due to the previously discussed decrease in revenues  largely offset by our cost containment efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to capital expenditures for our ongoing facility enhancements and related initiatives 

table of contents the impairment of long lived assets of approximately million in fiscal is primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the carrying value of our staten island property and  to a much lesser extent  certain other long lived asset impairments 
the fiscal impairment consisted primarily of costs associated with the fill removal process at our staten island property and impairments of certain other long lived assets see discussion under impairment of long lived assets 
interest income and other increased by approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is almost entirely due to the aforementioned non cash charge of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  to correct the carrying value of certain other assets 
slightly offsetting the increase were lower interest rates on higher cash balances as compared to the same period in the prior year 
interest expense increased by approximately million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to the amortization of our previous interest rate swap see discussion under future liquidity long term obligations and commitments as well as lower capitalized interest and higher average borrowings on our credit facility during the year see discussion under liquidity and capital resources general as compared to the same period in fiscal  partially offset by the repayment of the million principal senior notes in april equity in net loss from equity investments represents our percent equity investment in motorsports authentics see equity and other investments 
our effective income tax rate increased from approximately percent to percent during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the tax treatment associated with income earned in fiscal and losses incurred in fiscal by motorsports authentics

these decreases are partially offset by the increase in attendance for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona and  to a lesser extent  the increase in attendance at certain events at chicagoland 
the overall decrease in attendance was also partially offset by a slight increase in the weighted average ticket price of tickets sold for the majority of our events 
motorsports related revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in suite and hospitality revenue  track rentals  motorsports publishing services  and advertising for comparable events 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase in the television broadcast and ancillary rights for our nascar sprint cup  nationwide  and camping world truck series 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to previously discussed adverse economic conditions affecting attendance and inclement weather for the above mentioned event

partially offsetting the above items was the previously discussed charge relating to kansas entertainment 
our effective income tax rate decreased from approximately percent to percent during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the tax treatment associated with losses incurred in fiscal and income earned in fiscal by motorsports authentics as well as certain restructuring initiatives in fiscal and certain state tax implications relating to the impairment of long lived assets recognized in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by the tax exempt nature of the aforementioned non cash charge to interest income and other during the first quarter of fiscal the operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no

as a result of the foregoing  net income increased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal also contributing to the increase in the earnings per diluted share is the reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the previously discussed stock repurchase program 
liquidity and capital resources general we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures at existing facilities  payments of an annual cash dividend and more recently  to repurchase our shares under our stock purchase plan 
in addition  we have used the proceeds from offerings of our class a common stock  the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects 
at november   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million  million principal amount of senior notes outstanding  million in current borrowings on our million revolving credit facility  a debt service funding commitment of approximately million principal amount related to the taxable special obligation revenue tif bonds issued by the unified government of wyandotte county kansas city  kansas unified government and  million principal amount of other third party debt 
at november   we had working capital of million  primarily driven by funding the april current maturity of million principal amount senior notes and the million recovery of funds previously on deposit with the service 
at november   we had a working capital deficit of million  primarily as a result of the cash used for the 
table of contents acquisitions of our common stock under our stock purchase plans and the previously noted april maturity becoming a current liability 
our liquidity is primarily generated from our ongoing motorsports operations  and we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future 
in addition  as of november   we have approximately million available to draw upon under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
see future liquidity for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity 
as it relates to capital allocation  our top priority is fan and competitor safety  as well as regulatory compliance 
in addition  we remain focused on driving incremental earnings by improving the fan experience to increase ticket sales 
beyond that  we are also making strategic investments in external projects that complement our core business and provide value for our shareholders 
those options include ancillary real estate development  acquisitions  new market development  and share repurchases 
during fiscal year  our significant cash flows items include the following net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  capital expenditures totaling approximately million  payments of long term debt totaling approximately million  decrease in restricted cash totaling approximately million  payments under our credit facility totaling approximately million  dividends paid totaling approximately million  and reacquisitions of previously issued common stock totaling approximately million

as a result of these currently approved projects and anticipated additional approvals in fiscal  we expect our total fiscal capital expenditures at our existing facilities will be approximately million to million depending on the timing of certain projects 
we review the capital expenditure program periodically and modify it as required to meet current business needs 

table of contents future liquidity general as discussed in future trends in operating results  economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  the rise in unemployment and increased fuel and food costs  significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal substantially all of these trends to continued into  which negatively impacted year over year comparability for most all of our revenue categories with the exception of domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees 
our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments  any equity contributions in connection with the kansas hotel and casino development  any potential payments associated with our keepwell agreements  payments for share repurchases under our stock purchase plan  and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the current legal proceeding discussed in part ii legal proceedings 
accordingly  in october  as a result of our desire to build cash balances due to the challenges facing the credit markets  we drew down on our million credit facility see below in future liquidity the million necessary to fund the million in senior notes maturing in april see below in future liquidity 
we have and will continue to utilize operating cash flow combined with the funds recovered as a result of our audit settlement with the service to pay down the balance on the credit facility 
we remain interested in pursuing further development and or acquisition opportunities including the possible development of new motorsports entertainment facilities  such as the new york metropolitan area  the northwest us  denver and other areas  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments  of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  over the longer term we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors 
in addition to economic conditions  consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow 
long term obligations and commitments on april   we completed an offering of million principal amount of unsecured senior notes in a private placement 
on september   we completed an offer to exchange the senior notes for registered senior notes with substantially identical terms senior notes 
at november   outstanding senior notes totaled approximately million  net of unamortized discounts and premium  which is comprised of million principal amount unsecured senior notes  which bear interest at percent and are due april

the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part  at our option  at any time or from time to time at redemption prices as defined in the indenture 
our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the senior notes 
in june we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively lock in a substantial portion of the interest rate exposure on approximately million notional amount in anticipation of refinancing the million percent senior notes that matured in april this interest rate swap was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asc 
as a result of the uncertainty with the us credit markets we postponed the refinancing of the percent senior notes that matured in the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  in february  we amended and re designated our interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
this amended agreement  with a principal notional amount of million and an estimated fair value of a liability totaling million at november   expires in february the estimated fair value is based on relevant market information and quoted market prices at november  and is recognized in other comprehensive loss or interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the re designation  the fair value of the previous interest rate swap arrangement totaling approximately million  was frozen in other comprehensive income 
during fiscal  we amortized approximately million  or per diluted share  of this balance and is reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal we expect to amortize up to approximately million of this balance in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with our february   acquisition of the percent ownership interest in raceway associates we did not previously own  we assumed approximately million in third party debt  consisting of three bank term loans and two revenue bonds payable

speedway developments in light of nascar s publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the nascar sprint cup series schedule  we also believe there are still potential development opportunities in other new  underserved markets across the country 
as such  we have been and are exploring opportunities for public private partnerships targeted to develop one or more motorsports entertainment facilities in new markets  including denver  colorado  the northwest us and the new york metropolitan area 
daytona development project in may  we announced that we had entered into a joint venture with a development partner  the cordish company cordish  to explore a potential mixed use entertainment destination development on acres 
the proposed development would be located directly across international speedway boulevard from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility 
preliminary conceptual designs call for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area including a movie theater with up to  seats  a residential component and a room hotel 
the initial development includes approximately  square feet of office space the international motorsports center to house our new headquarters  as well as that of nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
construction of the office building was completed during the fourth quarter of in november  following the successful completion of the office component of the project  we acquired cordish s percent interest in the overall development which includes all of the interests in the office building and we will assume responsibility for future phases of the overall development 
we have consolidated this entity in our financial statements as of november  the new headquarters office building was financed in july through a million construction term loan obtained by daytona beach property headquarters building  llc dbphb  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which was created to own and operate the office building 
specific financing considerations for the development project are dependent on several factors  including lease arrangements  availability of project financing and overall market conditions 
the company has relocated from its prior office building  which is expected be razed as part of our daytona development project 
additional depreciation on this prior office building totaled approximately million and million for the years ended november  and  respectively 
while we continue to believe that a mixed use retail dining entertainment area located across from its daytona facility will be a successful project  given the current economic conditions and the uncertainty associated with the future  development of the project will depend on its economical feasibility 
kansas hotel and casino development in september  our wholly owned subsidiary kansas speedway development corporation ksdc and the cordish company entity  kansas entertainment investors  with whom we formed kansas entertainment  llc kansas entertainment to pursue this project  submitted a joint proposal to the unified government for the development of a casino  hotel and retail and entertainment project in wyandotte county  on property adjacent to kansas speedway

in september  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board awarded the casino management contract for the northeast kansas gaming zone to kansas entertainment 
on december   kansas entertainment withdrew its application for lottery gaming facility manager for the northeast kansas gaming zone due to the uncertainty in the global financial markets and the expected inability to debt finance the full project at reasonable rates

internal revenue service examination effective may   we entered into a definitive settlement agreement the settlement with the internal revenue service the service in connection with the previously disclosed federal income tax examination for the through fiscal years 
as a result of the settlement  on june   we received approximately million of the million in deposits that we had previously made with the service  beginning in fiscal  in order to prevent incurring additional interest 
in addition  we received approximately million in cash for interest earned on the deposited funds which were ultimately returned to us 
our fiscal results reflect this interest income  net of tax  totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  in the income tax expense of our consolidated statement of operations 
the settlement concludes an examination process the service opened in fiscal that challenged the tax depreciation treatment of a significant portion of our motorsports entertainment facility assets 
we believe the settlement reaches an appropriate compromise on this issue 
as a result of the settlement  we are currently pursuing settlements on similar terms with the appropriate state tax authorities 
under these terms  we expect to pay between million and million in total to finalize the settlements with the various states 
we believe that we have provided adequate reserves related to these various state matters including interest charges through november   and  as a result  do not expect that such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap and lock agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps and locks are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate as well as to lock in certain rates for future debt issuances 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of 
table of contents long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we had approximately million of variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately  at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  from time to time we utilize derivative investments in the form of interest rate swaps and locks to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps and locks match the terms of the debt they are intended to modify 
in june we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively lock in a substantial portion of the interest rate exposure on approximately million notional amount in anticipation of refinancing the million percent senior notes that matured in april this interest rate swap was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asc 
as a result of the uncertainty with the us credit markets we postponed the refinancing of the percent senior notes that matured in the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  on february   we amended and re designated our interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
this amended agreement  with a principal notional amount of million and an estimated fair value of a liability totaling million at november   expires in february the estimated fair value is based on relevant market information and quoted market prices at november  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect fair value estimates 
credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
