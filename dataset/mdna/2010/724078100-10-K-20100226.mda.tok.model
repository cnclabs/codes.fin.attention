executive overview our business principally consists of providing investment banking  institutional brokerage  asset management and related financial services to corporations  private equity groups  public entities  non profit entities and institutional investors in the united states  europe and asia 
we generate revenues primarily through the receipt of advisory and financing fees earned on investment banking activities  commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading activities  net interest earned on securities inventories  profits and losses from trading activities related to these securities inventories and asset management fees 
the securities business is a human capital business 
accordingly  compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses  and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract  develop and retain highly skilled employees who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients 
in  we expanded our asset management and capital markets businesses through two acquisitions 
on september   we acquired fiduciary asset management  llc famco  a st 
louis based asset management firm 
on october   we acquired goldbond capital holdings limited goldbond  a hong kong based investment bank 
the acquisitions resulted in incremental revenues and expenses in the first three quarters of  when compared with the comparable periods in as part of our growth strategy to expand our asset management business  on december  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire advisory research holdings  inc ari  a chicago based asset management firm with approximately billion in assets under management 
we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of  subject to customary regulatory approvals and client consents 
during  we were able to capitalize on a favorable fixed income trading environment and improved equity markets 
we achieved strong results across tax and tax exempt fixed income products 
we enhanced our fixed income platform by expanding our capabilities in corporate credits  taxable municipals and mortgages  as well as our distribution capabilities 
equity capital market conditions continued to improve during resulting in increased revenues across all products 
additionally  the work done in and early to reduce our cost structure enabled us to meet our goal of keeping average quarterly non compensation expenses below million in results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million  or per diluted common share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted common share  for the prior year 
the net loss for included several significant expense items a million after tax charge for impairment of goodwill related to our capital markets business  million of after tax restructuring charges  and 
table of contents million of after tax expense for deal write offs related to travel and legal expenses 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  up percent from million reported in  driven by an improving economy and a strengthening capital markets environment 
in  we achieved significantly improved performance in fixed income institutional brokerage revenues and increased equity and fixed income financing revenues

external factors impacting our business performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  changes in interest rates especially rapid and extreme changes  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the demand for asset management services as reflected by the amount of assets under management 
factors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results 
for example  our business focuses on a middle market clientele in specific industry sectors 
if the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted disproportionately as compared to the economy as a whole  or does not recover on pace with other sectors of the economy  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
in addition  our business could be affected differently than overall market trends 
given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses  our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results 
as a participant in the financial services industry  we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of our business 
in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy  legislators and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry with a view to potential changes  including fundamental changes to the manner in which the industry is regulated and or increased 
table of contents regulation in a number of areas 
changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business 
outlook for global equity financing conditions improved throughout and we expect to see continued strengthening in if markets remain conducive to equity financing 
we expect to see improving trends in middle market advisory activity during  which should result in improved performance in this business 
our public finance business recorded strong performance in as we were able to penetrate new client relationships  expand into new geographies and increase market share 
we believe the strong performance from our public finance business will continue in  however  issuance activity in the non investment grade portion of the public finance markets remains low and we expect only a modest recovery in this segment in additionally  growth within our public finance business could be negatively impacted by budget pressures in the public sector 
we believe the very favorable fixed income institutional brokerage results we experienced in will decline as the fixed income trading environment becomes less attractive in however  we expect the personnel investments we made in and plan to make in to partially offset this decline 
we expect to significantly advance our asset management strategy with the acquisition of ari  which is expected to close in the first quarter of the acquisition of ari will add scale to our asset management strategy and provide a platform to support future organic growth in this business

net revenues from continuing operations in were million  a percent increase compared to million in in  investment banking revenues increased percent to million compared with revenues of 
table of contents million in equity financing revenues contributed to the majority of the increase as all products  particularly registered direct offerings  reported improved performance compared to institutional brokerage revenues increased percent to million in  from million in driven by significantly higher fixed income sales and trading revenues 
in  we recorded large losses on our tender option bond tob program and high yield and structured products 
in  net interest income decreased percent to million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in net interest income earned on net inventory balances as we significantly reduced our balance sheet exposure in late and early  and increased financing costs in related to our funding sources 
in  asset management fees were million  compared with million in  due to lower assets under management resulting from reduced asset valuations 
in  other income was million  essentially flat compared to non interest expenses decreased to million in  from million in in  we incurred a million pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill related to our capital markets business and million of restructuring related charges 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss  including continuing and discontinued operations  of million 
net revenues from continuing operations were million  a percent decline compared to million in in  investment banking revenues decreased percent to million compared with revenues of million in the financial turmoil in resulted in reduced revenues in all areas of investment banking 
equity financing revenues contributed to the majority of the decline as the equity capital markets were essentially on hold in the second half of institutional brokerage revenues declined percent to million in  from million in equity sales and trading revenues increased compared to  but were more than offset by a decline in fixed income sales and trading revenues  primarily due to losses on our tob program and high yield and structured products 
in  net interest income decreased percent to million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily driven by increased borrowing levels in in  asset management fees were million  almost all of which was generated by famco  which we acquired in september in  other income decreased to million  compared with million in  primarily due to losses recorded on our principal investments 
non interest expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase resulted from a million pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill related to our capital markets business  million of restructuring related charges and million in incremental expenses associated with famco and goldbond  which we acquired in september and october  respectively 
this increase was offset in part by a decline in compensation and benefits expenses 
consolidated non interest expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expenses  which are the largest component of our expenses  include salaries  incentive compensation  benefits  stock based compensation  employment taxes and other employee costs 
a portion of compensation expense is comprised of variable incentive arrangements  including discretionary incentive compensation  the amount of which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity  increasing with higher revenues and operating profits 
other compensation costs  primarily base salaries and benefits  are more fixed in nature 
the timing of incentive compensation payments  which generally occur in february  have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity  than is reflected in our statements of operations 
in  compensation and benefits expenses increased percent to million from million in this increase was due to higher variable compensation costs resulting from increased net revenues and profitability offset in part by cost savings associated with restructuring related activities that occurred in late and early compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues were percent for  compared with percent for at the end of  a significant portion of our guaranteed incentive compensation matured  resulting in a compensation structure that was more variable and better aligned with profitability and revenues in compensation and benefits expenses decreased percent to million in  from million in this decrease was due to lower variable compensation costs resulting from reduced net revenues and profitability partially offset by guarantees of fixed incentive compensation 
compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues were percent for  compared with percent for 
table of contents occupancy and equipment occupancy and equipment expenses were million in  compared with million in the decrease was attributable to prior investments in technology and equipment becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in base rent as a result of cost saving initiatives in in  occupancy and equipment expenses were million  compared with million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional occupancy expenses from our acquisitions of famco and goldbond in late  offset in part by a decline in base rent as we consolidated existing locations 
communications communication expenses include costs for telecommunication and data communication  primarily consisting of expenses for obtaining third party market data information 
in  communication expenses were million  compared with million in the decrease was attributable to reduced data communication expenses as a result of cost saving initiatives in and early in  communication expenses were million  essentially flat compared with floor brokerage and clearance floor brokerage and clearance expenses in decreased percent to million  compared with  due to lower regulatory assessment fees and expenses associated with accessing electronic communications networks 
in  floor brokerage and clearance expenses decreased percent to million  compared with  due to lower expenses associated with accessing electronic communications networks 
marketing and business development marketing and business development expenses include travel and entertainment and promotional and advertising costs 
in  marketing and business development expenses decreased percent to million  compared with million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to cost saving actions taken in late  as well as a decline in employee travel expenses 
additionally  in we incurred higher travel expenses associated with write offs related to equity financings that were never completed 
in  marketing and business development expenses decreased percent to million  compared with million in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of a decline in travel costs resulting from significantly lower deal activity in outside services outside services expenses include securities processing expenses  outsourced technology functions  outside legal fees and other professional fees 
in  outside services expenses decreased to million  compared with million in  primarily due to reductions in legal fees and consulting costs 
also  in we changed vendors for certain outsourced technology functions  which lowered expenses associated with those functions 
offsetting a portion of this decrease was million of legal and professional fees associated with the announced acquisition of ari 
outside services expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was primarily due to the write off of legal expenses for equity financings that were not completed because of the deterioration in the capital markets  incremental costs related to the acquisitions of famco and goldbond  and fees incurred to secure the revolving credit facility that we entered into in the first quarter of partially offsetting these increases was a decline in professional fees incurred in connection with the implementation of a new back office system 
restructuring related expense in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  primarily consisting of employee severance costs and charges related to leased office space 
during  we implemented certain expense reduction measures as a means to better align our cost infrastructure with our revenues 
this resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million in  consisting of million in severance costs resulting from a reduction of approximately employees  million related to leased office space and million of other restructuring related expenses 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing  which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to our capital markets reporting unit 
the charge primarily related to the goodwill resulting from our acquisition by us bancorp  which was retained by us when we spun off as a separate public company on december  
table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses include insurance costs  license and registration fees  expenses related to our charitable giving program  amortization of intangible assets and litigation related expenses  which consist of the amounts we reserve and or pay out related to legal and regulatory matters 
in  other operating expenses were million  essentially the same as in  other operating expenses increased to million  compared with million in this increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with famco and goldbond  which we acquired in late  as well as increased litigation related expenses 
income taxes in  our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  an effective tax rate of percent  compared with a benefit of million  an effective tax rate of percent  for  and compared with million  an effective tax rate of percent  for the increased effective tax rate in was primarily driven by a valuation reserve for net operating losses in the uk tax jurisdiction and one time tax expense items 
the decreased effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to the non taxable portion of the goodwill impairment charge related to our capital markets business

to assess the profitability of investment banking  we aggregate investment banking fees with the net interest income or expense associated with these activities 
investment banking revenues increased percent to million in  compared with million in driven by significant increases in equity financing revenues in all products 
in  equity financing revenues increased to million compared with million in as the equity capital markets were essentially on hold the second half of during  we completed equity financings  raising billion in capital  compared with equity financings in  raising billion in capital excluding the billion of capital raised from the visa initial public offering  on which we were a co lead manager 
we were the bookrunner on of these transactions in compared with in debt financing revenues in increased percent to million due to an increase in public finance revenues 
during  we completed public 
table of contents finance issues with a total par value of billion  compared with public finance issues with a total par value of billion during in  advisory services revenues decreased percent to million due to a decline in merger and acquisition activity 
during  we completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of billion  compared with transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of billion in institutional brokerage revenues comprise all the revenues generated through trading activities  which consist primarily of facilitating customer trades 
to assess the profitability of institutional brokerage activities  we aggregate institutional brokerage revenues with the net interest income or expense associated with financing  economically hedging and holding long or short inventory positions 
our results may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in trading margins  trading gains and losses  net interest spreads  trading volumes and the timing of transactions based on market opportunities 
in  institutional brokerage revenues increased percent to million  compared with million in  driven by significantly improved fixed income institutional sales and trading revenues 
equity institutional brokerage revenues decreased percent to million in  compared with the prior year 
revenues associated with the us high touch equities business were lower due to a decline in commissions per share earned and lower volumes 
fixed income institutional brokerage revenues increased significantly to million in  compared with million in  as all fixed income products produced strong revenues 
client flow business was solid across both taxable and tax exempt fixed income products 
additionally  our fixed income institutional brokerage results in benefited from favorable market conditions resulting in increased trading profits including increased profits from our municipal strategic trading activities 
we believe the favorable market conditions we experienced in will moderate in  resulting in a decline in our fixed income institutional brokerage results 
however  we expect the personnel investments we made in and plan to make in to partially offset this decline 
in  we recorded losses in high yield and structured products from lower commissions and trading losses  and losses in our discontinued tob program 
market conditions for high yield corporate bonds and structured products were especially difficult in in  asset management fees decreased to million compared with million in  due to lower assets under management as a result of reduced asset valuations 
asset management fees also include management fees from our affiliated non consolidated private equity funds 
other income loss includes gains and losses from our investments in private equity and venture capital funds  other firm investments and income associated with the forfeiture of stock based compensation 
in  other income totaled million  compared with million in in  we recorded higher income associated with the valuation of our principal investments 
industry wide market conditions eroded during  significantly reducing activity in equity financings  mergers and acquisitions and public finance 
given these challenging market conditions  investment banking revenues decreased to million in  compared with million in in  equity underwriting revenues decreased percent to million due to a decrease in the number of completed transactions 
during  we completed equity financings  raising billion in capital excluding the billion of capital raised from the visa initial public offering  on which we were a co lead manager compared with equity financings  raising billion in capital  during we were the bookrunner on of these transactions in compared with in debt financing revenues in decreased percent to million due to a decline in public finance revenues

table of contents year 
however  these gains were more than offset by losses within high yield and structured products and the tob program 
in  asset management fees increased to million compared with million in due primarily to a full year of activity in by famco  which we acquired in september asset management fees also include management fees from affiliated non consolidated private equity funds 
in  other income totaled million  compared with million in this decrease related primarily to losses associated with our investments in private equity  venture funds and other firm investments 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operating results of our pcs business and related restructuring costs 
our pcs retail brokerage business provided financial advice and a wide range of financial products and services to individual investors through a network of approximately branch offices 
the sale of the pcs branch network to ubs closed on august  we recorded million in net income in from discontinued operations and a net loss of million in we may incur discontinued operations expense or income in future periods related to changes in litigation reserve estimates for retained pcs litigation matters and for changes in estimates to occupancy and severance restructuring charges if the facts that support our estimates change 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations and restructuring activities 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  and are incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to practices within the securities industry 
the preparation of financial statements in compliance with gaap and industry practices requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require us to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by us to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical  including whether the estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information eg third party or independent sources  the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be used under gaap 
for a full description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are our critical accounting policies 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  securitized municipal tender option bonds and certain firm investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
when available  we use observable market prices  observable market parameters  or broker or dealer prices bid and ask prices to derive the fair value of the instrument 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market 
table of contents prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time 
ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
results from valuation models and other valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of the future period fair value measurement 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of such financial instruments are the cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar quality and yield  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
even where the value of a security is derived from an independent source  certain assumptions may be required to determine the security s fair value 
for example  we assume that the size of positions that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current estimated fair value 
derivatives are valued using pricing models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
management deemed the net present value of estimated future cash flows model to be the best estimate of fair value as most of our derivative products are interest rate products 
the valuation models used require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves and measures of volatility 
the valuation models are monitored over the life of the derivative product 
if there are any changes in the underlying inputs  the model is updated for those new inputs 
fasb accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to inputs with little or no pricing observability level iii measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
instruments that trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified within level iii based on the results of our price verification process 
the company s level iii assets were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented approximately percent and percent of financial instruments measured at fair value 
at december   this balance primarily consisted of asset backed securities  principally collateralized by aircraft and residential mortgages  that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions  such that unobservable inputs had to be utilized for the fair value measurements and auction rate securities related to lower credit issuers for which the market has remained illiquid 
asset backed securities collateralized with residential mortgages are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs that include credit default rates 
asset backed securities collateralized with airplane leases are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs including utilization rates  trust costs  aircraft residual values and assumptions on timing of costs 
auction rate securities are valued based upon our 
table of contents expectations of issuer refunding plans and using internal models 
we could experience reductions in the value of these inventory positions  which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
during  we recorded net purchases of million of level iii assets  primarily consisting of million of net purchases of asset backed securities offset in part with million in net sales of corporate bonds 
we had net transfers of million of assets from level iii to level ii in and million of net transfers of assets from level ii to level iii 
transfers of assets from level iii to level ii were primarily related to convertible securities transaction activity as liquidity increased and external prices became more observable and asset backed securities where pricing information and recently executed transactions provided transparency for purposes of fair value 
in  net gains realized and unrealized on level iii assets of million were attributed to increased fair values of certain asset backed securities and certain principal investments 
during  we recorded net purchases of million of level iii liabilities related to fixed income and asset backed securities made to facilitate customer activity 
we had million of liabilities transfer from level iii to level ii  related to asset backed securities 
our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized decreased level iii liabilities by million 
financial instruments carried at contract amounts have short term maturities one year or less  are repriced frequently or bear market interest rates and  accordingly  the carrying amount of those contracts approximate fair value 
financial instruments carried at contract amounts on our consolidated statements of financial condition include receivables from and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations  securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  receivables from and payables to customers and short term financing 
goodwill and intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million 
of this goodwill balance  million is a result of the acquisition by us bancorp of our predecessor  piper jaffray companies inc  and its subsidiaries 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist that could indicate possible impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our two principal reporting units capital markets and asset management based on the following factors our market capitalization  a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
valuation multiples may be based on revenues  price to earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and business segments 
these multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences including size  operating leverage and other factors 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are compared with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as noted above  the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and the subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets or businesses will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
our estimated cash flows typically extend for five years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended time period 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces and changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  discount rates and market conditions 
to assess the reasonableness of cash flow estimates and validate assumptions used in our estimates  we review historical 
table of contents performance of the underlying assets or similar assets 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and our industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november   and no impairment was identified 
in addition  we tested the definite lived intangible assets acquired as part of the famco acquisition and concluded there was no impairment 
in  our annual goodwill impairment testing resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the charge related to our capital markets reporting unit and primarily pertained to goodwill created from the acquisition of our predecessor  piper jaffray companies inc  and its subsidiaries by us bancorp  which was retained by us when we spun off from us bancorp on december  the impairment charge resulted from deteriorating economic and market conditions in  which led to reduced valuations in the factors used in the annual impairment test discussed above 
stock based compensation as part of our compensation to employees and directors  we use stock based compensation  consisting of restricted stock and stock options 
the company accounts for equity awards in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statements of operations at grant date fair value over the service period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures 
compensation paid to employees in the form of restricted stock or stock options is generally accrued or amortized on a straight line basis over the required service period of the award and is included in our results of operations as compensation expense 
the majority of these awards have a three year cliff vesting schedule 
the majority of our restricted stock and option grants provide for continued vesting after termination  so long as the employee does not violate certain post termination restrictions as set forth in the award agreements or any agreements entered into upon termination 
these post termination restrictions do not meet the criteria for an in substance service condition as defined by asc accordingly  such restricted stock and option grants are expensed in the period in which those awards are deemed to be earned  which is generally the calendar year preceding our annual february equity grant 
if any of these awards are cancelled  the lower of the fair value at grant date or the fair value at the date of cancellation is recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
performance based restricted stock awards granted are amortized on a straight line basis over the period we expect the performance target to be met 
the performance condition must be met for the awards to vest and total compensation cost will be recognized only if the performance condition is satisfied 
the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and that the awards will vest is reevaluated each reporting period with changes in actual or estimated compensation expense accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment 
stock based compensation granted to our non employee directors is in the form of unrestricted common shares of piper jaffray companies stock 
stock based compensation paid to directors is immediately expensed and is included in our results of operations as outside services expense as of the date of grant 
we granted stock options in fiscal years through in determining the estimated fair value of stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires management to exercise judgment with respect to certain assumptions  including the expected dividend yield  the expected volatility  and the expected life of the options 
the expected dividend yield assumption was derived from the assumed dividend payout over the expected life of the option 
the expected volatility assumption for the and option grants was derived from a combination of our historical data and industry comparisons  as we had limited information on which to base our volatility estimates because we have only been a public company since the beginning of the expected volatility assumption for grants prior to december  were based solely on industry comparisons 
the expected life of options assumption was derived from the average of the following two factors industry comparisons and the guidance provided by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab allows the use of an acceptable methodology under which we can take the midpoint of the vesting date and the full 
table of contents contractual term 
we believe our approach for calculating an expected life to be an appropriate method in light of the limited historical data regarding employee exercise behavior or employee post termination behavior 
additional information regarding assumptions used in the black scholes pricing model can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
as part of the asset purchase agreement for the sale of our pcs branch network to ubs that closed in august  we have retained liabilities arising from regulatory matters and certain pcs litigation arising prior to the sale 
adjustments to litigation reserves for matters pertaining to the pcs business are included within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
given the uncertainties regarding timing  size  volume and outcome of pending and potential legal proceedings and other factors  the amounts of reserves are difficult to determine and of necessity subject to future revision 
subject to the foregoing  we believe  based on our current knowledge  after appropriate consultation with outside legal counsel and after taking into account our established reserves  that pending litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings will be resolved with no material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  if  during any period  a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves  the results of operations in that period could be materially adversely affected 
income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return  which includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries 
we also are subject to income tax in various states and municipalities and those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in reporting certain items  principally  amortization of share based compensation 
the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we believe that our future taxable profits will be sufficient to recognize our us deferred tax assets 
if however  our projections of future taxable profits do not materialize  we may conclude that a valuation allowance is needed 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to foreign subsidiary net operating loss carry forwards 
we record deferred tax benefits for future tax deductions expected upon the vesting of share based compensation 
if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation ie  the value of the share based compensation at the time of vesting exceed the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting ie  the grant date fair value of the compensation computed in accordance with asc  we record the excess tax benefit as additional paid in capital 
conversely  if deductions reported on our tax return for share based 
table of contents compensation are less than the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting  we offset the deficiency first to any previously recognized excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital and any remaining deficiency is recorded as income tax expense 
as of december   we do not have any available excess tax benefits within additional paid in capital 
approximately  shares of restricted stock vested in the first quarter of at values less than the grant date fair value resulting in million of income tax expense in the first quarter of we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes when  it is not more likely than not that a certain position or component of a position will be ultimately upheld by the relevant taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
our tax provision and related accruals include the impact of estimates for uncertain tax positions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
to the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such change in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period of change 
liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity is of critical importance to us given the nature of our business 
insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to  and may be the cause of  financial institution failure 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions  and we have implemented a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances  although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances 
the majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions 
receivables and payables with customers and brokers and dealers usually settle within a few days 
as part of our liquidity strategy  we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible and maximize our lower cost financing alternatives 
our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations  equity capital  and other short term funding arrangements 
the fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are directly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses 
certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions  requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results 
a significant component of our employees compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation 
the timing of these incentive compensation payments  which generally are made in february  has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity when paid 
we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to in the foreseeable future 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock  which expires on june  in  we repurchased million  or  shares  of our common stock 
as a result of this repurchase and prior repurchases  million of our authorization remains as of december  cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from operating activities used million of cash due primarily to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
in  we significantly decreased our inventory positions owned to reduce our market exposure 
in late  as the market environment improved  we began to bring our inventory to more normalized levels 
investing activities used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was provided through financing activities due in part to the issuance of variable rate senior notes in the amount of million and commercial paper in the amount of million during the additional cash provided by the issuance of variable rate senior notes and commercial paper reduced the need to enter into repurchase agreements at december   resulting in a million decrease in cash inflows related to repurchase agreements 
additionally  million was utilized to repurchase common stock 

table of contents in the first quarter of  we expect a decrease in our overall cash position and an increase in short term financing related to the closing of the ari acquisition 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from operating activities provided cash of million due to cash received from a reduction in net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned as we reduced our inventory positions during to reduce our market exposure 
partially offsetting this fluctuation was our net operating loss 
investing activities used million of cash for the payment to the former owners of famco in accordance with performance conditions set forth in the purchase agreement and the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was used in financing activities due in part to a million decrease in secured financing activities and million utilized to repurchase common stock 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from we increased our cash position at the end of to facilitate liquidity in the event of any credit tightness in the markets at or near year end 
operating activities provided cash of million due to cash received from earnings and a reduction in operating assets 
investing activities used million of cash for the acquisitions of famco and goldbond during and the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was provided through financing activities due to a million increase in secured financing activities offset in part by million utilized to repurchase common stock 
funding sources short term financing short term financing is obtained primarily through the use of repurchase agreements  securities lending arrangements  commercial paper issuance and bank lines of credit and are typically collateralized by the firm s securities inventory 
in addition  we have established arrangements to obtain financing by another broker dealer at the end of each business day related specifically to our convertible inventory 
short term financing is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate and or the london interbank offer rate 
we have available both committed and uncommitted short term financing with a diverse group of banks 
uncommitted lines we use uncommitted lines in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under our uncommitted lines varies daily based on our funding needs 
our uncommitted secured lines total million with three banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral  as determined by the bank agreement  to secure an advance under the line 
collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under these secured lines 
we also have a million uncommitted unsecured facility with one of these banks 
these uncommitted lines are discretionary and are not a commitment by the bank to provide an advance under the line 
these lines are subject to approval by the respective bank each time an advance is requested and advances may be denied 
we manage our relationships with the banks that provide these uncommitted facilities in order to have appropriate levels of funding for our business 
at december   we had million outstanding against these lines of credit 
committed lines our committed line is a million revolving secured credit facility 
we use this credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under the facility varies daily based on our funding needs 
advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities 
the facility includes a covenant that requires our us broker dealer subsidiary to maintain a minimum net capital of million  and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on september  at december   we had no advances against our committed line of credit 
commercial paper program on december   we initiated a secured commercial paper program to fund a portion of our securities inventories 
the maximum amount that may be issued under the program is million  of which million is outstanding at december  the commercial paper notes are secured by our securities inventory with maturities on the commercial paper ranging from days to days from date of issuance 
to finance customer and trade related receivables we utilized an average of million in short term bank loans and an average of million in securities lending arrangements during this compares to an average of 
table of contents million in short term bank loans and no securities lending arrangements during average net repurchase agreements excluding repurchase agreements used to facilitate economic hedges of million and million during and  respectively  were primarily used to finance inventory 
in addition  on december  we initiated a million commercial paper program  of which million was outstanding at december  the decrease in average financing agreements in was primarily a result of lower average inventory balances as we significantly reduced our inventory balances in late to reduce market exposure and did not start increasing net inventory balances again until late growth in our securities inventory is generally financed through a combination of our various short term financing arrangements 
variable rate senior notes on december   we issued variable rate senior notes notes in the amount of million 
the initial holders of the notes are certain entities advised by pacific investment management company llc pimco 
the proceeds from the notes will be used to fund a portion of the ari acquisition  discussed above under executive overview 
the unpaid principal amount of the notes will be due on december  we currently do not have a credit rating  which may adversely affect our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs by limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing funds 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the contractual amounts at december   in total and by remaining maturity 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including secured financing transactions  trading liabilities  short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities 
through through and thereafter total dollars in millions operating lease obligations purchase commitments fund commitments a loan commitments b famco contingent consideration c a the fund commitments have no specified call dates  however  the investment period for these funds is through the timing of capital calls is based on market conditions and investment opportunities 
b we commit to short term bridge loan financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite debt 
we are unable to estimate the timing on the funding of these commitments 
c the acquisition of famco included the potential for additional cash consideration to be paid in the form of three annual payments contingent upon revenue exceeding certain revenue run rate thresholds 
the amount of the three annual payments assuming the revenue run rate threshold has been met will be equal to a percentage of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization for the previous year 
we made a payment of additional cash consideration of million in and accrued million related to we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the amount of the annual payment  if any 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase obligations contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 

table of contents the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member firm of finra  our us broker dealer subsidiary is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the sec and the net capital rule of finra 
we have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule  which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of the greater of million or percent of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions  as this is defined in the rule 
finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying dividends if resulting net capital would be less than percent of aggregate debit balances 
advances to affiliates  repayment of subordinated liabilities  dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain notification and other provisions of the uniform net capital rule and the net capital rule of finra 
we expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations 
we also are subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital from our broker dealer subsidiary 
at december   our net capital under the sec s uniform net capital rule was million  and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the sec rule by million 
although we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by finra and the sec  a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our revenue producing activities 
piper jaffray ltd  our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the united kingdom  is subject to the capital requirements of the uk financial services authority 
each of our piper jaffray asia entities licensed by the hong kong securities and futures commission is subject to the liquid capital requirements of the securities and futures financial resources rule promulgated under the securities and futures ordinance 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements at december  and total expiration per period at december  contractual amount at december  later dollars in thousands matched book derivative contracts derivative contracts excluding matched book derivatives securitization transactions derivative contracts loan commitments private equity and other principal investments consists of interest rate swaps 
we have minimal market risk related to these matched book derivative contracts  however  we do have counterparty risk with two major financial institutions  which are mitigated by collateral deposits 
in addition  we have a limited number of counterparties contractual amount of million at december  who are not required to post collateral 
based on market movements  the 
table of contents uncollateralized amounts representing the fair value of the derivative contract can become material  exposing us to the credit risk of these counterparties 
at december   we had million of credit exposure with these counterparties  including million of credit exposure with one counterparty 
we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional or contract amount overstates the expected payout 
at december  and  the net fair value of these derivative contracts approximated million and million  respectively 
derivatives derivatives notional contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
rather  the market value  or fair value  of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  as applicable 
derivatives are presented on a net basis by counterparty when a legal right of offset exists and on a net basis by cross product when applicable provisions are stated in a master netting agreement 
we enter into derivative contracts in a principal capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients 
we also use derivative products to hedge the interest rate and market value risks associated with our security positions 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative products  see note  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments we may commit to short term bridge loan financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite corporate debt 
we had million in loan commitments outstanding at december  private equity and other principal investments we have committed capital to certain non consolidated private equity funds 
these commitments have no specified call dates 
we had million of fund commitments outstanding at december  special purpose entities we enter into arrangements with various special purpose entities spes 
spes may be corporations  trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose 
there are two types of spes qualified spes qspes and variable interest entities vies 
a qspe generally can be described as an entity whose permitted activities are limited to passively holding financial assets and distributing cash flows to investors based on pre set terms 
spes that do not meet the qspe criteria because their permitted activities are not limited sufficiently or control remains with one of the owners are referred to as vies 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic  consolidation  we consolidate a vie if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that either i absorbs a majority of the vies expected losses  ii receives a majority of the vies expected residual returns  or iii both 
as of december   we have investments in various entities  typically partnerships or limited liability companies  established for the purpose of investing in private or public equity securities and various partnership entities 
we commit capital or act as the managing partner or member of these entities 
some of these entities are deemed to be vies

table of contents enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business 
in the course of conducting business operations  we are exposed to a variety of risks 
market risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal  regulatory and compliance risk  and reputational risk are the principal risks we face in operating our business 
we seek to identify  assess and monitor each risk in accordance with defined policies and procedures 
the extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
with respect to market risk and credit risk  the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders  trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions and overall risk profile 
our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis 
the broader goals of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area  to consolidate risk monitoring company wide  to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies  to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management  and to ensure accurate mark to market pricing 
in addition to supporting daily risk management processes on the trading desks  our risk management functions support our market and credit risk committee 
this committee oversees risk management practices  including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies 
market risk market risk represents the risk of financial volatility that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients  to our market making activities and our proprietary activities 
market risks are inherent to both cash and derivative financial instruments 
the scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market sensitive financial instruments 
our different types of market risk include interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  changes in credit spreads  and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of appropriate hedging in us government securities  agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  interest rate swaps  options  futures and forward contracts 
we utilize interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our fixed income inventory and to hedge rate lock agreements and forward bond purchase agreements we may enter into with our public finance customers 
additionally  we historically used interest rate swap agreements to hedge residual cash flows from our tender option bond program 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
these interest rate swap contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
equity price risk equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices 
we are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities in the us and european markets on both listed and over the counter equity markets 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on the notional level of our inventory and by managing net position levels with those limits 
currency risk currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 

table of contents value at risk value at risk var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we perform a daily var analysis on substantially all of our trading positions  including fixed income  equities  convertible bonds  exchange traded options  and all associated economic hedges 
these positions encompass both customer related activities and proprietary investments 
we use a var model because it provides a common metric for assessing market risk across business lines and products 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of risk exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes and individual securities 
we use a monte carlo simulation methodology for var calculations 
we believe this methodology provides var results that properly reflect the risk profile of all our instruments  including those that contain optionality and accurately models correlation movements among all of our asset classes 
in addition  it provides improved tail results as there are no assumptions of distribution  and can add additional insight for scenario shock analysis 
model based var derived from simulation has inherent limitations including reliance on historical data to predict future market risk  var calculated using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the modeling of the market risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table quantifies the model based var simulated for each component of market risk for the periods presented computed using the past days of historical data 
when calculating var we use a percent confidence level and a one day time horizon 
this means that  over time  there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any given day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the var amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in a day trading period 
at december  dollars in thousands interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 

table of contents we view average var over a period of time as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
the table below illustrates the daily high  low and average value at risk calculated for each component of market risk during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
because high and low var numbers for these risk categories may have occurred on different days  high and low numbers for diversification benefit would not be meaningful 
trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on five occasions during the aggregate var as of december  was lower compared to levels reported as of december  this is due to reductions in our municipal tender option bonds and fixed income high yield inventories  as well as lower realized volatility over the prior year 
in addition to var  we also employ additional measures to monitor and manage market risk exposure including the following net market position  duration exposure  option sensitivities  and inventory turnover 
all metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals 
liquidity risk market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
depending on the specific security  the structure of the financial product  and or overall market conditions  we may be forced to hold onto a security for substantially longer than we had planned 
our inventory positions subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk in our day to day funding activities 
we have a relatively low leverage ratio of as of december  we calculate our leverage ratio by dividing total assets by total shareholders equity 
our us broker dealer has net capital of million in as of december  we manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products 
for example  our treasury department actively manages the use of repurchase agreements  securities lending arrangements  commercial paper issuance and secured and unsecured bank borrowings each day depending on pricing  availability of funding  available collateral and lending parameters from any one of these sources 
we also added a committed bank line to our funding sources during to further manage liquidity risk  which we renewed in september in addition to managing our capital and funding  the treasury department oversees the management of net interest income risk and the overall use of our capital  funding  and balance sheet 

table of contents we currently act as the remarketing agent for approximately billion of variable rate demand notes  all of which have a financial institution providing a liquidity guarantee 
as remarketing agent for our clients variable rate demand notes  we are the first source of liquidity for sellers of these instruments 
at certain times  demand from buyers of variable rate demand notes is less than the supply generated by sellers of these instruments 
in times of supply and demand imbalance  we may but are not obligated to facilitate liquidity by purchasing variable rate demand notes from sellers for our own account 
our liquidity risk related to variable rate demand notes is ultimately mitigated by our ability to tender these securities back to the financial institution providing the liquidity guarantee 
credit risk credit risk in our business arises from potential non performance by counterparties  customers  borrowers or issuers of securities we hold in our trading inventory 
the global credit crisis also has created increased credit risk  particularly counterparty risk  as the interconnectedness of the financial markets has caused market participants to be impacted by systemic pressure  or contagion  that results from the failure or expected failure of large market participants 
we have concentrated counterparty credit exposure with six non publicly rated entities totaling million at december  this counterparty credit exposure is part of our derivative program  consisting primarily of interest rate swaps 
one derivative counterparty represents percent  or million  of this exposure 
credit exposure associated with our derivative counterparties is driven by uncollateralized market movements in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts and is monitored regularly by our market and credit risk committee 
we are exposed to credit risk in our role as a trading counterparty to dealers and customers  as a holder of securities and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement and financing of various transactions 
client activities are transacted on a delivery versus payment  cash or margin basis 
our credit exposure to institutional client business is mitigated by the use of industry standard delivery versus payment through depositories and clearing banks 
credit exposure associated with our customer margin accounts in the us and hong kong is monitored daily 
our risk management functions have created credit risk policies establishing appropriate credit limits and collateralization thresholds for our customers utilizing margin lending 
credit exposure associated with our bridge loan financings is monitored regularly by our market and credit risk committee 
bridge loan financings that have been funded are recorded in other assets at amortized cost on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
at december   we had funded three bridge loan financings totaling million and one committed  but unfunded bridge loan totaling million 
our risk management functions review risk associated with institutional counterparties with whom we hold repurchase and resale agreement facilities  stock borrow or loan facilities  derivatives  tbas and other documented institutional counterparty agreements that may give rise to credit exposure 
counterparty levels are established relative to the level of counterparty ratings and potential levels of activity 
we are subject to credit concentration risk if we hold large individual securities positions  execute large transactions with individual counterparties or groups of related counterparties  extend large loans to individual borrowers or make substantial underwriting commitments 
concentration risk can occur by industry  geographic area or type of client 
potential credit concentration risk is carefully monitored and is managed through the use of policies and limits 
we also are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in the credit spreads of debt instruments 
credit spread risk arises from potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or the market s perception of the issuer s credit worthiness 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
we rely on the ability of our employees  our internal systems and processes and systems at computer centers operated by third parties to process a large number of transactions 
in 
table of contents the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our systems or processes or improper action by our employees or third party vendors  we could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation 
we have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company wide basis  and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operations policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
legal  regulatory and compliance risk legal  regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have established procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  those related to regulatory net capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  credit extension  money laundering  privacy and recordkeeping 
we have established internal policies relating to ethics and business conduct  and compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  as well as training and other procedures designed to ensure that these policies are followed 
reputation and other risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is critical 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the conduct of our business activities and the types of clients and counterparties with whom we conduct business 
we seek to maintain our reputation by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards and performing appropriate reviews of clients and counterparties 
effects of inflation because our assets are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
