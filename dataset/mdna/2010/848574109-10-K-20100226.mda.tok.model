this discussion contains forward looking statements that must be understood in the context of numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this annual report 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
our results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
recent events on february   the company announced that philip anderson was appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer of spirit holdings 
on february   spirit also entered into a new employment agreement with mr 
anderson 
on february   boeing completed the first flight of the b on december   boeing completed the first flight of the b jetliner  marking a significant milestone in the program 
this was followed by the completion of initial airworthiness testing on january  on october   our engineers represented by the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace wichita engineering unit speea approved a new union contract effective through december  overview we are the largest independent non oem original equipment manufacturer aircraft parts designer and manufacturer of commercial aerostructures in the world  based on annual revenues  as well as the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to boeing 
in addition  we are one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to airbus 
boeing and airbus are the two largest aircraft oems in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which includes forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which includes nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components  and wing systems  which includes wings  wing components  flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts 
this segment manufactures products at our facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma  prestwick  scotland and subang  malaysia 
all other activities fall within the all other segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other companies that have operations in wichita 
fuselage systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the global industry contracted significantly in and in for both passenger air traffic and cargo freight  but is beginning to show signs of stabilization 
near term challenges include economic weakness in the airline industry and continuing turmoil in global credit markets  which may lead to increased aircraft order cancellations and deferrals as well as customer difficulty in obtaining financing for large purchases  and ongoing pressure by airlines to cut capacity by canceling some routes  limiting flight frequencies  and parking aircraft all contributing to a further softening demand for new aircraft 
to date  both boeing and airbus have been able to avoid major production and delivery slowdowns by finding replacement customers for deferred or cancelled aircraft 
possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts in the middle east  terrorist attacks against the industry  or a pandemic health crisis also have the potential to cause precipitous declines in air traffic 

table of contents demand for commercial aerostructures is highly correlated to demand for new aircraft 
from through  boeing and airbus experienced an unprecedented order intake and backlog growth 
in that period  the two manufacturers obtained combined total gross orders of approximately  aircraft 
their aggregate backlog increased from nearly  to over  aircraft 
however  largely due to declining demand for commercial air travel including both passenger and freight activity  annual commercial net orders fell to in  which was lower than deliveries for that year  resulting in a decrease in aggregate backlog 
despite the order slowdown  high backlog levels are expected to continue to drive stable production and delivery forecasts in the near term from both boeing and airbus 
if the commercial backlog were to continue to decline  there could be a resulting near term impact on production rates 
if production rates fell  we would take actions to reduce costs and limit capital spending to mitigate the resulting loss of revenues and production base 
the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through and delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced that it expects its deliveries to be between we expect airbus deliveries to be approximately in inventory continues to grow both in terms of absolute dollars as well as a percentage of total assets 
inventory as a percentage of total assets was  and at december    and  respectively 
this overall trend in inventory is driven primarily by our contractually required investments in new programs which include the boeing b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for an increase in inventory from to of million  net of the million forward loss provision recorded in the second quarter of on our gulfstream g contract 
the remaining contracts  primarily for boeing and airbus programs  contributed only million to the increase in inventory 
the increases in inventory for new programs in the last few years are a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting with regard to inventory and revenue recognition 
under this method  investments in new contracts  including contractual pre production costs and recurring production costs in excess of the projected average cost to manufacture all units in the contract block  initially accumulate in inventory for the related contract 
once production has reached a point where the cost to produce a ship set falls below such projected average cost  the inventory balance for such program will begin to decrease 
as many of our new programs are either in the pre production phase or the early stages of recurring production  we expect that inventory balances will continue to increase in deferred inventory costs are evaluated for recoverability through their inclusion in the total costs used in the calculation of each contract s estimated profit margin 
when the estimated total contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues  an inventory reserve is established 
new program performance we are currently performing work on several new programs  which are in various stages of development 
several of these programs entered flight testing during the fourth quarter of  including the boeing b  gulfstream g  and gulfstream g which includes the rolls royce br and we expect to deliver revenue generating production units for all of these programs in in addition  we are working on the new boeing derivative the  which entered flight testing in february of historically  low rate production commences during flight testing  followed by an increase to full rate production  assuming that successful testing and certification are achieved 
accordingly  we anticipate that each of these programs will begin generating full rate production level revenues between and the boeing b is the only new program that is expected to have a material impact on our net revenues 
we are still in the early development stages for the airbus a xwb  bombardier cseries and mitsubishi mrj programs  as these aircraft are not scheduled to enter service until or later 
transition of each of these programs from development to recurring production levels is dependent upon the success of each program at achieving flight testing and certification  as well as the ability of the oem to generate acceptable levels of aircraft sales 

table of contents fiscal year was a challenging year for certain of our new programs 
while work progressed as anticipated on the airbus a xwb  bombardier cseries and mitsubishi mrj programs  we experienced difficulties in achieving estimated cost targets on certain other programs  particularly in the areas of engineering and estimated recurring costs 
as described in more detail in results of operations  we recorded a million forward loss on our g wing and tooling contracts in the second quarter of we may experience additional cost pressures on this program in the future as we progress through the flight testing and certification phases 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on our sikorsky ch k contract because of additional cost to support a weight improvement plan 
while our estimates for this contract continue to show positive margins  it also faces the potential of additional cost growth as we progress through the systems development and demonstration phase 
in  cessna cancelled further development of the citation columbus business jet and terminated our contract to supply the fuselage and empennage for this program 
at the time  we recorded a million charge to reflect the estimated impact of this termination 
we remain at risk of future charges on this program pending resolution of spirit s contract termination claims seeking recovery of costs incurred 
we have also experienced cost overruns during the development phase of the rolls royce br program 
under our contract with rolls royce  we have been engaged to design  develop and manufacture nacelles for the br engine on the gulfstream g over the life of the program 
the contract provides for fixed prices for a period of time  subject thereafter to adjustment 
the higher than expected spending on the br program has resulted in an estimated margin of zero  with additional potential future cost pressures as well as opportunities for improved performance 
although the g wing contract is progressing  it is also experiencing cost pressures stemming from higher than anticipated engineering effort as well as design changes 
while we still estimate positive margins for this contract  risks related to additional engineering as well as the recurring cost profile remain as this program enters flight testing 
we seek additional consideration for customer work statement changes throughout the development process as a standard course of business 
the ability to recover or negotiate additional consideration is not certain and varies by contract 
varying market conditions for these products may also impact future profitability 
although none of these new programs other than the b individually are expected to have a material impact on our net revenues  they do have the potential  either individually or in the aggregate  to materially and negatively impact our consolidated results of operations if future changes in estimates result in the need for a forward loss provision 
absent any such loss provisions  we do not anticipate that any of these new programs other than the b will significantly dilute our future consolidated margins 
as the b approaches full rate production  it may adversely impact our consolidated margins 
outlook we expect the following results  or ranges of results  for the year ending december  outlook actuals revenues billion billion earnings per share  fully diluted per share per share cash flow from operations million million capital expenditures million million customer reimbursement n a million our outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect our revenues to be between and billion based on boeing s delivery guidance of aircraft  anticipated b deliveries  expected airbus deliveries in of approximately aircraft  internal spirit forecasts for non oem production activity and other customers  and foreign exchange rates consistent with fourth quarter levels 
we expect our fully diluted earnings per share to be between and per share reflecting margin headwind in the next contract accounting blocks driven by volume and model mix  increased depreciation expense  lower pension income  and increased interest expense 

table of contents we expect our cash flow from operations  less capital expenditures  to be approximately a million use of cash in the aggregate  which includes capital expenditures of approximately million 
planned capital expenditures in include approximately million of tooling associated with the airbus a xwb program 
risks to our financial guidance include reduced demand for our core products  higher than forecasted costs to develop new programs  our ability to achieve anticipated productivity and cost improvements  unfavorable resolution of certain b assertions  and labor negotiations 
basis of presentation the financial statements include spirit s financial statements and the financial statements of its majority owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
investments in business entities in which the company does not have control  but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies generally to ownership  are accounted for by the equity method 
kansas industrial energy supply company kiesc  a tenancy in common with other wichita companies established to purchase natural gas  is fully consolidated as spirit owns of the entity s equity 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
spirit s uk subsidiary uses local currency  the british pound  as its functional currency 
all other foreign subsidiaries use local currency as their functional currency with the exception of our malaysian subsidiary  which uses the british pound  and our french subsidiary  which uses the us dollar 
as part of the monthly consolidation process  the functional currency is translated to us dollars using the end of month currency translation rate for balance sheet accounts and average period currency translation rates for revenue and income accounts as defined by fasb authoritative guidance on foreign currency translation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of the company s revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
the company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones or use of the cost to cost method  that are indicative of our progress toward completion depending on facts and circumstances 
we follow the requirements of fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 

table of contents under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates are recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs of a contract 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the contract 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin contract block is predicated upon contractual terms and market forecasts 
the assumed timeframe period covered by the contract block is generally equal to the period specified in the contract or the future timeframe for which we can project reasonably dependable cost estimates 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contracts span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenues earned from providing maintenance services including any contracted research and development are recognized when the service is complete or other contractual milestones are attained 
since boeing retained title to tooling assets and provides such tooling to the company at no cost  the company treats the amortization of boeing owned tooling as a reduction to revenues as required by fasb authoritative guidance on consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including resellers of the vendor s product 
these items are netted against gross revenues in calculating net revenues 
new programs a significant portion of the company s future revenues is expected to be derived from new programs  most notably the b  on which we may be contracted to provide design and engineering services  recurring production  or both 
there are several risks inherent to such new programs 
in the design and engineering phase  we may incur costs in excess of our forecasts due to several factors  including cost overruns  customer directed change orders and delays in the overall program 
we may also incur higher than expected recurring production costs  which may be caused by a variety of factors  including the future impact of engineering changes or other change orders or our inability to secure contracts with our suppliers at projected cost levels 
our ability to recover these excess costs from the customer will depend on several factors  including our rights under our contracts for the new programs 
in determining our profits and losses in accordance with the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs  as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables 
we continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience 
if we make material changes to our assumptions  such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors  an increase in future production costs or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs  we may experience negative cumulative catch up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized 
in some cases  we may recognize forward loss amounts 
for a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new programs  see risk factors risk factors related to our business and industry 

table of contents inventory raw materials are stated at lower of cost principally on an actual or average cost basis or market 
inventoried costs attributed to units delivered under long term contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining revenues of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period the loss becomes known  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
costs in inventory include amounts relating to contracts with long production cycles  some of which are not expected to be realized within one year 
the company reviews its general stock materials and spare parts inventory each quarter to identify impaired inventory  including excess or obsolete inventory  based on historical sales trends and expected production usage 
impaired inventories are written off in the period identified 
finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized 
tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for tax credits 
under this method  tax credits reduce income tax expense 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on employers accounting for pensions  post retirement benefits other than pensions  defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 

table of contents assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted fasb authoritative guidance which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours  which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans that include restricted share grants and restricted stock units

for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for boeing aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for airbus aircraft in a given period  the term ship set 
table of contents refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
other components which are part of the same aircraft ship sets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or ship set deliveries  which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various ship set components in any given period 
comparative ship set deliveries by model are as follows twelve months twelve months twelve months ended ended ended december  december  december  model b b b b b total boeing a family a a total airbus hawker series total spirit net revenues by prime customer are as follows twelve months twelve months twelve months ended ended ended december  december  december  prime customer dollars in millions boeing airbus sikorsky hawker beechcraft other total net revenues g forward loss charge in the second quarter of  we recorded a million forward loss charge for the gulfstream g g business jet program 
under our contract for this program  we have the exclusive right to design  develop and manufacture wing components over the life of the program 
the contract provides for fixed prices  which are subject to annual formulaic adjustments based on changes in certain specified cost indices 
in addition  the g contract requires us to fund certain up front development expenses 
the g program charge resulted from the combination of higher than anticipated non recurring costs  increased forecasted costs on recurring production and a decrease in the estimated number of units to be produced over which the increased non recurring costs will be spread 
the increases in costs were driven by several factors  including changing technical requirements  overspending on the design and engineering phase of the program and uncertainty in our ability to secure long term contracts with suppliers at projected cost levels 
the decrease in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract was due to deterioration in the global economy and decreasing demand for mid sized business jets 
further cost increases or an inability to meet revised recurring cost forecasts on the g program 
table of contents may result in additional forward loss reserves in future periods  while improvements in future costs compared to current estimates may result in favorable adjustments if forward loss reserves are no longer required 
twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december   were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with net revenues of  million for the prior year 
the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in ship set deliveries for large commercial aircraft caused in part by the reduction in deliveries in that resulted from the iam strike at boeing 
ship set deliveries to boeing increased to ship sets during the twelve months ended december   compared to ship sets in ship set deliveries for airbus increased to ship sets during the twelve months ended december   compared to ship sets in in total  for the twelve months ended december   we delivered  ship sets compared to ship sets delivered in  a increase 
approximately of spirit s net revenues for the twelve months ended december  came from our two largest customers  boeing and airbus 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the prior year 
the increase in cost of sales in was due primarily to several unusual charges recorded in the second quarter  including a million forward loss charge for the gulfstream g business jet program and the million impact of the cessna citation columbus termination 
during  spirit updated its contract profitability estimates resulting in aggregate unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments of million related to periods prior to to reflect  among other things  post strike production ramp up as a result of the iam strike at boeing  nutplate rework  transition to a new enterprise resource planning erp system  higher than forecasted costs on contract blocks completed in december and higher than expected costs on the sikorsky ch k program 
unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments totaling million were recorded in related to periods prior to  driven primarily by lower forecasted pension income and impact of the iam strike at boeing 
sg a  research and development 
combined sg a  research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues were and for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively  despite lower net revenues in as a result of the iam strike at boeing 
sg a expenses for the twelve months ended december   were lower as a percentage of net revenues due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation and lower stock compensation expenses 
in  we recognized million in stock compensation expense in sg a as compared to million in research and development costs for were million as compared to million in due to an increase in b derivative activities and a tooling activities 
operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating income of million for the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to unusual charges incurred in the second quarter of  including a million forward loss charge for the gulfstream g business jet program  the million impact of the cessna citation columbus termination  and the realization of larger unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments totaling million related to periods prior to  partially offset by increased delivery rates for large commercial aircraft 
interest expense and financing fee amortization 
interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended december   includes million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs  as compared to million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense associated with long term debt in was primarily driven by interest related to the senior unsecured bonds that we issued at the end of the third quarter of  partially offset by lower libor rates on the floating portion of our term b loan 
the increase in deferred financing costs was a result of increased amortized costs associated with the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility 
interest income 
interest income for the twelve months ended december   consisted of million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable from boeing for capital expense reimbursement pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the boeing acquisition and million of interest income compared to 
table of contents million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable and million of interest income for the prior year 
the decrease of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to lower accretion income as a result of a lower outstanding balance on the discounted long term receivable which was collected in full in december and lower interest rates on interest bearing accounts 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises 
events or items that give rise to discrete recognition could include finalizing audit examinations for open tax years  a statute of limitations expiration  or a stock acquisition 
the income tax provision for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to million for the prior year 
the effective tax rate was as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate recorded for is related primarily to additional us federal research and experimentation tax credits 
the decrease from the us statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the us federal research and experimentation tax credit and the qualified domestic production activities deduction

liquidity and capital resources liquidity  or access to cash  is an important factor in determining our financial stability 
the primary sources of our liquidity include cash flow from operations  which may include advance payments and payments from customers  as well as governmental grants  borrowing capacity through our credit facilities and proceeds of our bond issuances 
our liquidity requirements and working capital needs depend on a number of factors  including delivery rates and payment terms under our contracts  the level of research and development expenditures related to new programs  capital expenditures  growth and contractions in the business cycle  contributions to our union sponsored benefit plans and interest and debt payments 
as of december   we had a net cash outflow of million from operating activities 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund non acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject  in part  to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current levels of 
table of contents operations and absent any disruptive events  not limited to unplanned nonrecurring costs  management believes that internally generated funds  advance payments and payments from customers  government grants and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  research and development efforts and long term indebtedness obligations through at least if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
also  to the extent we may have lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses  we may need to raise additional capital 
in particular  increased working capital needs occur whenever we consummate acquisitions  invest in new product development or experience increased demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis 
our acquisition strategy may require substantial capital  and we may not be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  our total interest expense will increase 
we believe that the lenders participating in our credit facility will be willing and able to provide financing to us in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facility 
however  there can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  in the debt markets or our credit facility will not be impacted by the ongoing credit market disruptions 
we currently have manufacturing capacity to produce ship sets at the rates we have committed to our customers 
we have additional capacity on some of our products  but our capacity utilization on the fuselages for the b is at close to at our current production rate 
this capacity utilization rate is based on five days per week  three shifts per day operations 
our supply agreements typically have maximum production rates 
if a customer requests that we increase production rates above these stated maximum levels  additional negotiation would be required to determine whether we or our customer would bear the cost of any capital expenditures  tooling and non recurring engineering required as a result of such production rate increases 
our corporate credit ratings at standard poor s rating services and moody s investor service as of december  were unchanged at bb and ba  respectively 
our us pension plan remained fully funded at year end as a result of the plan s asset performance during  we now expect an increase in non cash pension income in future periods 
our plan investments are broadly diversified and we do not anticipate a near term requirement to make cash contributions to our us pension plan 
the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of their short maturities 
cash 
at december  and december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
we maintain bank accounts with highly rated financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in liquid  short term money market funds 
our cash investments have had no direct exposure to any sub prime asset classes 
financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to account for our derivative financial instruments  we follow the provisions of fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
the derivatives are valued at mark to market with the changes in fair market value of the instruments recorded at each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is effective as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item or when the hedge is no longer effective 
we present the cash flows associated with our derivatives as a component of the investing section of the statement of cash flows 
our use of derivatives has included interest rate swaps  as well as foreign currency swaps to manage our risk associated with us dollar denominated contracts negotiated by spirit europe 
we believe that the effect of significant increases or decreases in the aggregate fair value of our derivatives will not materially impact our liquidity

we recognize the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit s progress  case law developments  and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that with a million long term payable  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog as of december   our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft  regional jet  business jet and military equipment deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  was approximately billion 
this is a decrease of billion over our corresponding estimate as of the end of reflecting the fact that deliveries exceeded orders in backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing or airbus announced backlog on our supply agreements 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  our expected backlog as of december   may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period 
foreign operations we engage in business in various non us markets 
as of december   we have a foreign subsidiary with one facility in the united kingdom  which serves as a production facility  a worldwide supplier base  and a repair center for the european and middle eastern regions 
we purchase certain components and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers  including airbus  or resold to foreign end users ie  foreign airlines and militaries 
spirit has chosen malaysia as the location to establish its first asian manufacturing facility 
the facility became operational in the first quarter of in addition  spirit is building a new assembly facility in saint nazaire  france to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the airbus a xwb commercial aircraft from the facility in kinston  north carolina before they are shipped to airbus 
the new facility is expected to be operational in late july spirit is party to a joint venture operation with russian based progresstech ltd 
the company  known as spirit progresstech llc  which operates primarily from a branch office located in moscow  russia  provides aerospace engineering support services 
spirit has entered into a joint venture with hong kong aircraft engineering company limited haeco  and its subsidiary  taikoo aircraft engineering company limited taeco  cathay pacific airways limited  and cal asia to develop and implement a state of the art composite and metal bond component repair station in the asia pacific region 
the service center is called taikoo spirit aerosystems composite co

currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on 
table of contents foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments countries 
furthermore  the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total revenues for the same period 
inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit s contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars  spirit europe s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
in some cases our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
although the raw material industry is experiencing a softening in demand  some specific materials have yet to reflect a corresponding reduction in price 
we expect that raw material market pricing volatility will remain a factor that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities  we are exposed to various market risks that may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
these market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay on our variable rate debt 
other than the interest rate swaps described below  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  the funds in which our pension assets are invested  and trade accounts receivable 
accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers  amounts earned but unbilled  particular estimated contract changes  claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery  and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenues were from sales to boeing 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in liquid short term money market funds 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 

table of contents commodity price risks some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing  airbus and bae systems 
these collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from market volatility across the industry for certain specialized metallic and composite raw materials used in the aerospace industry 
although our supply agreements with boeing and airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing pricing increases for metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium despite softening market demand across the industry 
although the demand pressure has been somewhat eased for certain metallic and composite raw materials  the specialized nature of the materials used in the aerospace industry has prevented a corresponding decrease in prices 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we are reviewing a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
interest rate risks after the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as compared to million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest that varies with libor 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve months of approximately million 
as required under our senior secured credit facility  we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements periodically 
as of december   the interest swap agreements had notional amounts totaling million 
term b fair value  variable fixed fixed december  principal amount expires rate rate rate july libor july libor july libor total the fixed rate represents the rate at which interest is paid by the company pursuant to the terms of its interest rate swap agreements 
the effective term b fixed interest rate represents the fixed rate of the derivative instrument plus the basis point margin above the variable libor borrowing rate we pay on the term b loan 
the purpose of entering into these swaps was to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fair value of the swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet as an asset  if positive  or a liability  if negative 
the 
table of contents fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million at december  the company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of all estimated fair values 
the company has applied these valuation techniques at year end and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
the company attempts to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions which are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
foreign exchange risks during  the company entered into foreign currency transactions with notional amounts of for through to hedge revenue streams and known payments 
the notional amounts of the contracts remaining at december  was million 
as a result of the bae acquisition  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in british pounds sterling 
spirit europe s functional currency is the british pound sterling 
however  sales of spirit europe s products to boeing and some procurement costs are denominated in us dollars and euros 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause net sales and our expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate british pound sterling denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  the foreign exchange contracts for are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of approximately million with a notional amount of million at december  at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased our unrealized losses by million 
december  foreign risk from usd currency average average net liability change in year buy sell buy sell contract rate revaluation rate fair value revaluation rate in millions in millions includes foreign currency hedge contracts for through novated to spirit europe as a result of the bae acquisition buy sell  which had no underlying contractual transactions at the inception date of the contracts and  therefore  are classified as debt securities which are not subject to hedge accounting 
the mark to market values of these debt securities are recorded through the consolidated statement of operations on a monthly basis in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on investments debt and equity securities disclosures 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  the intercompany revolving credit facility with spirit europe is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the fluctuation in rates for resulted in a loss of million reflected in other income expense 
other than the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts  we have no other derivative financial instruments
