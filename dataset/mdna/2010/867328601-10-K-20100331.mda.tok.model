overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumor cancers 
our efforts are currently focused primarily on the development of voreloxin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
we have built a highly experienced cancer drug development organization committed to advancing our lead product candidate  voreloxin  in multiple indications to improve the lives of people with cancer 
we own worldwide development and commercialization rights to voreloxin and are currently preparing for anticipated phase development of the compound 
voreloxin is a first in class anti cancer quinolone derivative  or aqd a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer 
quinolone derivatives have been shown to mediate anti tumor activity by targeting mammalian topoisomerase ii  an enzyme critical for cell replication  and have demonstrated promising preclinical anti tumor activity 
we are currently completing three clinical trials of voreloxin i a phase clinical trial known as the reveal trial in previously untreated elderly patients with aml  for which enrollment was completed in october  with a total of patients dosed in one of three dosing schedules  ii a phase b clinical trial of voreloxin in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory aml  for which enrollment was completed in january  with a total of patients dosed  and iii a phase single agent clinical trial in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients  for which enrollment was completed in december  with a total of patients dosed across one of three dosing schedules 
in november  we announced that the us food and drug administration  or fda  had granted voreloxin orphan drug designation for the treatment of aml 
in february  we announced that we received formal guidance from the fda from end of phase meetings regarding further development of voreloxin for aml 
based on this guidance  we will look to conduct a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  pivotal trial evaluating the effect on overall survival of voreloxin in combination with cytarabine  a widely used chemotherapy in aml  compared to placebo 
table of contents with cytarabine  in patients with relapsed or refractory aml 
we anticipate initiating this multi national phase trial in the second half of management is currently in the process of evaluating alternatives for funding the voreloxin development program 
the most recent data from our two phase trials of voreloxin in aml were presented at the st annual meeting of the american society of hematology ash in december the most recent data from the phase trial of voreloxin in platinum resistant ovarian cancer were presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting in june we believe the data from these three ongoing clinical trials demonstrate that voreloxin shows promising safety and efficacy in aml and in platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
during the year  we have taken a number of important steps to focus our resources and efforts on the advancement of voreloxin we discontinued development of our product candidate  sns  a selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases  or cdks   and  which we had in licensed from bristol myers squibb company  or bms 
in march  the license agreement was terminated and sns was returned to bms 
in the first quarter of  we completed a phase trial of sns  a potent and selective pan aurora kinase inhibitor discovered internally at sunesis  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
as a maximum tolerated dose was not established in the trial and no responses were observed  further development of sns was suspended 
in march  we announced the sale of our interest in all of our lymphocyte function associated antigen  or lfa  patents and related know how to sarcode corporation  or sarcode  for total cash consideration of million  which was recorded as revenue in the second quarter 
in connection with the sale  the license agreement was terminated 
sarcode had been the exclusive licensee of those assets since march in february  we granted carmot therapeutics  inc an exclusive license to our proprietary fragment based lead discovery technology 
we retain full rights to the technology for use in our future internal discovery efforts 
in july  we received a milestone of million pursuant to a collaboration entered into with biogen idec in for biogen idec s selection of a raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer  which was earned and recorded as revenue in the second quarter 
biogen idec is currently conducting ind enabling preclinical work with the raf kinase development candidate 
on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors  including certain members of management  providing for a private placement of up to million  or the private placement 
we completed the initial closing of million of the private placement on april   and the second closing of million on october  in the initial closing  million of units were sold  resulting in net proceeds of million  and in the second closing  million of units were sold  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the units consist of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the private placement also contemplates the sale of up to the remaining million in common stock at per share to the same group of investors  subject to terms and conditions described in sources of liquidity below 
on january   we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
sales of our common stock through cantor  if any  would be made on the nasdaq capital market by means of 
table of contents ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by cantor and us 
cantor agreed to use its best efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we might impose 
we agreed to pay cantor a commission rate ranging between and of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through cantor as agent under the sales agreement 
we also agreed to reimburse cantor for certain expenses incurred in connection with entering into the sales agreement and provided cantor with customary indemnification rights 
under the terms of the sales agreement  we may also sell shares of our common stock to cantor  as principal for its own account  at a price negotiated at the time of sale 
if we sell shares to cantor in this manner  we will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the terms of any such transactions 
as of march   pursuant to the sales agreement with cantor  we had sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of the full million available under the facility 
net proceeds were million after deducting cantor s commission and costs to set up the facility 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future  as we continue the development of  and seek regulatory approvals for voreloxin 
we believe that currently available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including the net proceeds of million from sales of common stock through march  under the agreement with cantor  are sufficient to fund our operations through at least september  we will need to raise substantial additional funding in the near term in order to sustain operations beyond that date and before undertaking any additional clinical trials of voreloxin 
our significant negative cash flows and lack of financial resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
management is currently in the process of evaluating alternative funding sources 
if we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our working capital needs  we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our voreloxin development program and or limit or cease our operations 
on august   upon nasdaq s approval  the listing of our common stock was transferred from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
to maintain a listing on the nasdaq capital market  we are required to meet certain requirements  including a minimum closing bid price of per share  a market value of publicly held shares of at least million  and either a market value of listed securities of at least million or stockholders equity of at least million 
on september   we received a letter from the nasdaq listing qualifications staff  or the staff  notifying us that we do not comply with the minimum per share requirement for a continued listing  or the bid price requirement 
in accordance with nasdaq listing rules  we were given calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance 
to regain compliance  the bid price of our common stock needed to close at or above for at least consecutive business days at any time prior to march   which it did in the consecutive business days ending on december  on december   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum per share bid price requirement 
as of march   the bid price for our common stock had closed below the required per share minimum for consecutive business days 
as a result  we expect to receive a letter shortly from the staff  notifying us that we do not satisfy the minimum per share bid price requirement  and  in accordance with nasdaq s listing rules  that we will be afforded calendar days to regain compliance 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  subtopic  multiple element arrangements  or asc under asc  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and the applicable revenue recognition is applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable fees where we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  nonrefundable fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the projected performance period 
research funding from collaborations is recognized as revenue as the related research services are performed 
this funding is generally based on a specified amount per full time equivalent employee per year 
milestone payments which are substantive and at risk at the time of the execution of the collaboration agreement  are recognized upon completion of the applicable milestone event 
any future royalty revenue will be recognized based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  which include payments for work performed by contract research organizations  or cros  and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs are generally a significant component of research and development expenses 
non refundable costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are expensed immediately  with any refundable advances related to enrollment of the first patient recorded as prepayments and assessed for recoverability on a quarterly basis 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients progress through the clinical trial  including amortization of any first patient prepayments 
this amortization generally matches when the related services are rendered  however  these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred by the cros or clinical trial sites  and if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  our clinical trial accruals may not be accurate 
the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase common stock to our employees  directors and consultants under our stock option plans 
under our employee stock purchase plan  eligible employees can also purchase shares of common stock at of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of a month offering period or at the end of one of the two related month purchase periods 

table of contents we value these share based awards using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these input variables would affect stock based compensation expense 
private placement accounting the accounting for the initial and second closing of the sale of million and million of units  respectively  under our private placement  and subsequent revaluations of the related financial instruments  required fair values to be established at different dates  either individually or in aggregate  for the four primary components of the private placement a the series a convertible preferred stock  b the warrants to purchase common stock  c the option for the investors to participate in the second closing  or the second closing option  and d the option for the investors to participate in the common equity closing  or the common equity closing option 
the option pricing method  which utilizes the black scholes model  was selected to determine these fair values  which were calculated as a series of call options on the potential enterprise value of the company at different valuation points at which the claims of the different stakeholder groups on the enterprise value would change 
the results of the black scholes model are affected by the company s stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the financial instruments and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend rate over the expected term 
alternative models could have been selected to calculate these fair values  which may have produced significantly different results 
if we adopt a different valuation model in the future  this may result in a lack of consistency between periods and materially affect our fair value estimates 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
additionally  because the estimated fair values are affected by our stock price  fluctuations in our stock price  which has historically been volatile  may significantly affect our financial results 
recent accounting pronouncements the impact of recent accounting pronouncements that we have adopted is detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview of revenues we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future 
collaboration revenue over the past three years  we generated revenue primarily through payments received in connection with our collaborations with biogen idec  inc  johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development llc  or j jprd  and merck co  inc  or merck  consisting principally of revenue recognized from the amortization of upfront fees  and research funding and milestones paid by our collaborators  which substantially offset our related research and development expenses 
from january  to december   we recorded an aggregate of million in revenues from our collaboration partners 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  from biogen idec  which represented  and of our total revenue for these periods 
likewise  during this same three year period  we received million  million and  respectively  from merck  which represented  and of our total revenues for these periods 

table of contents as of march   our only remaining ongoing collaboration is with biogen idec 
our collaboration with merck will terminate effective as of june  and our collaboration with j jprd terminated on january  we are entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaboration with biogen idec upon the achievement of certain milestones by them 
additionally  we are entitled to receive royalty payments based on future sales of products  if any  resulting from this collaboration  although we do not expect to generate any royalty revenue from this collaboration in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect to have substantially lower collaboration revenue in and in future years from our existing collaboration with biogen idec unless any products that may result from it advance to a level where significant milestones will be payable to us 
license and other revenue in march  sarcode acquired our interest in all of its lfa patents and related know how for a total cash consideration of million  which was recorded as revenue in april in connection with the sale  the license agreement was terminated and we will not receive any future license fees  milestones or royalties under that license 
we still hold three secured convertible promissory notes issued under the original license agreement  with a total principal value of million  which are due in and are convertible into the preferred stock of sarcode at our option 
we have yet to record the amount represented by these notes as revenue  due to uncertainty of their collectibility 
overview of operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been related to research and development activities  and include costs incurred in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics and the advancement of product candidates towards clinical trials  in the execution of clinical trials  including those for voreloxin  in the development of novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities we are required to perform in connection with our strategic collaborations 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
the table below sets forth our research and development expense by program for each period presented year ended december  in thousands voreloxin sns sns discovery programs and new technologies other kinase inhibitors total 
table of contents as a result of the corporate realignment and reduction in force completed in june  or the restructuring  and the resulting wind down of our research activities  we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional research expenses related to the discovery of additional product candidates  the development or application of our proprietary fragment based drug discovery methods  or the development of in house research capabilities 
in addition  we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with our collaborations 
as of december   we had incurred million of expenses in the development of voreloxin since it was licensed from dainippon sumitomo pharma co  ltd 
in october  and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the development of voreloxin in and future years  including for the completion of the current phase clinical trials and in preparation for and conduct of anticipated pivotal trials 
as a result  we expect research and development expense to increase significantly in as compared to however  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process  we are unable to estimate the additional substantial costs we will incur in the voreloxin development program 
we are currently focused on clinical trials of voreloxin in targeted indications and patient populations 
based on results of translational research  clinical results  regulatory and competitive concerns and our overall financial resources  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and patient populations to treat and how much funding to direct to each indication on an ongoing basis 
this will affect our research and development expense going forward 
we are currently anticipating that development of voreloxin will be our highest priority 
if we engage a development or commercialization partner for our voreloxin program  or if  in the future  we acquire additional product candidates  our research and development expenses could be significantly affected 
we cannot predict whether future collaborative or licensing arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
under our biogen idec agreement  we have the right to participate in the co development and co promotion of product candidates for up to two targets including  at our option  the raf kinase target  on a worldwide basis excluding japan 
if we were to exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense would increase significantly 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in finance  legal  marketing  information technology  administration and general management  as well as non cash stock based compensation 
other significant costs include those related to facilities and fees paid to outside legal advisors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in  we expect general and administrative expense to be generally comparable to results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the completion of research funding and technology access fee amortization under the biogen idec collaboration in june  partially offset by an increase in milestone revenue in as a result of a million milestone earned from biogen idec s selection of a raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer 
license and other revenue increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the sale to sarcode in march of our interest in all patents and related know how that had previously been the subject of a license agreement with them 
the cash consideration of million was recorded as revenue in april  once all related materials had been transferred 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring  which resulted in decreases in headcount related expenses of million  allocated facility costs of million  clinical expenses of million and professional service costs of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and a restructuring plan implemented in april  or the restructuring  which together resulted in decreases in headcount related expenses of million and facility costs of million and also a reduction in professional service costs of million 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in the charges for included million for lease termination activities related to the restructuring and million for employee severance and related benefit costs related to the restructuring 
the net charge for lease termination activities included million for early lease termination fees paid to the landlord and million for third party commission  partially offset by the reversal of million in non cash deferred rent on the facility 
the charges were primarily comprised of million related to the restructuring 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in from million in  primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and lower average interest rates during interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in from million in  due to full payment of the outstanding balance under our equipment financing agreement with general electric capital corporation in november other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in as compared to other income  net of million in the expense in was primarily due to non cash charges of million related to the accounting for the private placement  which consisted of million recorded upon the initial closing in april and million upon the revaluation in june of the options to participate in the second closing and common equity closing 
years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in revenue from biogen idec resulting from the june termination of the research phase of our collaboration and a million decrease in research revenue from our bace program with merck 
partially offsetting these decreases was a milestone payment from j jprd for the selection of a compound targeting the cathepsin s enzyme 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due the restructuring  which resulted in a million decrease in expenses under our kinase inhibitors programs  a million decrease in clinical trial activity related to sns and sns  and a million decrease in expenses for discovery and new technology programs 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in voreloxin expenses due to increased clinical development activities 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due the restructuring  which resulted in decreases of million in employee related expenses  million in office related expenses and million 
table of contents in professional services 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in facilities and related expenses 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in the charges were primarily comprised of million related to the restructuring 
charges for the restructuring consisted of million for employee severance and related benefit costs  including non cash stock based compensation of million  and million related to asset impairment and facility exit costs 
the charges were primarily comprised of severance costs and charges relating to leased facilities 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and lower average interest rates during interest expense 
interest expense was comparable for both and  due to higher interest rates on lower outstanding debt obligation in  compared to lower interest rates on higher outstanding debt obligations in income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities may arise from differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their basis for financial reporting 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our policy is to recognize interest charges and penalties as other expense 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in  and the state net operating loss will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit carry forwards do not expire 
utilization of these net operating loss and tax credits carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
the limitations are applicable if an ownership change  as defined in the code  is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carry forwards before they can be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments from our collaboration partners  research grants  loans from biogen idec and other debt financings 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the decrease of million was primarily due to million of net cash used in operating activities  partially offset by net proceeds of million received from the first and second closings of the private placement  as described below 
no debt was outstanding at either balance sheet date 
on april   we completed the initial closing of million of the private placement  and on october   we completed the second closing of million 
in the initial closing  million of units 
table of contents were sold  resulting in net proceeds of million  and in the second closing  million of units were sold  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the units consist of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock  and were sold to accredited investors  including certain members of management 
under the private placement  an additional million of common stock may be sold at per share in a common equity closing upon the election of the holders of a majority of the series a convertible preferred stock issued in the private placement prior to the earlier of june   or a date determined with reference to our cash and investments balance dropping below million 
the common equity closing may also be completed upon our election prior to the earlier of june  and a qualifying alternative common stock financing  subject to the approval of the purchasers holding a majority of the series a convertible preferred stock issued in the private placement and subject to us selling at least million of common stock in the common equity closing 
on january   we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
we agreed to pay cantor fees of between and of the gross proceeds from each sale 
as of march   the full million available under the facility had been sold for net proceeds of million after commissions and expenses 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million used in and million used in net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges related to the private placement and million of stock based compensation  partially offset by a million credit for deferred rent related to the restructuring 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million including decreases of million in deferred revenue and million in accrued compensation  partially offset by adjustments for non cash items of million including million of restructuring charges  million of stock based compensation and million of depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by an adjustment for non cash items of million including million of stock based compensation  million of depreciation and amortization and million of restructuring charges 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in net cash provided in consisted of net proceeds from marketable securities transactions of million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided in consisted of net proceeds from marketable securities transactions of million and million from the sale of assets previously held for sale  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided in resulted primarily from net proceeds from marketable securities transactions of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to net cash used of million in and net cash provided of million in net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial and second closings of the private placement 
net cash used in consisted primarily of equipment loan repayments of million 
net cash provided in resulted primarily from net proceeds of million from a common stock offering and million from equipment loans 
operating cash requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other 
table of contents countries  and has been successfully commercialized 
we need to raise substantial additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of voreloxin 
additionally  we may evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  need for additional clinical trials  and other development activities  the economic and other terms and timing of any licensing or partnering arrangement into which we may enter  the costs associated with building or accessing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  if any  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we believe that currently available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including the net proceeds of million from sales of common stock through march  under the agreement with cantor  are sufficient to fund our operations through at least september  we will need to raise substantial additional funding in the near term in order to sustain operations beyond that date and before undertaking any additional clinical trials of voreloxin 
our significant negative cash flows and lack of financial resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
management is in the process of evaluating alternative funding sources  which may include raising proceeds from the third closing of the private placement  debt arrangements  a potential transaction related to rights associated with voreloxin  or otherwise 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of collaboration or product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through equity issuances including the possible third closing of the private placement and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described above  debt arrangements and or a possible partnership or license of development and or commercialization rights to voreloxin 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise significant additional capital in the near term would require us to delay or reduce the scope of our voreloxin development program and limit our ability to continue operations 
any one of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations our operating lease obligations as of december  relate to the leases for two facilities in south san francisco  california 
in december  we leased approximately  square feet of office space in a building at oyster point boulevard 
this lease expires in april  subject to our option to extend the lease through february in october  we leased approximately  square feet of laboratory space at allerton avenue 
this lease expires in october with our option to extend the lease through october 
table of contents the lease for the facility located at oyster point boulevard  which formerly served as our headquarters and research and development facility  was terminated in the first quarter of we also have agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the procedures to be performed in the particular clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled and the period of follow up required for patients in the trial 
off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
