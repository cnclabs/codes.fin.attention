item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis for the fiscal years ended march   and as set forth below in this item should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of black box  including the related notes 
the company s fiscal year ends on march references to fiscal year or fiscal mean the company s fiscal year ended march for the year referenced 
all dollar amounts are presented in thousands except for per share amounts or unless otherwise noted 
the company black box is a leading dedicated network infrastructure services provider 
black box offers one source network infrastructure services for communications systems 
the company s services offerings include design  installation  integration  monitoring and maintenance of voice  data and integrated communications systems 
the company s primary services offering is voice solutions  the company also offers premise cabling and other data related services and products 
the company provides technical support for all of its solutions which encompass all major voice and data product manufacturers as well as  hotline products that it sells through its catalog and internet web site and its on site services offices 
as of march   the company had more than  professional technical experts in offices serving more than  clients in countries throughout the world 
founded in  black box operates subsidiaries on five continents and is headquartered near pittsburgh in lawrence  pennsylvania 
with respect to voice services  the company s revenues are primarily generated from the sale and or installation of new voice communication systems  the maintenance of voice communication systems and moves  adds and changes mac work as customers employees change locations or as customers move or remodel their physical space 
the company s diverse portfolio of product offerings allows it to service the needs of its customers which it believes is a unique competitive advantage 
with respect to the sale of new voice communication systems  most significant orders are subject to competitive bidding processes and  generally  competition can be significant for such new orders 
the company is continually bidding on new projects to replace projects that are completed 
new voice communication system orders often generate a maintenance agreement to maintain the voice communication system which generally ranges from years for commercial clients and years for government clients 
sales of new voice communication systems and  to a lesser extent  mac work  is dependent upon general economic growth and the company s customers capital spending 
on the other hand  revenues from maintenance contracts generally are not dependent on the economy as customers seek to extend the life of their existing equipment and delay capital spending on new voice communication systems 
the company also has government contracts which generate significant revenues and are not as dependent on the overall economic environment as commercial customers 
maintenance and mac work revenues also are dependent upon the company s history and relationship with its customers and its long track record of providing high quality service 
similarly  the company s revenues for data services are generated from the installation or upgrade of data networks and mac work 
the installation of new data networks is largely dependent upon commercial employment and building occupancy rates 
installed data networks  however  may need to be upgraded in order to provide for larger  faster networks to accommodate the growing use of network technology 
additionally  data services projects can include mac work  similar to voice services projects  which is dependent on economic factors that are the same as those factors discussed above in relation to the voice services business 
there is and has been a trend toward convergence of voice and data networks 
since the company has technical expertise in both of these areas  the company believes that this is a competitive advantage 
both the voice services and data services businesses generate backlog 
at march   the company s backlog  defined as expected revenue related to executed client purchase orders or contracts that are estimated to be complete within days  was approximately  the company generates hotline services revenues from the sale of more than  products through its catalog  internet web site and the company s on site services offices 
the sale of these products is a highly fragmented and competitive business 
the company has been in this business for over years and has developed a reputation for providing high quality products  free technical support  comprehensive warranties and rapid order fulfillment 
with an average order size of less than  the company s hotline services is less impacted by capital spending and more so on general it spending 
the company s hotline services business provides additional distribution and support capabilities along with access to black box branded products to both the data services and voice services businesses which provides cost benefits 
the company services a variety of customers within most major industries  with the highest concentration in government  business services  technology  retail  healthcare and manufacturing 
factors that impact those verticals  therefore  could have an impact on the company 
while the company generates most of its revenues in north america  the company also generates revenues from around the world  primarily europe  so that factors that impact the european market could impact the company 
management strives to develop extensive and long term relationships with high quality customers as management believes that satisfied customers will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns

table of contents potential tax payments on september   the company received formal notice from the internal revenue service irs regarding its intent to begin an audit of the company s and tax years 
on august   the company received formal notice from the irs regarding its intent to begin an audit of the company s tax year 
in connection with these normal recurring audits  the irs requested certain documentation with respect to stock options for the company s  and tax years 
in connection with the review by the audit committee the audit committee of the board of the company s historical stock option granting practices  the company determined that a number of officers may have exercised options for which the application of section m may apply 
it was possible that these options could have been treated as having been granted at less than fair market value for federal income tax purposes because the company incorrectly applied the measurement date as defined in the applicable authoritative accounting literature 
if such options were deemed to have been granted at less than fair market value for purposes of section m  any non performance based compensation to officers  including proceeds from options exercised in any given tax year  in excess of  would have been disallowed as a deduction for tax purposes

table of contents legal proceedings please see the matters discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this form k  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance the company believes will be collected 
this allowance is based on both recent trends of certain accounts receivable specific reserve estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire accounts receivable pool general reserve 
the company computes a specific reserve by identifying specifically at risk accounts receivable and applying historic reserve factors to the outstanding balance 
the company computes a general reserve by reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying reserve factors based upon the age of the account receivable 
if the estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and has been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventory reserve based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand  market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the inventory reserve 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to events that impact the company s financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
deferred tax asset and liability balances are computed by identifying differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences which are multiplied by the current tax rate 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
if the company s estimate of the realizable deferred tax assets should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the deferred tax asset allowance 
goodwill the company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of its fiscal year  using data as of the end of the second quarter of its fiscal year 
goodwill is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill net book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  the company uses an income approach to derive a present value of the reporting unit s projected future annual cash flows and the present residual value of the reporting unit 
the company uses the income approach because it believes that the discounted future cash flows provide greater detail and opportunity to reflect facts  circumstances and economic conditions for each reporting unit 
in addition  the company believes that this valuation approach is a proven valuation technique and methodology for its industry and is widely accepted by investors 
the company uses a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows  which vary for each of the reporting units and include i future revenue growth rates  ii future operating profitability  iii the weighted average cost of capital and iv a terminal growth rate 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted future cash flows should change at some future date  the company could incur an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs 

table of contents in addition to estimating fair value of the company s reporting units using the income approach  the company also estimates fair value using a market based approach which relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
the company uses the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the market approach to validate the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the income approach 
the company conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of fiscal using data as of september  the following table reconciles the carrying value of goodwill  as of september   for the company s reportable segments as reported in its consolidated financial statements  to the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit which is used for the annual goodwill impairment assessment north all america europe other total goodwill as reported in financial statements adjustment goodwill for annual impairment assessment goodwill for annual impairment assessment represents the amount of goodwill that is at risk by reporting unit 
the results of the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment conducted during the third quarter of fiscal indicate that goodwill is not impaired in any of the company s reporting units 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the net book value of the reporting unit and the surplus of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the net book value of the reporting unit as of september  north all america europe other total estimated fair value of the reporting unit net book value of the reporting unit surplus to illustrate the sensitivity of the discounted future cash flows  an instantaneous basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital  which  holding all other assumptions constant  would be material to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would produce a decrease in the fair value of the reporting units by   and  for north america  europe and all other  respectively 
since september   the company s stock market capitalization has been lower than its net book value 
each of the company s reporting units continues to operate profitably and generate significant cash flow from operations  and the company expects that each will continue to do so in fiscal and beyond 
the company also believes that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for the business that would adequately cover the difference between the recent stock trading prices and the book value 
future events that could result in an interim assessment of goodwill impairment and or an impairment loss include  but are not limited to  i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a further decline in market capitalization below book value and v a modification to the company s reporting segments 
management is currently considering alternative reporting segments for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance 
this contemplated change in reporting segments would affect the reporting units currently being used in the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment 
any such change could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs 
long lived assets other than goodwill the company reviews long lived assets  including property  plant  equipment and indefinite definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
loss contingencies the company incurs contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  such as future warranty obligations and potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters 
the company accrues for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents restructuring costs the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual 
revenue recognition within the company s hotline services service segment  revenues are recognized when title to products sold passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment from the company s location

service contracts are generally pre billed  recorded in deferred revenue within the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis 
revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized immediately in the financial statements 
the company has historically made reasonably accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates

to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so that the net interest margin is not  on a material basis  adversely affected by the movements in interest rates
