item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview declined in as compared with our client and dollar retention rate increased in as compared with however our enrichment rate continued to decline in as compared to future declines in client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
ability to develop and offer new products and services 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services 
these new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service  or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service  is risky and costly 
we may not be able to introduce new  or assimilate acquired  products or services successfully 
our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business 
loss of key management 
our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees 
the loss of any one of them  in particular george f 
colony  our founder  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  could adversely affect our business 
the ability to attract and retain qualified professional staff 
our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team  research analysts  and experienced sales and marketing personnel 
thus  our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates 
we experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of internet and emerging technology products  other research firms  management consulting firms  print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies  many of which have substantially greater ability  either through cash or equity  to attract and compensate professionals 
if we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent  we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business 
failure to anticipate and respond to market trends 
our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients 
the technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes 
the environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis  strategies and advice on issues of importance to them 
meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources 
any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments  technologies  and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations 
competition 
we compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services 
we may also face increased competition from internet based research firms 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  information gathering  and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients  as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies  survey based general market research firms and general business consulting firms 
our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market  and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services 
increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share 
fluctuations in our operating results 
our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and which may affect our stock price 
these factors include  but are not limited to trends in technology spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions 
the timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients 
the utilization of our advisory services by our clients 
the timing of revenue generating events sponsored by us 
the introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors 
the hiring and training of new analysts and sales personnel 
changes in demand for our research and advisory services 
as a result  our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock 
factors such as announcements of new products  services  offices  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us  our competitors  or in the technologies services industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general 
we may realize losses on our investments or be unable to liquidate these investments at desired times and in desired amounts 
at december   we had approximately million of long term marketable investments in municipal notes with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
in february  auctions had begun to fail for these securities  which means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have not received written comments from the securities and exchange commission that remain unresolved 
item properties our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in cambridge  massachusetts  substantially all of which is currently occupied by the company 
this facility accommodates research  marketing  sales  technology  and operations personnel 
the lease term of this facility expires in september we have the option to extend this lease for an additional five year term 
on september   we entered into a build to suit net lease lease with bhx  llc  as trustee of acorn park i realty trust and predecessor to discovery park  llc landlord pursuant to which the landlord will build a new corporate headquarters building for our company in an office park in the alewife section of cambridge  massachusetts 
pursuant to the lease  as amended  the landlord will construct an approximately  square foot building building and lease the building and parcel to us to be used as our new corporate headquarters 
during construction  we will continue to occupy our current corporate headquarters in cambridge  massachusetts under the existing lease for such premises 
the commencement date under the lease is presently expected to be on or about september  we also rent office space in foster city and san francisco  california  new york city  dallas  mclean virginia  austin  texas  amsterdam  frankfurt  london and paris 
we also lease office space on a relatively short term basis in various other locations in the north america  europe and asia

the other income amount includes a net foreign exchange loss of approximately million million after tax resulting primarily from the remeasurement of certain intercompany payables and receivables 
of the net million loss  approximately million related to periods prior to effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update requiring the recognition of stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income based upon the fair value of the award recognized over the related service period 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million  million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the operating income amount includes a million reorganization charge for facility consolidations and a reduction in force of approximately employees 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and from our advisory services and events 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services independently and or to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits and stock based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
deferred revenue reflects billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve month period who renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows years ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end years ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end the increase in deferred revenue from to is primarily due to increased demand for our products due to the improvement in the economy in the fourth quarter of compared to and well as the effect of the jupiterresearch and strategic oxygen acquisitions completed in july and december  respectively 
see note acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in agreement value from to is reflective of the economic downturn in the second half of through the majority of which resulted in a lower number of clients and lower enrichment rates in compared to and also is due to the exclusion in of agreement value in excess of the first year value for multiple year contracts signed in client and dollar retention amounts were essentially flat in compared to the increase in deferred revenue from to is primarily due to the acquisition of jupiterresearch 
the increase in agreement value from to is primarily due to an increase in the average contract size and to the acquisition of jupiterresearch 
the acquisition of jupiterresearch accounted for million of agreement value at december  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment all declined slightly year over year primarily due to the effects of a global economic downturn in the second half of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing our research  performing advisory services and consulting projects  hosting events and conducting teleconferences 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
forrester teleconferences revenue and reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual memberships  which include access to our research  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester teleconferences  and the right to attend one event  are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
we offer our clients a service guarantee  which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses  which are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates 
we are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock based awards for recognition of compensation expense 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
in addition  for our performance vested options and restricted stock units  we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned and or the vesting period of the award 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related investment funds 
these investment funds are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other than temporary impairment in their value occurs or the investment is liquidated 
for investments that are accounted for using the equity method  we record our share of the investee s operating results each period 
we review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment in the investment has occurred 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  technology  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from acquisitions 
such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and before the carryforwards expire 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred income tax asset for which realization is less than likely 
we record accruals for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured and recorded  using a probability weighted approach  as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position  evaluated in light of all available evidence 
valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in us treasury and us government agency securities  taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes some of which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
the assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments 
we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  as required under current accounting standards 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
as of december   we held municipal bonds with a fair value of million million at par value with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars with two investment advisors 
the fair value of the ars was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates  based on data available at december   of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for these securities 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  ubs ars 
although the company expects to sell its ubs ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy the company s ubs ars 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the right 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ubs ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ubs ars 
the right is recognized as a freestanding instrument that is accounted for at fair value separately from the underlying ubs ars investment 
we valued the right using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates and timing and amount of cash flow  based on data available at december  and adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change and any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of this right 
the value of the right of million  which largely offsets the unrealized loss on the ubs ars securities subject to the right  is included in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  within marketable securities and changes in its value are included in the consolidated statements of income  together with the change in the unrealized loss on the ubs ars subject to the right for the year ended december  and  as other income  net 
we believe that any subsequent changes in the value of the right will largely offset any fair value changes of the ubs ars  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
our remaining ars are held by another investment advisor  who has not made an offer similar to ubs 
we continue to classify the non ubs ars as long term available for sale securities 
accordingly  any change in associated market value has been recorded in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets during the years ended december  and if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive loss or impairment charges within the consolidated statements of income 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted

we generated cash from operating activities of million during and million during the slight decrease in cash provided from operations is primarily attributable to a million decrease in net income in that was almost completely offset by changes in working capital and an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization charges in during  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting primarily of million used for net purchases of marketable investments and a million increase in restricted cash 
the restricted cash was comprised of million placed in escrow under a lease signed in for leasehold improvements for our new headquarters to be constructed in cambridge  massachusetts  as well as million of the purchase price placed in escrow in connection our acquisition of strategic oxygen in december investing activities in also included million for acquisitions of businesses and million for purchases of property and equipment 
during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  consisting primarily of million generated from net sales of marketable investments  partially offset by million for the acquisition of jupiterresearch and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
our financing activities principally consist of repurchases of our common stock and the issuance of stock under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans

during  we used million to repurchase stock and received approximately million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
our board of directors has authorized an aggregate million to purchase our common stock under a stock repurchase program 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during as of december   we held approximately million million at par value of state and municipal bonds with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government or municipalities 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities 
throughout auction failures continued and  as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par ars originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  july  ubs ars 
we currently intend to sell our ubs ars  valued at million at december   to ubs under the right during the second half of based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on our ars investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable investments of million 
we do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable investments  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
as of december   we had future contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases under a build to suit lease entered into on september   whereby the landlord will build a new corporate headquarters for us in cambridge  massachusetts  we have committed to construct approximately million of leasehold improvements in the building under the terms of the lease 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and final amount of the payments  the above table does not include the million of future leaseholds 
we expect to incur the majority of these costs in the funding for the leasehold improvements has been placed in an escrow account and is included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets at december  the million in escrow will be increased or decreased based upon the final estimate of construction costs and will be released from escrow as the leasehold improvements are constructed 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
the securities  other than money market funds  and the ars for which we have accepted the right from ubs  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
at december   we held approximately million million at par value of ars 
in february  auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout the right from ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitles us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  ubs ars 
at december   ars subject to the right had a fair value and par value of million and million  respectively 
in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ubs ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of the ubs ars 
although we expect to sell our ubs ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july  it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
in lieu of our acceptance of the right  the ubs ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ubs ars if the auction process fails 
the value of the right may largely offset the decline in fair value of the ubs ars 
we valued the right as a put option asset using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ubs ars beginning june  the combined fair value of the right and the ubs ars is equal to the par value of the ubs ars 
the assumptions used in valuing both the ubs ars and the put option are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which could result in significant changes to their fair value 
the remaining million at par value of ars may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets as long term marketable investments as of december  based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we valued the ars using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars  based on data available at december  the assumptions used in valuing these ars are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these ars the following table provides information about our investment portfolio excluding the value of the right of million 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity or auction reset dates in us dollars dollars in thousands years ended december  state and municipal agency obligations federal agency and corporate obligations total investments weighted average interest rates foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to date  the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has not had a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro or other foreign currencies 
as of december   the total assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets  related to non us dollar denominated currencies were approximately million
