item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
telaprevir  our lead drug candidate  is being evaluated in a fully enrolled registration program focused on treatment na ve and treatment failure patients with genotype hcv infection 
we currently intend to submit an nda for telaprevir in the united states in the second half of  assuming the successful completion of the registration program 
if we are able to obtain marketing approval for telaprevir in accordance with our current development and regulatory timelines  we expect to initiate sales of telaprevir in the united states in we are pursuing a number of other clinical development programs  including a registration program for vx  the lead drug candidate in our cystic fibrosis program 
we plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and to develop selected drug candidates that emerge from those programs  alone or with third party collaborators 
business focus over the last several years  we have invested significant financial and management resources in the late stage development of telaprevir and in strengthening our pipeline of drug candidates  through research and development activities and the acquisition of virochem pharma inc to fund these investments  we have raised an aggregate of approximately billion over the three years ended december   through sales of common stock and convertible debt  other financial transactions and one time license fees 
in order to execute our business plan and achieve profitability  we will need to complete the development of telaprevir on a timely basis and effectively commercialize telaprevir in the united states  where we have retained marketing rights to telaprevir 
over the next several years we believe that in addition to telaprevir we will need to further investigate other potential therapies for the treatment of hcv and to research  develop and commercialize additional drug candidates in other therapeutic areas with significant unmet need 
as a result  we are committed to advancing the other clinical drug candidates in our pipeline and investing in our preclinical research programs 
in hcv  we are planning on evaluating telaprevir in combination with vx  an investigational polymerase inhibitor that we obtained in through our acquisition of virochem  in a phase a clinical trial that will involve a number of combination regimens 
the objective of our ongoing clinical trials of hcv drug candidates and our earlier stage activities with respect to potential treatments for hcv is to significantly improve the treatment options for genotype hcv infection 
the most advanced of our other drug candidates is vx  which we are evaluating in a registration program that focuses on patients with cf who have the gd mutation in the gene responsible for cf 
we also are planning on evaluating vx in combination with vx in a phase a clinical trial in patients with the most common mutation in the gene responsible for cf 
we have initiated a phase a clinical trial of vx in patients with moderate to severe ra and a phase a clinical trial of vx in patients with treatment resistant epilepsy 
drug discovery and clinical development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  side effects  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product 
most chemical compounds that are investigated 
table of contents as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation method  or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being targeted or that adversely affect the competitive commercial profile of the drug candidate 
throughout the development process for a drug candidate we must work collaboratively with regulatory authorities  including the fda  in order to identify the specific scientific issues that need to be addressed in the clinical trials to support continued development and approval of the drug candidate 
if the data from our ongoing clinical trials or nonclinical studies regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate are not favorable or regulatory authorities request additional clinical trials or changes to existing clinical trial protocols  we may be forced to delay or terminate the clinical development program for that candidate  which  particularly in the case of telaprevir  could materially harm our business 
because our investments are subject to considerable risks  we closely monitor the results of our clinical trials  discovery research and our nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our portfolio investments in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights  with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
although we believe that our development activities and the clinical trial data we have obtained regarding telaprevir have reduced the risks associated with obtaining regulatory approval  we cannot be sure that our development of telaprevir will lead to such regulatory approval of telaprevir or that such approval  if obtained  will occur in with respect to our other drug candidates  including vx  we have more limited data from clinical trials and nonclinical studies and as a result it is difficult to predict which  if any  of these drug candidates ultimately will result in pharmaceutical products 
commercialization we plan to market telaprevir in north america  and we hold worldwide commercial rights to the other drug candidates in our pipeline 
over the past several years  we have expanded our commercial organization with a focus on building our understanding of the hcv market  developing our commercial strategy for the potential launch of telaprevir  and planning the infrastructure necessary to support future commercial activities 
in the period prior to the anticipated launch of telaprevir  we will expand our commercial organization to an even more significant extent 
this expansion will include implementation of internal systems and infrastructure in order to support commercial sales  incorporation of appropriate compliance policies and procedures  establishment of patient focused programs and hiring a sales force to promote telaprevir  if approved  to health care providers 
we are assembling a group of executives with broad experience in marketing  sales  distribution  and cost reimbursement of drugs 
we will continue to build our commercial infrastructure by hiring a sales management team followed by a commercial sales force in the united states 
if we obtain approval  we may market and sell one or more of our other drug candidates in markets outside north america  which would require additional expansion of our commercial organization 
manufacturing we will require a supply of telaprevir for sale in north america and a supply of vx for sale worldwide if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval for either or both of these drug candidates 
we rely on an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our drug 
table of contents candidates for clinical trials  and we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties for the foreseeable future to meet our commercial supply needs for any of our drug candidates that are approved for sale 
third party contract manufacturers  including some in asia  supply us with raw materials  and contract manufacturers in the european union and the united states convert these raw materials into drug substance  and convert the drug substance into final dosage form 
establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third party relationships 
although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain  we do not have complete control over their activities 
corporate collaborations corporate collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
historically  we have not had the resources to develop and commercialize all of the drug candidates that we have identified or for which we have rights 
therefore we have relied on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some or all of our drug candidates 
we have been successful in initiating productive collaborations with janssen and mitbsubishi tanabe relating to telaprevir  and our collaboration with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated contributed to the discovery of vx and vx our early collaboration with glaxosmithkline plc resulted in two marketed drugs for the treatment of hiv 
collaborations continue to be an important part of our strategy going forward  although the structure and scope of available collaborative opportunities has changed in the past and may change in the future based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions 
financing strategy we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to continue to incur losses at least until we obtain approval for and successfully commercialize a product  if we ever do 
therefore  we have been dependent in large part on our ability to raise significant funding to finance our research and development operations  to create a commercial infrastructure  and to meet our overhead costs and long term contractual commitments and obligations 
to date  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  investment income and the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
as an element of our financial strategy we have from time to time transferred to third parties future financial rights under specific collaborations in exchange for one time cash payments 
for example  in we entered into two financial transactions that related to potential future milestone payments under our collaboration with janssen that resulted in aggregate payments to us of million 
also in  we received a one time cash payment of million from mitsubishi tanabe and the right to a potential future milestone payment of up to million  as part of an amendment to an existing agreement with mitsubishi tanabe 
this amendment provided mitsubishi tanabe with a fully paid license to commercialize telaprevir in japan and specified other countries in the far east and the right and obligation to manufacture telaprevir for sale in their territory 
in  for a one time cash payment to us of million  we sold our right to receive royalty payments  net of subroyalty amounts payable to a third party  arising from sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase under our agreement with glaxosmithkline 
we expect that we will incur substantial expenses in order to complete the development and commercialization of telaprevir while at the same time continuing the development of our other drug candidates and building our other capabilities 
as a result  we may raise additional capital in order to maintain adequate working capital and cash reserves to continue both our development and commercialization of telaprevir and our diversified research  discovery and development efforts 
we expect we would need to raise additional capital if the development of telaprevir was materially delayed 
we may raise additional capital from public offerings or private placements of our securities or 
table of contents other methods of financing 
we cannot be sure that financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs  including clinical trials  incur significant cash exit costs  or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our drug candidates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we monitor and analyze changes in facts and circumstances that might have a material effect on our estimates and assumptions in the future 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results business combinations  derivative instruments and embedded derivatives  revenue recognition  research and development expenses  restructuring expense  and stock based compensation expense 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  including note b accounting policies  included in this annual report on form k 
business combinations in march  we acquired virochem for million in cash and common stock with a fair market value of million 
we assigned the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill related to the potential synergies from the possible development of combination therapies involving telaprevir and the acquired drug candidates 
the allocations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date included million of intangible assets related to in process research and development and a million deferred tax liability 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included million of intangible assets related to in process research and development and a million deferred tax liability 
the intangible assets acquired were in process research and development assets relating to the drug candidates being developed by virochem  primarily vx and vx  each of which was in phase clinical development at the date of acquisition 
vx and vx had estimated fair values on the acquisition date of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we considered virochem s other clinical drug candidates and determined that vch  virochem s lead hiv drug candidate  had an estimated fair value on the acquisition date of million  based on development costs through the acquisition date  and that the other clinical drug candidates had no fair value because the clinical and nonclinical data for those drug candidates did not support further development as of the acquisition date 
we also considered virochem s preclinical programs and other technologies and determined that because of uncertainties related to the safety  efficacy and commercial viability of the potential drug candidates  market participants would not ascribe value to those assets 

table of contents we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as in process research and development  using a variety of methods  including present value models that are based upon multiple probability weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates 
the present value models used to estimate the fair values of vx and vx required us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates market participants would make in evaluating a drug development asset  including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of the associated drug candidate  the timing of and the expected costs to complete in process research and development projects  future cash flows from potential product sales  and appropriate discount rates 
the estimated fair value ascribed to vx and vx was based on the estimated fair value that would be ascribed to each of these compounds by a market participant that acquired both compounds in a single transaction 
the assumed probability of advancing vx and vx through various phases of development reflects the understanding among market participants that most drug candidates that enter phase clinical trials are not ultimately approved for commercial sale 
while  on the date of acquisition  vx and vx were each at a similar stage of development  we attributed a significantly higher value to vx than to vx because the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx research program was significantly more promising than the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx research program 
in addition  the fair value estimate incorporates our determination that a market participant would not be likely to continue development of vx unless future data from clinical trials or nonclinical studies of vx resulted in a delay or discontinuation of the vx development program 
projections of the duration and cost of nonclinical studies and clinical trials vary significantly over the life of a project depending on developments in the program over time  but in order to estimate the fair market value on the acquisition date we made the following assumptions from the perspective of market participants regarding the potential timing and costs to develop vx and or vx we assumed if a drug candidate were successfully developed in the united states it would take approximately five to nine years from the date of the acquisition in order to obtain marketing approval 
in addition  for the valuation  we assumed an estimate of cost from acquisition to launch to develop a drug candidate that was within a range of million to million 
future cash flows  if any  would not be generated until a drug candidate completed all required phases of clinical trials and obtained regulatory approval 
the risk adjusted discount rate for each of these projects was approximately 
the in process research and development assets were recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we maintain each of these assets on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired 
if we complete a project  we will amortize the carrying value of the related intangible asset over the remaining estimated life of the asset 
if we determine that a project has become impaired or we abandon a project  we will write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and will take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs 
in order to complete an acquired research and development project  the related drug candidate must be evaluated in later stage clinical trials  which are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of pharmaceutical products 
if the fair value of any of these drug candidates  and in particular vx  becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing the drug candidate  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
vx  which is considered a backup compound to vx  could be impaired by data pertaining to the potential successful development of vx  which could result in significant charges in the period in which that data is analyzed and the determination is made 
these intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
post acquisition research and development expenses related to the in process research and development projects will be expensed as incurred 
in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents  we evaluated vx  vx  vch and goodwill for impairment 
no impairment was found with respect to vx  vx or goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of million related to vch  which reduced the intangible assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheet by million and also resulted in an adjustment to our deferred tax liability 
derivative instruments and embedded derivatives september financial transactions in connection with the two financial transactions that we entered into in september  we issued the notes  which have a face value of million and do not carry an explicit interest rate  for million in cash 
the notes are secured by million of potential future telaprevir milestone payments that we expect to receive from janssen 
we also sold million in additional potential future telaprevir milestone payments that we expect will be payable by janssen for a cash payment of million 
the notes contain an embedded derivative related to their potential early repayment or redemption 
the separate sale of the potential million in future milestone payments is accounted for as a free standing derivative instrument 
in order to account for the notes and the sale of the rights to the potential future milestone payments  we were required to estimate the fair value of the derivative embedded in the notes and of the derivative associated with the million in potential future milestone payments 
the models we used to estimate these fair values require  among other things  estimates of the assumptions market participants would make regarding the timing and probability of achieving the milestones and the appropriate discount rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded interest expense of million related to the notes and an additional net expense of million related to the changes in estimated fair value of the derivative related to the million in potential future milestone payments and the derivative embedded in the notes 
notes the notes had a residual value at issuance of million  excluding the fair value of the embedded derivative 
that embedded derivative had a fair value at issuance of million 
we record a quarterly interest expense with respect to the notes that is determined using the effective interest rate method  which increases the amount of the liability for our notes each quarter by an amount corresponding to this interest expense through the stated maturity date  unless redeemed or repaid earlier 
in addition  we evaluate the embedded derivative for changes in fair value on at least a quarterly basis 
as of december   the value of the notes was million and the fair value of the embedded derivative was million 
we expect that the net expense related to the notes that we will recognize based on interest expense and gains and losses on the embedded derivative over the period between december  and october  will equal million  which is the difference between the million face value of the notes and the fair value of the notes with their embedded derivative on december  however  the timing of these expenses or any gains will depend on a number of factors  including factors related to the probability and timing of achieving the relevant milestone events and to applicable discount rates  and could result in material expenses or gains in any quarterly period 
sale of future milestone payments the fair value on the sale date of the free standing derivative instrument created by the sale of million of future milestone rights was million 
as of december   the fair value of the free standing derivative was million 
we will evaluate this free standing derivative for changes in fair value on at least a quarterly basis 
any change in the fair value will be recorded as a loss or gain in the period in which it becomes known 
if these milestone events are achieved  we expect that we will recognize net expenses over the period between december  and the date the milestones are achieved equal to million  which is the difference between the million the purchaser will 
table of contents receive if all the milestone events are achieved and the fair value of the free standing derivative on december  because our estimate of the fair value of the free standing derivative includes the application of a discount rate  we expect to record costs to reflect the time value of money each quarter 
however  the timing of any other expenses or any gains will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things  factors related to the probability and timing of achieving the relevant milestone events and to applicable discount rates  and could result in material losses or gains in any quarterly period 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
in addition  we sold our rights to receive future royalties from our hiv assets and have been recognizing revenues in connection with that transaction since the date of the sale in may up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration agreements  including the million we received from janssen in and the million we received from mitsubishi tanabe in the third quarter of  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach often has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our estimates in light of changes in the development plans for our drug candidates 
because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance have changed in the past and may change in the future 
our estimates regarding the period of performance under the janssen collaboration agreement were adjusted in  and again in the third quarter of  as a result of changes in the global development plan for telaprevir  which contemplates the conduct of certain development activities in the post approval period if telaprevir is approved for marketing 
these adjustments were made on a prospective basis beginning in the periods in which the changes were identified 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in the amount of revenues we recognized from the janssen collaboration by million per quarter for the first adjustment and by million per quarter for the second adjustment 
any future adjustment in our estimates of the period of performance under any of our collaborations could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee related to that collaboration are recognized 
for example  if we adjust our estimates as of january  to increase the period of performance under the janssen agreement by one year  it would result in a decrease in the amount of deferred revenues we recognize from our janssen collaboration of million per quarter beginning in the first quarter of milestone payments at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone event are substantive  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone event  as well as the level of successful effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a milestone event to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment cannot be recognized when the milestone 
table of contents event is achieved  but must be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
where a substantive milestone event is achieved in a collaboration arrangement and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  the payment is recognized as earned subject to specific policies applicable where we have obligations remaining after achievement of the milestone 
because achievement of a substantive milestone event under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone event often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
all of the milestones that have been achieved under our janssen collaboration agreement during the three years ended december  have been considered substantive 
in the past  significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenues from milestone payments have contributed to significant fluctuations in our overall collaborative revenues 
royalty revenues in may  we entered into a purchase agreement with fosamprenavir royalty  lp pursuant to which we sold  and fosamprenavir royalty purchased for a one time cash payment to us of million  our right to receive royalty payments  net of subroyalty amounts payable to a third party  arising from sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase under our agreement with glaxosmithkline 
we deferred the recognition of million of revenues in connection with this sale 
on may   we began recognizing these deferred revenues under the units of revenue method 
under this method  the amount of deferred revenues to be recognized as royalty revenues in each period is calculated by multiplying the following the net royalty payments due from glaxosmithkline to fosamprenavir royalty for the period by the ratio of the revenues we received from the sale of our rights to hiv royalty payments that we have not yet recognized to the total estimated remaining net royalties that we expect glaxosmithkline to pay fosamprenavir royalty over the remaining term of the agreement 
estimating the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty requires the use of subjective estimates and assumptions  including estimates regarding the size of the potential market for hiv protease inhibitors  the competitive position of lexiva telzir specifically and hiv protease inhibitors generally with respect to currently approved drugs and drugs that may be approved in the future  and the pricing of lexiva telzir 
changes to our estimate of the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty could have a material effect on the amount of royalty revenues we recognize in a particular period 
prior to may  royalty revenues typically were recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories and generally were recognized in the period the sales occurred 
we reconciled and adjusted for differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues in the quarter any differences became known 
these differences were not significant 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded through research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in our drug candidates  which are considered research and development expenses due to the drug candidates stages of development  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 

table of contents when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services and costs for commercial supply of our drug candidates  incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
we are incurring significant costs related to commercial supplies of telaprevir  which entered into phase development in the first quarter of we also are beginning to incur costs related to commercial supplies of vx  although these have been considerably less than the costs related to commercial supplies of telaprevir 
after a drug candidate enters into phase clinical development  determining whether to continue to classify all of these costs as research and development expenses or to capitalize some of them as inventory involves significant judgments 
generally  inventory may be capitalized if it is probable that future revenues exceeding the costs of the inventory will be generated from the sale of the inventory 
while we believe that the development activities and clinical trial data to date have reduced the risks associated with obtaining marketing approval for telaprevir  for accounting purposes we continue to expense all of our costs related to commercial supplies of telaprevir because of the inherent risks of drug development 
to the extent that we continue to consider these costs as research and development expenses as we continue development of telaprevir  we expect that if and when we receive marketing approval for telaprevir the costs of our initial commercial supplies of telaprevir will have already been expensed 
a consequence of the application of this accounting policy is that during the initial period after the potential launch of telaprevir our cost of goods sold will not reflect costs recorded as research and development expenses in prior periods 
restructuring expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred 
the liability for accrued restructuring expense of million at december  is related to that portion of our facility in kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy 
this liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of the net amount of our ongoing obligation 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of the subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
for example  we currently have two subleases for portions of the kendall square facility with remaining terms of one and three years  respectively  and we have made estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases 
market variability may require adjustments to those assumptions in the future 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated or expires  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our judgments  to reflect any changed circumstances 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we measure the compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and we recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the associated employee service period  which generally is the vesting period of the equity award  or the derived service period for awards with market conditions 
for our awards with performance conditions  we make estimates regarding the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance condition which affect the period over which the expense is recognized 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  or if the likelihood of achievement of a performance condition changes  our results could be materially affected

in  we increased our workforce  particularly in our development and commercialization organizations  leading to increased employee related expenses

we recognized a total of million from the achievement of milestones in for which there were no corresponding milestones achieved in the million in milestone revenue from the janssen collaboration in was an increase of million in comparison to in the third quarter of  we entered into two financial transactions related to million in potential future milestone payments related to the regulatory filing with and approval of telaprevir by the european medicines evaluation agency  and the launch of telaprevir in the european union 
if janssen is able to successfully commercialize telaprevir in accordance with current development timelines  we anticipate these milestones will be earned prior to april we expect that  when and if earned  these milestones will result in collaborative revenues of which the proceeds from the first million would be used to redeem the notes and the remaining million would be paid by janssen to the purchaser of these milestones 
in  our collaborative revenues from sources other than janssen primarily related to our collaboration with mitsubishi tanabe 
on july   we entered into an amendment to our license  development and commercialization agreement with mitsubishi tanabe that provided for a million payment in connection with the execution of the amendment 
this payment was initially classified as deferred revenues and is being recognized over our expected period of performance 
in  we recognized a total of million of revenues from mitsubishi tanabe  including the amortized portion of the million up front payment 
in  our collaborative revenue from sources other than janssen primarily related to million of revenue from mitsubishi tanabe relating to reimbursements for development costs  milestone payments and the sale of materials to mitsubishi tanabe  and the million milestone we achieved pursuant to our collaboration with merck  for which there was no corresponding milestone payment in the decrease in our total collaborative revenues from sources other than janssen in as compared to was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from our collaboration with cfft 
in early  we completed our reimbursable activities under our collaboration with cfft  which resulted in the million decrease in revenues from this collaboration in as compared to royalty revenues our royalty revenues relate to sales of the hiv protease inhibitors lexiva telzir and agenerase by glaxosmithkline 
on may   we sold our right to receive future royalties from glaxosmithkline with respect to these products  excluding the portion allocated to pay a subroyalty on these net sales to a third party  in return for a one time cash payment of million 
on may   we deferred the recognition of million of revenues from this sale 
we are recognizing these deferred revenues over the term of our agreement with glaxosmithkline under the units of revenue method 
we will continue to recognize royalty revenues equal to the amount of the third party subroyalty and an offsetting royalty expense for the third party subroyalty payment 
the million  or  decrease in royalty revenues in compared to  and the million  or  decrease in royalty revenues in compared to  resulted primarily from this sale of our future hiv royalties in the second quarter of in  we expect that we will recognize as royalty revenues a portion of the remaining deferred revenues from the sale of the royalty stream plus the full amount of the third party subroyalty

our research and development expenses fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of activities related to the development of clinical drug candidates 
our sales  general and administrative expenses generally have been increasing as we expand our commercial capabilities in preparation for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
research and development expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses development expenses total research and development expenses the million increase in our total research and development expenses in compared to was primarily the result of increases in expenses related to our workforce as we continued to advance telaprevir and our other drug candidates through clinical development  partially offset by decreases in contractual services expenses 
our research and development expense levels were similar in and as fluctuations in development expenses  including increases in expenses related to our workforce and a decrease in expenses related to commercial supply investment for telaprevir  resulted in a small decrease in research and development expenses 
in  we expect that our total research and development expenses will increase as we increase our investment in commercial supplies of telaprevir in order to prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir in our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for our drug candidates  including telaprevir and vx we do not assign our internal costs  such as salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and infrastructure costs  to individual drug candidates  because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs 
these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs  such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research  which we do allocate by individual drug development program 
all research and development costs for our drug candidates are expensed as incurred 
to date  we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development 
the successful development of our drug candidates is 
table of contents highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
in addition  the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
over the three year period ended december   telaprevir has represented the largest portion of the development costs for our clinical drug candidates 
we anticipate that our ongoing phase clinical trials of telaprevir will be completed in mid  but that development costs associated with other clinical trials of telaprevir may continue after the completion of the registration trials 
if we are able to successfully commercialize telaprevir in accordance with current development timelines  we anticipate revenues and cash flows from the sales of telaprevir to commence in if our registration program for vx is successful and completed on the timeline that we currently anticipate  we could submit an nda for vx in the second half of our other drug candidates are less advanced and as a result any estimates regarding development timelines for these drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change  and we cannot at this time make a meaningful estimate when  if ever  these drug candidates  including the drug candidates we acquired from virochem  will generate revenues and cash flows 
research expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services infrastructure costs total research expenses over the past three years we have maintained a relatively level investment in research activities with fluctuations in various categories of expense resulting in a increase in research expenses in as compared to and a increase in research expenses in as compared to our research expenses primarily are related to expenses for our workforce and generally are not dependent on the timing of clinical development activities 
we expect to continue to invest in our research programs in an effort to continue identifying additional drug candidates 

table of contents development expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages development expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services commercial supply investment infrastructure costs total development expenses our development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to primarily as a result of increased expenses related to our workforce partially offset by decreases in our contractual services expenses 
the number of employees in our development group increased by approximately from to our investment in commercial supply of drug candidates  which has fluctuated significantly over the past three years  also increased by million  or  in as compared to overall  we expect development expenses to be significantly higher in than because of significant projected increases in commercial supply investment in telaprevir  and expenses related to the vx registration program and our earlier stage clinical trials  partially offset by decreases in expenses related to our telaprevir registration program 
our development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to this decrease in our development expenses was the result of a million decrease in expenses for commercial supply of drug candidates partially offset by increases in the other categories of development expenses  including expenses related to our increased headcount and infrastructure 
sales  general and administrative expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses increased substantially in each of and as compared to the preceding year as a result of increases in workforce expenses as we advance our drug candidates  particularly telaprevir  into late stage development 
we expect that sales  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in as we continue to increase headcount in our commercial organization to prepare for the potential launch of telaprevir in royalty expenses royalty expenses decreased million  or  in compared to royalty expenses increased million  or  in compared to royalty expenses primarily relate to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the subroyalty expense offsets a corresponding amount of royalty revenues 
we expect to continue to recognize this subroyalty as an expense in future periods 

table of contents restructuring expense as of december   our lease restructuring liability was million 
in  and  we recorded restructuring expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the restructuring expense in all periods included imputed interest cost related to the restructuring liability associated with our kendall square lease 
in and  there were also adjustments of certain estimates and assumptions for the remaining period of the lease commitment that increased the restructuring expense in those periods 
acquisition related expenses we incurred million of expenses in in connection with our acquisition of virochem  including million in transaction expenses and million related to a restructuring of virochem s operations that we undertook in march in order to focus virochem s activities on its hcv assets 
we did not have corresponding acquisition related expenses in or impairment of intangible assets in  we recorded an expense of million in connection with an impairment of the intangible assets related to virochem s development program for vch  a drug candidate for the treatment of hiv infection 
this intangible asset was estimated to have a fair value on the acquisition date of million  based on development costs through the acquisition date 
in the fourth quarter  we determined that vch was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
non operating items interest income interest income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was a result of lower portfolio yields during as compared to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities yielded approximately on an annual basis in compared to approximately on an annual basis in interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was a result of lower portfolio yields during  partially offset by higher average levels of invested funds in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities yielded approximately on an annual basis in compared to approximately in interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a result of a decrease in interest expenses related to our notes from million in to million in partially offset by the interest expenses related to the notes that we issued in september in  we expect the interest expenses related to our notes will be significantly lower than in as a result of the lower outstanding principal amounts of our notes  but that interest expenses related to our notes will be significantly higher in than in interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in this increase in as compared to resulted from the issuance in february of million in aggregate principal amount of notes 

table of contents expense on exchanges of notes into common stock in  we incurred non cash charges of million in connection with the exchanges of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for million newly issued shares of our common stock 
the charges related to the additional  shares of common stock that we issued in excess of the number of shares of common stock into which such notes were convertible prior to the exchanges 
there were no corresponding expenses in or losses on derivative instruments  net in the fourth quarter of  we recorded net losses of million in connection with the embedded and free standing derivatives associated with our september financial transactions 
these net losses primarily are based on a time value of money adjustment to the estimated fair value of the free standing derivative 
we expect to continue to record losses and or gains related to these derivatives in liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  strategic sales of assets or businesses  financial transactions  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
we expect that we will incur substantial expenses in order to complete the development and commercialization of telaprevir while at the same time continuing the development of our other drug candidates and building our other capabilities 
as a result  we may raise additional capital in order to maintain adequate working capital and cash reserves to continue our diversified research  discovery and development efforts 
we expect we would need to raise additional capital if the development of telaprevir were materially delayed 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion  which was an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of financing activities  financial transactions and payments from collaborators that occurred in  including an aggregate of million of net proceeds from the offerings of common stock that we completed in february and december  million we received from two financial transactions that we entered into in september  million we received from mitsubishi tanabe in the third quarter of and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash expenditures we made in related to  among other things  research and development expenses  sales  general and administrative expenses and million in cash that was included as part of the consideration to acquire virochem 
capital expenditures for property and equipment during were million 
during  we reduced the aggregate principal amount of our notes outstanding from million to million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  and we were required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on february and august of each year 
the notes would have matured on february  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
in february  we announced that we would redeem the notes on march  at the redemption prices stated in the indenture related to the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest through march  we expect that the notes will be converted into common stock by the holders prior to the redemption date 

table of contents as a result of a financial transaction entered into in september  we had million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding on december  the notes mature on october   subject to earlier mandatory redemption as specified milestone events under our collaboration with janssen are achieved prior to october  in addition  in september  we sold our rights to receive an additional million of potential future milestone payments that we expect to receive from janssen for the launch of telaprevir in the european union 
as a result of these transactions  the million of potential milestone payments from janssen related to the filing  approval and launch of telaprevir in the european union will not provide us with liquidity in the future  if and when earned  except to the extent that they fund redemption of million in principal amount of our notes 
our accrued restructuring expense of million at december  relates to the portion of the facility that we lease in kendall square that we do not intend to occupy and includes other related lease obligations  recorded at net present value 
in  we made cash payments of million against the accrued expense and received million in sublease rental payments 
during  we expect to make additional cash payments of million against the accrued expense and receive million in sublease rental payments 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in our development pipeline  particularly for clinical trials of telaprevir and vx  in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of telaprevir and vx  and in clinical trials for our other drug candidates  including vx  vx  vx and vx we also expect to maintain our substantial investment in research 
as a result  we expect to incur future losses on a quarterly and annual basis at least until we obtain marketing approval and successfully commercialize a product 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may raise additional capital in order to maintain adequate working capital and cash reserves to continue our diversified research  discovery and development efforts through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements  or other methods of financing 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or drug candidates
