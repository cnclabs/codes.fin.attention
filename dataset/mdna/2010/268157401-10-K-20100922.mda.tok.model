item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
overview our principal business is the design  manufacture  marketing  distribution and sales of physical medicine products and aesthetic products 
we manufacture and distribute a broad line of medical equipment including therapy devices  medical supplies and soft goods  treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment 
our line of aesthetic equipment includes aesthetic massage and microdermabrasion devices  as well as skin care products 
our products are sold to and used primarily by physical therapists  chiropractors  sports medicine practitioners  podiatrists  plastic surgeons  dermatologists  aestheticians and other aesthetic services providers 
we operate on a fiscal year ending june for example  reference to fiscal year refers to the year ended june  recent developments on july   we launched a new e commerce website at www 
dynatronics 
com offering thousands of products online for clinics and medical practitioners  as well as retail customers 
the new  easy to use website targets the physical medicine market and is a key marketing and sales tool which we believe will facilitate sales growth 
the website is an important step for our expansion into the national account and group purchasing organization segments of the market  which require online ordering capability 
in addition  it exposes our products to other new groups of online customers including patients of practitioners who may be interested in purchasing our products 
functionally  the website creates new ways for customers to communicate with us to request information and check on their account status 
customers receive the best pricing on products by ordering online and can track their product shipments and know when their orders will be delivered 
a companion feature to the new website is our new e quote system that allows sales representatives to build quotes for customers quickly and accurately making our sales representatives more efficient and timely in responding to customer needs 
the new website is projected to lead to reduced transaction costs  decreased order entry errors and increased order processing efficiencies  which are expected to boost our competitive edge in the market and  most importantly  improve profitability 
fiscal year was the first full year of selling our new v force vibration therapy device 
this unit employs powerful  whole body vibration technology  which provides neuromuscular training to increase strength  improve balance and enhance flexibility 
whole body vibration therapy has been the subject of extensive research for many years with numerous clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness in the areas of balance fall prevention  circulation  knee rehabilitation  low back pain  range of motion and a host of other neuromuscular conditions 
how we assess the performance of our business we consider a variety of performance and financial measures in assessing the performance of our business 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net sales  gross profit margin and selling  general and administrative expense 
in addition  the status of borrowings and other financial ratios related to the balance sheet help provide insight into how we are performing 
net sales net sales constitute gross sales net of any returns and sales discounts 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
cost of goods sold for manufactured products includes direct material and labor costs as well as allocated indirect costs of labor and overhead 
cost of goods sold for distributed products includes the direct cost of purchased products  distribution center costs  and all freight costs incurred 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other manufacturers or distributors of similar products within our industry 
changes in the mix of our products  such as changes in the proportion of manufactured products  may impact our overall cost of goods sold 
we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving products in inventory 
we may offer incentives or mark downs on these products 
the timing and level of markdowns are not seasonal in nature but are driven by customer acceptance and sales 
if we misjudge the market for our products  we may be faced with excess inventories for some products and be required to mark down those products in order to sell them 
historically markdowns have not been a material factor in our business 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes administration  share based compensation and occupancy costs 
these expenses do not generally vary proportionally with net sales 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters 
share based compensation expense related to stock options was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  and  shares of common stock in fiscal years and  respectively 
these and any future stock option grants will increase our share based compensation expense in fiscal year and in future fiscal years compared to fiscal year see critical accounting policies 
we rely on an operating line of credit from a commercial bank 
the relationship between the borrowing base that establishes maximum borrowings permitted and the actual borrowings indicates available borrowings for financing operations and providing working capital 
ultimately  through profitability and earnings we desire to eliminate all line of credit borrowings 
until that goal is achieved  the available borrowings are carefully monitored as an indicator of keeping proper balances between inventories  receivables  and payables as well as financing capital expenditures 
likewise  maintaining good current ratios and debt to equity ratios is a measure of good financial health and is monitored closely 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased  to  in fiscal year  from  in fiscal year despite the difficult economic conditions in the united states  we generated increased sales of both rehabilitation capital equipment and medical supplies ahead of last year s results 
this is a positive indicator attributable to the aggressive marketing efforts in which we have been engaged and which have been announced during the year as well as possible lessening of recessionary pressures 
sales in some geographic regions of the united states realized significant decreases due to harsher local economies and unemployment 
declining sales in these areas were offset by improved performance in other parts of the country 
without the improvements shown in other regions  these decreases would have diminished sales by approximately when compared to sales in the last two years 
it is notable that the increase in total sales reflects increased sales in other parts of the united states sufficient to not only offset the losses in the more economically depressed areas  but also to boost overall sales by almost year over year 
sales of manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately of our physical medicine product sales in both fiscal years and distribution of products manufactured by other suppliers accounted for the balance of our physical medicine product sales in those years 
sales of manufactured aesthetic products in fiscal years and represented approximately and of our aesthetic product sales  respectively  with distributed products making up the balance 
the majority of our sales revenues come from the sale of physical medicine products  both manufactured and distributed 
in fiscal years and  sales of physical medicine products accounted for of total sales 
chargeable repairs  billable freight revenue  aesthetic product sales and other miscellaneous revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues in and gross profit gross profit increased  to  or of net sales  in fiscal year  from  or of net sales in fiscal year the increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales generated in fiscal year  implementation of a number of refinements to our business operations which lowered our costs through better pricing and terms obtained from vendors  and product mix more favorable to some of our higher margin medical devices  including the new v force device and our electrotherapy products  together with certain medical supply products and treatment tables 
as economic conditions gradually improve  demand for higher margin capital products is expected to increase  which we expect would further improve gross margins in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  to  or of net sales  in fiscal year  from  or of net sales in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a reversal of an accrued liability of approximately  resulting from the cancellation of retirement benefits previously provided by contract to two executive officers  kelvyn cullimore  jr 
and larry beardall 
the benefits were cancelled when the employment agreements in which they were granted were terminated in march both executives subsequently entered into new employment agreements in june the new agreements do not include retirement benefits such as those that had been a part of the terminated agreements 
during fiscal  we were able to reduce sg a by  compared to fiscal sg a costs that included the previously described gain of approximately  this was accomplished through our ongoing cost reduction campaign to improve efficiencies 
over the past two years  we have focused on lowering transaction costs  streamlining customer service and production processes  and improving our sales support functions 
research and development research and development r d expense decreased  to  in fiscal year  from  in r d expense also decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year  to from of net sales in fiscal year r d costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue our commitment to developing innovative products for the physical medicine market in fiscal year and in future periods in order to position us for growth 
we anticipate that r d expense will increase in to approximately  in anticipation of a number of new products currently under development and scheduled for release at the end of fiscal year interest expense interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal year due to lower rates and decreased borrowings and lower carrying balances on our bank line of credit compared to fiscal year during the year  we renegotiated the rate on one of our mortgages and reduced the rate from to 
pre tax income pre tax income improved significantly in fiscal year to  compared to  in fiscal year the improvement in pre tax income for fiscal year was a result of higher sales and gross profit generated during the year  together with lower sg a  r d and interest expenses 
as already mentioned  the profit attained in reflected the effect of the reversal of  in expense associated with the termination of the retirement benefits for kelvyn h 
cullimore jr 
and larry beardall 
income tax expense income tax expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to in the lower tax accrual rate in is primarily the result of tax credits from prior years 
net income net income increased to  
per share in fiscal year  compared to  
per share in fiscal year major factors contributing to the improvement in fiscal year were higher sales and gross profits  together with the reduction in sg a  r d and interest expenses as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through available cash reserves and borrowings under a line of credit with a bank 
working capital was  as of june   inclusive of the current portion of long term obligations and credit facilities  compared to working capital of  as of june  during fiscal  we generated  in cash from operating activities  an increase of  from fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was mainly related to the following factors o the increase in net income due to the factors discussed above o a reduction in the net deferred income tax asset that was approximately  greater in fiscal than the decrease in fiscal  mainly due to the carry back of net operating losses that resulted in an income tax refund of approximately  o a decrease in accounts receivable that was approximately  greater in fiscal than the accounts receivable decrease in fiscal o a decrease in inventory that was approximately  greater in fiscal than the inventory decrease in fiscal these items were offset partially by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  compared to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is due to an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the improvement in cash used in financing activities in is due to a significant reduction in borrowings under the line of credit during fiscal during the year ended june   we were able to reduce the outstanding line of credit balance by  accounts receivable trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  for the past two years  management has placed special emphasis on collecting receivables more timely 
the reduction in trade accounts receivable in is indicative of the success of this effort 
trade accounts receivable represent amounts due from our dealer network as well as from medical practitioners and clinics 
we believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical knowledge and relationship with these customers 
accounts receivable are generally collected within days of the agreed terms 
inventories inventories  net of reserves  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  as expected  inventories decreased following consolidation of eight distribution points to three central distribution facilities following the completion of the acquisitions in fiscal year in addition  the amount of inventory we carry fluctuates each period based on the timing of large inventory purchases from overseas suppliers 
accounts payable accounts payable decreased  or  to  as of june   from  as of june  the decrease in accounts payable is a result of the timing of our weekly payments to suppliers and the timing of purchases of product components 
accounts payable are generally not aged beyond the terms of our suppliers 
we take advantage of available early payment discounts when offered by our vendors 
cash and cash equivalents our cash position as of june  was  an increase of  or  from cash of  as of june  we expect that cash flows from operating activities  together with amounts available through an existing line of credit facility  will be sufficient to cover operating needs in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months 
if we experience an adverse operating environment  including a further worsening of the general economy in the united states  or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
line of credit during fiscal year  we paid down the outstanding balance on our line of credit with a bank by  leaving a remaining balance outstanding of  as of june   compared to  as of june  the current balance on the line of credit is the lowest it has been since the acquisition of six dealers in june and july and down approximately  from the line at its highest point in fiscal year the decrease in the line of credit was primarily the result of improved collections of accounts receivable  lower inventory levels  profits generated during fiscal year and cash flows from operating activities 
in addition  we filed for and received a tax refund of approximately  by carrying back net operating losses against prior year taxes paid as permitted by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act  pl interest on the line of credit is based on the day libor rate as of june  plus 
the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories  as well as a security interest in our headquarters facility in salt lake city  utah 
borrowing limitations are based on approximately of eligible inventory and up to of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum credit facility of  interest payments on the line are due monthly 
as of june   the borrowing base was approximately  resulting in approximately  available on the line 
the line of credit is renewable on december  and includes covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of june   we were in compliance with the loan covenants 
the current ratio was to as of june  compared to to as of june  current assets represented of total assets as of june  and debt long term debt excluding current installments totaled  as of june   compared to  as of june  long term debt is comprised primarily of the mortgage loans on our office and manufacturing facilities in utah and tennessee 
the principal balance on the mortgage loans is approximately  with monthly principal and interest payments of  for a more complete explanation of the long term debt  see note in the financial statements 
inflation and seasonality our revenues and net income from continuing operations have not been unusually affected by inflation or price increases for raw materials and parts from vendors 
our business operations are not materially affected by seasonality factors 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
fasb asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
fasb asu updates the existing multiple element arrangement guidance currently in fasb topic revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this new guidance eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements have objective evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to the items that have already been delivered 
further  companies will be required to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable  even though such deliverables are not sold separately by either the company itself or other vendors 
this new guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the revised guidance will be effective for the first annual period beginning on or after june  the company may elect to adopt the provisions prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning on the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
the company does not expect fasb asu to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
fasb asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  that reduces the types of transactions that fall within the current scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
existing software revenue recognition guidance requires that its provisions be applied to an entire arrangement when the sale of any products or services containing or utilizing software when the software is considered more than incidental to the product or service 
as a result of the amendments included in fasb asu no 
 many tangible products and services that rely on software will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition guidance 
under this new guidance  the following components would be excluded from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance the tangible element of the product  software products bundled with tangible products where the software components and non software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  and undelivered components that relate to software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
fasb asu also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope of software revenue guidance software deliverables and deliverables not within the scope of that guidance non software deliverables 
this guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company may elect to adopt the provisions prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning on the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
however  the company must elect the same transition method for this guidance as that chosen for fasb asu no 
the company does not expect fasb asu to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record finished goods inventory at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual costs first in  first out or market 
raw materials are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation reserves are maintained for the estimated impairment of the inventory 
impairment may be a result of slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence or changes in the valuation of the inventory 
in determining the adequacy of reserves  we analyze the following  among other things o current inventory quantities on hand  o product acceptance in the marketplace  o customer demand  o historical sales  o forecast sales  o product obsolescence  o technological innovations  and o character of the inventory as a distributed item  finished manufactured item or raw material 
any modifications to estimates of inventory valuation reserves are reflected in the cost of goods sold within the statements of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
as of june  and  our inventory valuation reserve balance  which established a new cost basis  was  and  respectively  and our inventory balance was  and  net of reserves  respectively 
revenue recognition historically  the majority of our product sales were to customers who were independent distributors 
in fiscal year  as a result of acquiring six of our top distributors  a significant portion of our sales were generated through our new direct sales force 
our sales force and distributors sell our products to end users  including physical therapists  professional trainers  athletic trainers  chiropractors  medical doctors and aestheticians 
with the acquisition of the key distributors  we effectively reduced our dependence on sales by independent distributors 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped fob shipping point under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed for shipping and handling of products are recorded as sales revenue 
costs for shipping and handling of products to customers are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
deferred income tax assets in august and august  our management performed an in depth analysis of the deferred income tax assets and their recoverability 
based on several factors  including our strong earnings history of pre tax profit averaging over  per year in of the last fiscal years and the fact that the principal causes of the loss in fiscal goodwill impairment and expenses resulting from six acquisitions are considered to be unusual and are not expected to recur in the near future  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
as previously mentioned   of the deferred income tax assets were utilized to carry back against profits from and  reducing the deferred income tax asset by 
business plan and outlook during fiscal year  we achieved significant improvement in our operating results compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  we will continue to pursue a focused strategy to improve sales and overall operations that includes the following elements o strengthening distribution channels by adding direct sales representatives and dealers in key locations o pursuing sales with large chains of clinics and national accounts  including group purchasing organizations o using tools such as e commerce solutions and other it related methodologies to reduce cost of operations and enhance the reach of our sales efforts o enhancing product profit margins through improved manufacturing processes and negotiating better pricing with all vendors o developing and introducing new  state of the art products for future growth o seeking ways to leverage our distribution network to bring new products to market 
our goal in implementing this strategy is to improve short term profitability without jeopardizing long term growth 
the landscape of our primary market  the physical medicine marketplace  continues to change 
past years saw consolidation among manufacturers and distributors including our own acquisitions completed in fiscal years and more recently  two additional significant changes have taken place 
according to its filings under the securities exchange act of  djo  inc closed its chattanooga group operations in the quarter ended july  and redistributed those manufacturing  r d and support functions to other djo facilities  in and out of the united states 
chattanooga group has been a primary competitor of the company for many years 
the effect of this announcement is that the full operations of the former chattanooga group have been reduced to a product brand sold by djo through non proprietary distribution channels 
in addition  djo  inc has disclosed that on june  it sold its empi therapy solutions catalog division to patterson medical sammons preston  another competitor of the company 
this essentially eliminates empi as a significant catalog competitor and further reduces competition in our market 
these consolidations combined with prior year consolidations and continuing declines in the number of independent distributors have significantly narrowed distribution channels in our market 
at the present time  we believe that there remain only two companies with a national direct sales force selling proprietary and distributed products dynatronics and patterson medical through its sammons preston subsidiary 
all other distribution in our market is directed through catalog companies with no direct sales force  or through independent local dealers 
however  the network of local independent dealers is rapidly diminishing due to consolidation efforts and increased competition from dynatronics  sammons preston and catalog companies 
in the past year  we have reinforced our direct sales team to include direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
in addition to these direct sales representatives  we continue to enjoy a strong relationship with scores of local dealers 
we believe we have the best trained and most knowledgeable sales force in the industry 
the recent changes within our market provide a unique opportunity for us to grow market share in the coming years through recruitment of high quality sales representatives and dealers 
with the broad line of products we now offer and with a strong sales force that we expect will grow stronger in the coming year  we believe that we are well positioned to develop relationships with large chains of clinics and hospitals  national accounts and group purchasing organizations gpo s that purchase only on contract 
this is a segment of business which was previously closed to us because we were not an approved vendor with the various gpo s and national or regional chains of care facilities 
with the broader offering of products now available through our catalog  we are better able to compete for this high volume business and have seen success this past year in becoming the preferred vendor to many national and regional accounts 
to further our efforts to recruit high quality direct sales representatives and dealers as well as to better appeal to the large gpo s and national customers  we will continue to improve efficiencies of our operations and the sales support for the industry 
chief among those changes was the introduction of our first true e commerce solution on july  with the introduction of this e commerce solution  customers are able to more easily place orders and obtain information about their accounts 
sales representatives are increasing their effectiveness with the abundance of information available to them electronically through our e quote system which is a companion to the e commerce solution introduced 
not only is our e commerce solution improving sales  but it should also permit us to reduce our transactional costs thus enabling us to accommodate higher sales without significantly increasing overhead 
the recent passage of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and educational reconciliation act is sure to have an effect on our future operations 
the addition of millions to the rolls of the insured will undoubtedly increase demand for services 
that increased demand is expected to translate into increased sales of our products 
the magnitude of those increases is difficult to assess at this time 
at the same time  this legislation will impose an excise tax on all manufacturers of medical devices which we estimate will exceed  annually for dynatronics based on the current statutory language 
because the effects of this legislation will not be felt until at the earliest  it is difficult to project the full impact this legislation will have  especially since there is a likelihood of amendments to the legislation prior to it becoming fully effective 
in the meantime  we are working to take full advantage of every opportunity presented by this legislation to increase sales and to offset any negative effects that may accompany those opportunities 
we will continue to focus on new product innovation 
the introduction of v force in june once again demonstrates our commitment to innovation as we were the first to introduce this technology to the rehabilitation markets we serve 
several new products are currently under development and are scheduled for introduction toward the end of fiscal year the commitment to innovation of high quality products has been a hallmark of dynatronics and will continue throughout the coming year 
economic pressures from the recent recession not only have affected available credit that would facilitate large capital purchases  but have also reduced demand for discretionary services such as those provided by our aesthetic products 
as a result  we trimmed back our expenses in the synergie division to be more reflective of the current environment 
fortunately  the synergie elite aesthetic product line introduced in april continues to have appeal due to its design and price point 
we believe that our aesthetic devices remain the best value on the market 
we are seeking innovative ways to market our products including strategic partnerships  both domestic and international  to help regain sales momentum 
as the economy begins to improve over the coming year  we expect to see increased sales of these higher margin products 
we have long believed that international markets present an untapped potential for growth and expansion 
adding new distributors in several countries will be the key to this expansion effort 
our past efforts to improve international marketing have yielded only marginal improvements 
we remain committed  however  to finding the most cost effective ways to expand our markets internationally 
over the coming year our efforts will be focused on partnering with key manufacturers and distributors interested in our product line or technology 
our utah operation  where all electrotherapy  ultrasound  traction  light therapy and synergie products are manufactured  is certified to iso  an internationally recognized standard of excellence in medical device manufacturing 
this designation is an important requirement in obtaining the ce mark certification  which allows us to market our products in the european union and other international locations 
refining our business model for supporting sales representatives and distributors also will be a focal point of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient ways to maintain our satellite sales offices and warehouses 
in addition  more emphasis is being placed on pricing management to protect margins for both manufactured and distributed products 
the ongoing refinement of this model is expected to yield further efficiencies that will better achieve sales goals while at the same time reduce expenses 
we have identified over  of efficiency improvements that have already been implemented or that we plan to implement over the coming quarters to drive greater profitability 
with the sale of our manufactured capital equipment being the largest contributor to margin generation  we have placed renewed emphasis on improving manufacturing operations  including considering more offshore manufacturing of components as well as streamlining manufacturing operations in utah and tennessee 
past experience has shown that when recessionary pressures start to subside  the pent up demand for capital equipment can be significant 
with the recent increase in capital equipment sales  we believe we are seeing the beginning of this positive trend 
our recent efforts to prudently reduce costs during the difficult times have made us a leaner operation and well positioned for a continued ramp up in demand 
based on our defined strategic initiatives  we are focusing our resources in the following areas o reinforcing distribution through a strategy of recruiting direct sales representatives and working closely with the most successful distributors of capital equipment 
o improving sales by focusing sales strategies on pursuing business opportunities with large chains of clinics  national and regional accounts  and group purchasing organizations 
o using our first e commerce solution in order to facilitate business opportunities and reduce transactional costs 
o significantly improving operational efficiencies through implementation of ideas generated by the operational analysis conducted with the help of vici capital partners 
these ideas include lowering manufacturing and transactional costs  automating processes  redefining policies and procedures and working to make every customer a profitable customer 
o strengthening pricing management and procurement methodologies 
o minimizing expense associated with the synergie product line until the economy improves and demand for capital equipment re emerges  and  in the meantime  seeking additional independent distributors and strategic partnerships 
o focusing international sales efforts on identifying key distributors and strategic partners who could represent the company s product line  particularly in europe 
o continuing development of new  state of the art products  both high tech and commodity  in fiscal year  for both the rehabilitation and aesthetic markets 
o exploring strategic business alliances that will leverage and complement the company s competitive strengths  increase market reach and supplement capital resources
