table of contents current economic and operating environment due to a number of factors affecting consumers  including a slowdown in global economies  contracting credit markets  reduced consumer spending  and us political leadership  the outlook for the gaming  travel and entertainment industries both domestically and abroad continues to remain highly uncertain 
auto traffic into las vegas  airline capacity and air travel to mccarran international airport have continued to decline year over year  resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms 
this slow down was particularly significant in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout  most significantly affecting our us operations 
based on our experience over this past year and current market conditions  we believe that our las vegas operations will continue to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates  room rates  casino volumes and departmental profitability 
significant new supply in las vegas will put additional pressure on occupancy and room rates during as a result of the current economic and market conditions  we have focused on efficiency initiatives that we began implementing at both of our properties and corporate offices in early these initiatives include reductions in pay for certain salaried employees  reduced work weeks for full time hourly employees  a reduction of certain bonus accruals and a suspension of the employer match to the k plan 
we continually review the cost structure of our operating properties and corporate offices to identify further opportunities to reduce costs 
in addition to the slowing global economy  wynn macau was adversely affected during by certain visa restrictions implemented in september results of operations our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the year ended december  includes encore at wynn las vegas for a full year  whereas included only days of operations for encore at wynn las vegas 
we also believe that our operating results at both properties for the years ended december  and  were adversely impacted by the weakened global economy 
disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have and are likely to continue to adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  as noted above  visa restrictions have placed certain limitations on visitation to macau 
the table below displays our net revenues for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands for the years ended december  net revenues wynn las vegas  including encore wynn macau total net revenues reliance on only two properties in two geographic regions for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more diversified  may be better able to control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in two properties  many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented 
there are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry 
in las vegas and in the general casino at wynn macau  customers primarily purchase gaming chips from gaming tables 
the cash and net markers used to 
table of contents purchase the gaming chips from gaming tables are deposited in the gaming table s drop box 
this is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our las vegas operations and in the general casino at wynn macau for calculating win percentage 
in our vip casino at wynn macau  customers primarily purchase non negotiable rolling chips from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage 
non negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers 
winning wagers are paid in cash chips 
the loss of the non negotiable rolling chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for measuring vip casino win percentage 
because of this difference in chip purchase activity  the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the vip casino 
it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method 
the measurement method in las vegas and in the general casino at wynn macau effectively tracks the initial purchase of chips while the measurement method in the vip casino at wynn macau effectively tracks the sum of all losing wagers 
accordingly  the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than the general casino 
as a result  the expected win percent with the same amount of gaming win numerator is smaller in the vip casino at wynn macau when compared to the general casino in las vegas and macau 
even though both use the same measurement method  we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in las vegas versus macau 
this difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games between the two casinos 
each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage 
the life to date table games win percentage for our las vegas operations is whereas the life to date table games win percentage for the general casino at wynn macau is below are definitions of the statistics discussed table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue 
drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table s drop box 
turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our wynn macau vip program 
rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track vip wagering volume turnover for purposes of calculating incentives 
slot win is the amount of handle representing the total amount wagered that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue 
average daily rate adr is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms occupied 
revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms available 
financial results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as noted earlier  our financial results for the year ended december  are not comparable to the year ended december   as the year ended december  includes the operations of encore at wynn las vegas which opened on december   whereas the prior year includes only days of encore at wynn las vegas

casino revenues at wynn macau decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the prior year

our win as a percent of turnover was  which was within the expected range of to  and compares to in our vip casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non rolling chip play in that segment 
in our general casino at wynn macau  drop decreased when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was  which was above the expected range of to 
the average table games win percentage in the general casino at wynn macau for the year ended december  was 
slot handle at wynn macau increased compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of to 
the increase in slot handle was primarily due to the play of high end slot customers

although we added new retail outlets at encore at wynn las vegas  overall retail revenues in las vegas were flat 
retail revenues at wynn macau increased approximately million due primarily to increased sales at several retail outlets and the opening of wynn and co 
watches and jewelry  which sells cartier  jaeger le coultre  and kwiat products 
entertainment revenues decreased over the prior year primarily due to the closure of the spamalot production show at wynn las vegas in july this decrease was offset in part by revenue from headliner acts that performed during  including garth brooks  who began performing in the encore theater in december departmental  administrative and other expenses during the year ended december   departmental expenses include casino expense of  million  rooms expense of million  food and beverage expense of million  and entertainment  retail and other expense of million

during the year ended december   departmental expenses include casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment and retail and other expenses of million 
also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately million and approximately million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
casino expenses have decreased during the year ended december   due to a decrease in casino revenues especially at wynn macau where a gaming tax of is the significant driver of expense in that department 
room  food and beverage and general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the opening of encore at wynn las vegas in december entertainment  retail and other expense increased primarily in the entertainment department due to headliner performances during the year 
our provision for doubtful accounts receivable declined during the year ended december   compared to the prior year due to recent strong collection trends on our casino accounts receivable 
this strength has allowed us to reduce the additional reserves we recorded in the third quarter of pre opening costs during the year ended december   we incurred pre opening costs of million compared to million for the year ended december  pre opening costs incurred during the year ended december  were related to encore at wynn macau 
pre opening costs incurred during the year ended december  were related to encore at wynn las vegas which opened in december we expect that pre opening costs related to encore at wynn macau will accelerate as we approach opening in april depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   of million increased by million when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to depreciation of the assets of encore at wynn las vegas which were placed into service in december during the construction of our properties  costs incurred in the construction of the buildings  improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations are capitalized 
once these properties opened  their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense 
depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets 
in addition  we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment  intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted 

table of contents the maximum useful life of assets at wynn macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession  which currently expire in june and  respectively 
consequently  depreciation related to wynn macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations

property charges and other for the year ended december  were million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  property charges and other for the year ended december  included the following a a million charge for the abandonment of the front porte cochere at encore at wynn las vegas to make way for an addition to that property  b a million charge for the write off of aircraft deposits  and c million related to miscellaneous remodels  abandonments and loss on sale of equipment

we expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts 
other non operating costs and expenses interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased million primarily due to a significant decrease in the average interest rates earned on invested cash balances compared to the prior year
