consequences and challenges of the economic environment on our business the sharp contraction in the us economy that began in the second half of fiscal and continued through has had a significant and continuing impact on our business 
the effects of this economic recession have presented significantly greater challenges than we previously anticipated  accelerating downward pressures on our revenues  margins  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect the ongoing impact of the economic recession to continue to impact us and our customers into fiscal and expect operating losses to continue through the first half of fiscal the objectives of our strategic plan call for us to emerge as a stronger  more institutionally mature business that can serve as a platform for future growth 
however  if the economic downturn worsens or extends significantly into the future or we are unsuccessful in executing on the objectives of our strategic plan  we would expect to incur additional losses from operations and reductions in our cash flows and liquidity 
c 
fiscal strategic plan our primary goal for fiscal is to achieve profitability and return value to our shareholders 
in order to achieve that goal  our fiscal strategy emphasizes growing our core it staffing business  accelerating the execution of sales and recruiting  controlling costs and delivering profitable financial results

our objective is to have  billable consultants by the end of fiscal this increase in billable staff will require us to execute on our sales strategy  build world class recruiting capabilities and expand our low cost sourcing model 
achieve industry standard gross margin rates in fiscal  we increased our gross margin rate basis points to 
in fiscal  we will implement pricing and margin policies and procedures that are designed to continue to increase our gross margin rates

overview of fiscal results during fiscal  we focused on increasing our mix of higher margin services  exiting low margin  non core lines of business  such as the var and mcs  and restructuring our back office operations to reduce our selling  administrative and other expenses 
for fiscal  our revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to the negative impact the economic environment has had on the demand for our it professional services and our planned exit from non core and low margin lines of business 
gross margins as a percent of revenue increased due to the impact of implementing our strategy of exiting low margin lines of business and accounts and the reduction in lower margin product sales

this category of expense as a percentage of direct services revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the impact of customer bill rate reductions without offsetting consultant pay rate reductions 
cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of services provided through subsuppliers represents the cost of third parties to fulfill the obligations to our customers 
this category of expense as a percentage of revenue for services provided through subsuppliers was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in expense as a percentage of subsupplier revenue was primarily due to the retention of a higher margin client relationship in fiscal versus fiscal cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost when we resell technology hardware and software 
this category of expense  as a percentage of product sales  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the reduction of lower margin commodity hardware sales between the comparable periods 
due to the sale of the assets of the var operations on august   we no longer resell technology hardware and software and  thus  we do not expect to incur this category of costs in the future

table of contents goodwill impairment in fiscal  we determined that events and changes in circumstances had occurred in our business that would indicate the remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  was impaired 
our forecast for operating results for future periods had declined and we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  we determined it was likely that a reduction in fair value of our reporting units had occurred 
given these indicators of potential impairment  we performed an impairment evaluation as of january  which considered these changes in circumstances 
based upon the results of this analysis  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million of our remaining goodwill balance 
impairment of intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our customer lists in accordance with fasb sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets codified in fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment based on the expectation that the business with which the customer lists are associated would be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life 
additionally  in determining fair value  we considered the expected consideration to be received from the sale of the var assets  which implied the customer lists were impaired 
based on this measurement  we recorded a million impairment loss  which is the amount by which the carrying value of the customer lists exceeded the fair value 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to our customer lists 
this category of expense decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the sequoianet 
com trade name and a related customer list becoming fully amortized during fiscal  the impairment of intangible assets recorded in fiscal and the sale of the assets of the var operations on august  whereby we disposed of the remaining balance of our customer lists intangible asset 
non operating income non operating income decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of less interest income earned from our cash balances due to lower interest rates and lower interest income earned related to a customer equipment lease

we recorded no additional income tax expense or benefit because any tax expense or benefit which would otherwise have been recorded has been negated by adjusting the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if  however  we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets  which are currently reserved  becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse the existing valuation allowance to realize the benefit of these assets

we believe our existing working capital and availability under our revolving line of credit the credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo will be sufficient to support the cash flow needs of our business in fiscal continuing operating losses  an increase in bad debt experience from our clients  a lengthening of payment terms from our clients  or significant costs associated with additional restructuring activities could create a need for additional working capital 
an inability to obtain additional working capital  should it be required  could have a material adverse effect on our business

extinguishment expenses of  relating to the remaining deferred financing costs and transaction related expenses were expensed in the third quarter of fiscal and are included within sg a in the consolidated statements of operations 
on august   we entered into and closed on an asset sale agreement for our var operations

contractual obligations we have entered into arrangements that represent certain commitments and have arrangements with certain contingencies 
we lease office facilities under non cancelable operating leases  are engaged in license agreements with future commitments  and have deferred compensation that is payable to participants in accordance with the terms of our restated special executive retirement plan and other agreements

minimum future obligations on operating leases net of sublease contracts  license agreements  and deferred compensation as of january   are as follows in thousands year years years over years total line of credit operating leases maintenance agreements capital lease obligations deferred compensation total critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our 
table of contents financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the estimates described below are the most sensitive estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements 
deferred tax assets realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
realization of our net deferred tax assets also requires the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the federal and state net operating loss carry forward benefits 
in evaluating net deferred tax assets  we are required to make critical accounting estimates regarding our future operating results 
these estimates are based on management s current expectations but involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts in each reporting period  we determine the reserve required to address potentially uncollectible accounts 
an evaluation of the risk associated with a client s ability to make contractually required payments is used to determine this reserve 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include reviewing the financial stability of the client  the client s ability to pay and current market conditions 
if our evaluation of a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future charges 
accrual of unreported medical claims in each reporting period  we estimate an amount to accrue for medical costs incurred but not yet reported under our self funded employee medical insurance plan 
we base our determination on an evaluation of past rates of claim payouts and trends in the amount of payouts 
this determination requires significant judgment and assumes past patterns are representative of future payment patterns and that we have identified any trends in our claim experience 
a significant shift in usage and payment patterns within our medical plans could necessitate significant adjustments to these accruals in future accounting periods 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties or affect significant line items within our financial statements and potentially result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
goodwill statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible codified in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other herein referred to as asc topic prohibits companies from amortizing purchased goodwill 
instead  we have examined our goodwill at least annually to determine if impairment has occurred 
in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill as of the last day of our monthly accounting period for august in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining balance of our goodwill 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets consisted of customer lists 
we evaluate our customer lists for possible impairment whenever indicators of impairment existed 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or the disposal of long lived assets  codified in fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment herein referred to as asc topic requires that if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  then the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets of our var operation  the primary asset of which was the remaining balance of our intangible assets customer lists 
restructuring costs and other severance related costs we believe our current estimates regarding severance  other severance related expenses and lease obligations are adequate  however  our inability to sublet the remaining space  negotiate early termination agreements or obtain payments from sub leases could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates in the future 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue as services are performed 
this includes staffing services  technology integration services  and outsourcing and advisory services that are billed on an hourly basis 
for product sales  except in rare circumstances  we act as the primary obligor in the transaction 
accordingly  except for those rare situations where net revenue reporting is appropriate because we are acting as an agent in the sale of product  product revenue is recorded for the gross amount of the transaction when the products are delivered 
certain of our outsourcing and help desk engagements provide for a specific level of service each month for which we bill a standard monthly fee 
revenue for these engagements is recognized in monthly installments over the period of the contract 
in some such contracts we invoice in advance for two or more months of service 
when we do this  the revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the contractual agreement 
in certain situations  we will contract to sell both product including third party software and or hardware and services in a single client arrangement with multiple deliverables 
these arrangements are generally to resell certain products and to provide the service necessary to install such products and optimize functionality of such products 
we account for multiple deliverable arrangements involving third party software products under the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition codified in fasb asc topic  software and have established vendor specific objective evidence of each deliverable 
other non software related multiple deliverable arrangements are accounted for utilizing the guidelines of etif  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables codified in fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
we account for each of the components of multiple deliverable arrangements separately by using the identified fair values of each component to allocate the total consideration of the arrangement to the separate components 
in certain client situations  where the nature of the engagement requires it  we utilize the services of other companies in our industry 
if these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs  we classify the amount billed to the client as subsupplier revenue 
these revenues  however  are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client 
all revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other independent contractors working directly for us are recorded as direct revenue 
we periodically enter into fixed price engagements 
when we enter into such an engagement  revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on time and materials input to date and 
table of contents estimate time and materials to complete the project 
this method of revenue recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of the engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
income taxes we file a consolidated income tax return in the us federal jurisdiction 
we also file consolidated or separate company income tax returns in most states  canada federal  ontario province and the united kingdom 
as of january   there are no federal  state  and foreign income tax audits in progress 
we are no longer subject to us federal audits for tax years before  and with few exceptions  the same for state and local audits 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a portion  or all  of our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no
