recent developments during july  we opened a full service branch in gresham  texas  just south of tyler  replacing a loan production office we have operated for several years in close proximity 
we are in the process of building a full service branch on the west side of tyler on highway  which we anticipate will open during the second half of in addition  we are building a new facility adjacent to our headquarters in tyler which will house our trust department 
it is anticipated to be completed during the second half of we are also in the process of opening a full service bank in a leased space in a grocery store in tyler  texas 
it is anticipated to open during the second quarter of we continue to explore opportunities to expand into either additional grocery store or traditional branch locations 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a core banking computer system conversion 
this new system should provide for our core computer system needs for many years 
market area we consider our primary market area to be all of smith  gregg  tarrant  travis  cherokee  anderson  kaufman  henderson and wood counties in texas  and to a lesser extent  portions of adjoining counties 
our expectation is that our presence in all of the market areas we serve should continue to grow in the future 
in addition  we continue to explore new markets in which we believe we can expand successfully 
the principal economic activities in our market areas include retail  distribution  manufacturing  medical services  education and oil and gas industries 
additionally  the industry base includes conventions and tourism  as well as retirement relocation 
these economic activities support a growing regional system of medical service  retail and education centers

the banking industry in texas the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control 
during the last twenty years the texas economy has continued to diversify  decreasing the overall impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices  however  the oil and gas industry is still a significant component of the texas economy 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  as oil prices declined significantly and consumers all across the united states were impacted even more severely by the economic slowdown  our market areas began to experience a greater slowdown in economic activity 
during  our market areas experienced the effects of the housing led slowdown that impacted the other regions of the united states 
some economists believe the national recession ended in the latter part of however  we are well aware that any economic recovery could be uneven 
we cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
competition the activities we are engaged in are highly competitive 
financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  insurance companies  brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market 
during  the number of financial institutions in our market areas increased  a trend that we expect will continue 
brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks 
legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition we face 
federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities  combined with tax free status  to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business 
the tax free status granted to credit unions provides them with a significant competitive advantage 
many of the largest banks operating in texas  including some of the largest banks in the country  have offices in our market areas 
many of these institutions have capital resources  broader geographic markets  and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to us 
we face competition from institutions that offer products and services we do not or cannot currently offer 
some institutions we compete with offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that we are unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns 
we expect the level of competition to continue to increase 
employees at february   we employed approximately full time equivalent persons 
none of the employees are represented by any unions or similar groups  and we have not experienced any type of strike or labor dispute 
we consider the relationship with our employees to be good

supervision and regulation general banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
as bank holding companies under federal law  southside bancshares  inc the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  southside delaware financial corporation  collectively  the holding companies are subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve 
as a texas chartered state bank  southside bank is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the texas department of banking tdb  as its chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer 
this system of regulation and supervision applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund dif and the public rather than our shareholders and creditors 
the earnings of southside bank and  therefore  the earnings of the holding companies  are affected by general economic conditions  changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities  including those referenced above 
proposals to change the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels 
current proposals include an extensive restructuring of the regulatory framework within which we operate 
the likelihood  timing  and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty 
set forth below is a brief description of the significant federal and state laws and regulations to which we are currently subject 
these descriptions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision 
holding company regulation as bank holding companies regulated under the bank holding company act of bhca  as amended  the holding companies are registered with and subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve 
the holding companies are required to file annual and other reports with  and furnish information to  the federal reserve  which makes periodic inspections of the holding companies 
permitted activities 
under the bhca  a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in  or acquire direct or indirect control of more than percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities banking or managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries  and any activity that the federal reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking  including o factoring accounts receivable  o making  acquiring  brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities  o leasing personal or real property  o operating a nonbank depository institution  such as a savings association  o performing trust company functions  o conducting financial and investment advisory activities  o conducting discount securities brokerage activities  o underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments  o providing specified management consulting and counseling activities  o performing selected data processing services and support services  o acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions  and o performing selected insurance underwriting activities 
the federal reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company s continued ownership  activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries 
under the bhca  a bank holding company meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a financial holding company 
a financial holding company and companies under its control may engage in activities that are financial in nature  as defined by the gramm leach bliley act glba and federal reserve interpretations  and therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than those permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
financial activities specifically include insurance brokerage and underwriting  securities underwriting and dealing  merchant banking  investment advisory and lending activities 
financial holding companies and their subsidiaries also may engage in additional activities that are determined by the federal reserve  in consultation with the treasury department  to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity or are determined by the federal reserve unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities 
the holding companies have not sought financial holding company status 
however  there can be no assurance that they will not make such an election in the future 
if the holding companies were to elect financial holding company status  southside bank and any other insured depository institution controlled by the holding companies would have to be well capitalized  well managed  and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act discussed below 
capital adequacy 
each of the federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve and the fdic  has issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to the banking organizations they supervise 
the agencies risk based guidelines define a three tier capital framework 
tier capital principally consists of shareholder s equity less any amounts of goodwill  other intangible assets  interest only strips receivables  deferred tax assets  non financial equity investments and other items that are required to be deducted by the federal reserve 
perpetual  non cumulative preferred stock  certain trust preferred securities  and certain minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries also may be included in tier capital 
tier capital principally consists of perpetual and trust preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  mandatorily convertible debt  limited amounts of term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock  and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan and lease losses  and other adjustments 
tier capital includes subordinated debt that is unsecured  fully paid  has an original maturity of at least two years  is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval by the federal reserve and includes a lock in clause precluding payment of either interest or principal if the payment would cause the issuing bank s risk based capital ratio to fall or remain below the requirement minimum 
the sum of tier and tier capital less investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents qualifying total capital 
risk based capital ratios are calculated by dividing  as appropriate  total capital and tier capital by risk weighted assets 
assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk weights  based primarily on relative credit risk 
under these risk based capital requirements  the holding companies and southside bank are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
to the extent we engage in trading activities  we are required to adjust our risk based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices of covered trading positions in trading accounts  or from foreign exchange or commodity positions  whether or not in trading accounts  including changes in interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices 
any capital required to be maintained under these provisions may consist of tier capital 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve and the fdic  also have established minimum leverage capital requirements for the banking organizations they supervise 
these requirements provide that banking organizations that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  are expected to maintain a minimum tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to to basis points above this stated minimum 
holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the federal reserve also continues to consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity 
in  the basel committee on banking supervision published a new set of risk based capital standards basel ii in order to update the original international capital standards that had been put in place in basel i 
basel ii adopts a three pillar framework comprised of minimum capital requirements  supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and market discipline 
basel ii provides several options for determining capital requirements for credit and operational risk 
in december  the agencies adopted a final rule implementing basel ii s advanced approach 
the final rule became effective on april  compliance with the final rule is mandatory only for core banks us banking organizations with over billion in banking assets or on balance sheet foreign exposures of at least billion 
other us banking organizations that meet applicable qualification requirements may elect  but are not required  to comply with the final rule 
the final rule also allows a banking organization s primary federal regulator to determine that application of the rule would not be appropriate in light of the organization s asset size  level of complexity  risk profile or scope of operations 
in july  in order to address the potential competitive inequalities resulting from the now bifurcated risk based capital system in the united states  the agencies agreed to issue a proposed rule that would provide non core banks with the option to adopt an approach consistent with basel ii s standardized approach 
at this time  us banking organizations not subject to the final rule are required to continue to use the existing basel i risk based capital rules 
the holding companies are not required  and have not elected  to comply with the final rule 
increases in regulatory capital requirements appear to be likely  but the federal regulators have not identified specific increases 
in september  the treasury department released a set of principles for financial regulatory reform  including a general recommendation for increased capital for banks and bank holding companies across the board with even higher requirements for systemically risky banking organizations 
in december  the basel committee on board supervision issued proposals for regulatory capital changes  including greater emphasis on common equity as a component of tier capital 
both sets of proposals also recommend enhanced leverage and liquidity requirements 
the ratios of tier capital  total capital to risk adjusted assets  and leverage capital of the company and southside bank as of december   are shown in the following table 
capital adequacy ratios regulatory minimums regulatory minimums to be well capitalized southside bancshares  inc southside bank risk based capital ratios tier capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio common shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale  unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges  net of deferred income taxes  plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities  less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes  and certain nonfinancial equity investments  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
the sum of tier capital  a qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses  qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
tier capital computed as a percentage of fourth quarter average assets less nonqualifying intangibles and certain nonfinancial equity investments 
source of strength 
federal reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength and to take measures to preserve and protect bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted 
as a result  a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under regulatory rules 
any loans from the holding company to its subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to the bank s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank 
see also bank regulation prompt corrective action 
dividends 
the principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from southside bank 
southside bank is subject to federal and state restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to southside delaware financial corporation  the direct parent of southside bank  which in turn may affect the ability of southside delaware to pay dividends to the company 
we must pay essentially all of our operating expenses from funds we receive from southside bank 
therefore  shareholders may receive dividends from us only to the extent that funds are available after payment of our operating expenses 
consistent with its source of strength policy  the federal reserve discourages bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of operating earnings and prefers that dividends be paid only if  after the payment  the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
change in control 
subject to certain exceptions  under the bhca and the change in bank control act cbca  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  persons who intend to acquire direct or indirect control of a depository institution  must give days prior notice to the appropriate federal banking agency 
with respect to the holding companies  control is conclusively presumed to exist where an acquiring party directly or indirectly owns  controls or has the power to vote at least of our voting securities 
under the federal reserve s cbca regulations  a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where  after the transaction  the acquiring party owns  controls or has the power to vote at least but less than of our voting securities 
on september   the federal reserve issued a policy statement on minority equity investments in banks and bank holding companies  that permits investors to acquire up to percent of the total equity of a target bank or bank holding company  subject to certain conditions  including that the acquiring investor does not acquire percent or more of any class of voting securities  and designate at least one director  without triggering the various regulatory requirements associated with control 
acquisitions 
the bhca provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve i for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company  ii for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company or iii in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
regulatory examination 
federal and state banking agencies require the holding companies and southside bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures 
southside bank  and in some cases the holding companies and any nonbank affiliates  must undergo regular on site examinations by the appropriate banking agency 
a bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution  and the results of the examination are confidential 
the cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined organization as the agency deems necessary or appropriate 
the fdic has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities  to the extent feasible and practicable  in any balance sheet  financial statement  report of condition or any other report 
enforcement authority 
the federal reserve has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries and has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute knowing or reckless violations of laws or regulations 
these powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders  civil money penalties or other actions 
civil money penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues

permitted activities and investments 
under the federal deposit insurance act fdia  the activities and investments of state nonmember banks are generally limited to those permissible for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
with fdic approval  a state nonmember bank may engage in activities not permissible for a national bank if the fdic determines that the activity does not pose a significant risk to the dif and that the bank meets its minimum capital requirements 
similarly  under texas law  a state bank may engage in those activities permissible for national banks domiciled in texas 
the tdb may permit a texas state bank to engage in additional activities so long as the performance of the activity by the bank would not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank 
brokered deposits 
southside bank also may be restricted in its ability to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits  depending on its capital classification 
only well capitalized banks are permitted to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
undercapitalized banks generally may not accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
loans to one borrower 
under texas law  without the approval of the tdb and subject to certain limited exceptions  the maximum aggregate amount of loans that southside bank is permitted to make to any one borrower is of tier capital

in general  any such extensions of credit must i not exceed certain dollar limitations  ii be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
additional restrictions are imposed on extensions of credit to executive officers 
certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank s board of directors 
deposit insurance 
the deposits of southside bank are insured by the dif of the fdic  up to the applicable limits established by law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the dif 
in february  the fdic adopted a long term dif restoration plan  as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increases base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from to within seven years 
banks in the best risk category  paid initial base rates ranging from to basis points of assessable deposits beginning april   partially up from the initial base rate range of to basis points 
additionally  the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a special emergency assessment to all financial institutions of basis points of insured deposits as of june  our special emergency assessment totaled million and was collected on september  currently  initial base rate assessments for all fdic insured institutions range from to basis points  with assessment rates of to basis points for banks in the best risk category 
in november  the fdic issued a rule that required all insured depository institutions  with limited exceptions  to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in december  we paid million in prepaid risk based assessments  which included  related to the fourth quarter of that would have otherwise been payable in the first quarter of and is included in deposit insurance expense for the remaining million in prepaid deposit insurance is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the resolution trust corporation

in conjunction with the increased deposit insurance coverage  insurance assessments also increase 
southside bank has not opted out of the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
in may  the fdic deposit insurance limits provision which was set to expire on december  was extended until december  under the helping families save their homes act of capital adequacy 
see holding company regulation capital adequacy 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdicia requires the federal banking agencies  including the fdic  to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within these categories 
under such systems  federal banking regulators are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of the five capital categories described 
the fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations  management and capital distributions  as the classification of a bank or thrift deteriorates 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a depository institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee the bank s compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
the bank currently meets the criteria for well capitalized 
within the prompt corrective action regulations  the federal banking agencies also have established procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
specifically  a federal banking agency may  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality  management  earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination 
the fdic may not  however  reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and  under certain conditions  the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
standards for safety and soundness 
the fdia also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe  by regulation or guideline  operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to i internal controls  ii information systems and internal audit systems  iii loan documentation  iv credit underwriting  v interest rate risk exposure  and vi asset quality 
the agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality  earnings  and stock valuation  as well as standards for compensation  fees and benefits 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines to implement these required standards 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
under the regulations  if the fdic determines that southside bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines  it may require southside bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance  consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 
dividends 
all dividends paid by southside bank are paid to the company  as the sole indirect shareholder of southside bank  through southside delaware financial corporation 
the ability of southside bank  as a texas state bank  to pay dividends is restricted under federal and state law and regulations 
as an initial matter  the fdicia and the regulations of the fdic generally prohibit an insured depository institution from making a capital distribution including payment of dividend if  thereafter  the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized 
under texas law  southside bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the texas banking commissioner 
all dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including losses and provisions for loan losses 
southside bank s general dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations 
southside bank s dividend policies are subject to the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon such factors as future earnings  financial conditions  cash needs  capital adequacy  compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions 
the exact amount of future dividends paid by southside bank will be a function of its general profitability which cannot be accurately estimated or assured  applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of its board of directors 
transactions with affiliates 
southside bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra and the federal reserve s regulation w  as made applicable to state nonmember banks by section j of the fdia 
sections a and b of the fra restrict a bank s ability to engage in certain transactions with its affiliates 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
in a holding company context  the parent bank holding company and any companies controlled by such parent holding company are generally affiliates of the bank 
specifically  section a places limits on the amount of covered transactions  which include loans or extensions of credit to  and investments in or certain other transactions with  affiliates 
it also limits the amount of any advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates 
the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to percent of the bank s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and percent for all affiliates 
additionally  within the foregoing limitations  each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the type of collateral 
further  banks are prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from an affiliate 
section b  among other things  prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound  regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates 
anti tying regulations 
under the bhca and federal reserve s regulations  a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers 
in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these products or services on the condition that either i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank  the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or ii the customer not obtain credit  property  or service from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
a bank may  however  offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 
also  certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act cra  southside bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with safe and sound banking practices  to help meet the needs of our entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for banks nor does it limit a bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
on a periodic basis  the fdic is charged with preparing a written evaluation of our record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
banks are rated based on their actual performance in meeting community credit needs 
the fdic will take that rating into account in its evaluation of any application made by the bank for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
a bank s cra rating may be used as the basis to deny or condition an application 
in addition  as discussed above  a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks has a cra rating of at least satisfactory 
southside bank was last examined for compliance with the cra on march  and received a rating of outstanding 
branch banking 
pursuant to the texas finance code  all banks located in texas are authorized to branch statewide 
accordingly  a bank located anywhere in texas has the ability  subject to regulatory approval  to establish branch facilities near any of our facilities and within our market area 
if other banks were to establish branch facilities near our facilities  it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching  subject to certain age and deposit concentration limits that may be imposed under applicable state laws 
texas law permits interstate branching in two manners  with certain exceptions 
first  a bank with its main office outside of texas may establish a branch in the state of texas by merging with a bank located in texas that is at least five years old  so long as the resulting institution and its affiliates would not hold more than of the total deposits in the state after the acquisition 
in addition  a bank with its main office outside of texas generally may establish a branch in the state of texas on a de novo basis if the bank s main office is located in a state that would permit texas banks to establish a branch on a de novo basis in that state 
the fdic has adopted regulations under the reigle neal act to prohibit an out of state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production 
these regulations include guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out of state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the out of state bank 
consumer protection regulation 
the activities of southside bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers 
interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates 
loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act and regulation z issued by the federal reserve  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  the home mortgage disclosure act and regulation c issued by the federal reserve  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b issued by the federal reserve  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit  the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the federal reserve  governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies  the fair debt collection act  governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies  and the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws 
deposit operations also are subject to the truth in savings act and regulation dd issued by the federal reserve  governing disclosure of deposit account terms to consumers  the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e issued by the federal reserve  which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
in addition  southside bank also may be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers 
commercial real estate lending 
lending operations that involve concentration of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators 
the regulators have issued guidance with respect to the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations 
real estate loans generally include land development  construction loans  loans secured by multi family property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property 
the guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent percent or more of the institutions total capital  or total commercial real estate loans represent percent or more of the institution s total capital and the outstanding balance of the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by percent or more during the prior months 
in october  the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 
anti money laundering 
southside bank is subject to the regulations of the financial crimes enforcement network fincen  which implement the bank secrecy act  as amended by the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government the power to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
title iii of the usa patriot act includes measures intended to encourage information sharing among banks  regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including state chartered banks like southside bank 
the usa patriot act and the related fincen regulations impose certain requirements with respect to financial institutions  including the following establishment of anti money laundering programs  including adoption of written procedures and an ongoing employee training program  designation of a compliance officer and auditing of the program  establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining information from customers seeking to open new accounts  including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time  establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering  and for financial institutions that administer  maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks  filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations  and requirements that bank regulators consider bank holding company or bank compliance in connection with merger or acquisition transactions 
bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 
the federal bureau of investigation can send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
southside bank can be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and required to report any identified relationships or transactions 
ofac 
the office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for helping to insure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac has sent  and will continue to send  bank regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts  known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
if we find a name on any transaction  account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  we must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 
privacy and data security 
under federal law  financial institutions are generally prohibited from disclosing consumer information to non affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure 
financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually 
to the extent state laws are more protective of consumer privacy  financial institutions must comply with state law privacy provisions 
in addition  federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information 
southside bank is subject to such standards  as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
under federal law  southside bank must disclose its privacy policy for collecting and protecting confidential customer information to consumers  permit consumers to opt out of having non public customer information disclosed to non affiliated third parties  with some exceptions  and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary 
states may adopt more extensive privacy protections 
southside bank is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal 
customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused 
regulatory examination 
see holding company regulation 
enforcement authority 
southside bank and its institution affiliated parties  including management  employees  agents  independent contractors and consultants  such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution s affairs  are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law  regulations or written orders of a government agency 
violations can include failure to timely file required reports  filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports 
civil penalties may be as high as  a day for such violations  and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for years 
regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution affiliated parties  and the fdic has the authority to terminate deposit insurance 
when issued by a banking agency  cease and desist orders may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets  rescind agreements or contracts  or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency 
the federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution or bar them from the industry if a violation is willful or reckless 
governmental monetary policies 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  control of borrowings  open market operations  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks  deposits and assets of foreign branches  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
these monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans  investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits 
recently  in response to the financial crisis  the federal reserve has established several innovative programs to stabilize certain financial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on southside bank s future business and earnings  therefore  cannot be predicted accurately 
capital purchase program 
under title i of the emergency economic stabilization act eesa enacted in october  as amended by the america recovery and reinvestment act arra in february  the us treasury department treasury established the troubled asset relief program tarp  which includes the capital purchase program cpp 
under the cpp  the treasury  upon application by a bank holding company and approval by the federal reserve board and the primary federal regulator of the subsidiary bank or banks  purchased senior preferred stock from the company 
because of our sound financial condition and the conditions that are or may be imposed on use of the cpp funds or on the institutions that received cpp funds  we chose not to apply for such funds 
evolving legislation and regulatory action 
proposals for new statutes and regulations are frequently circulated  and may include wide ranging changes to the structures  regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions 
in december  the house of representatives approved legislation that would make wide ranging changes to the framework and substance of federal bank regulation  and the us senate is now considering comparable regulation 
if approved  the proposed legislation could substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies 
such legislation may change existing bank statutes and regulations  as well as our current operating environment significantly 
specifically  the federal reserve s regulation of bank holding companies may increase and a new consumer protection agency may be created that would oversee the retail business of banks 
we cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any regulations  would have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we are subject to an economic environment that continues to pose significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
we retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and we could be affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including unemployment and new job losses  could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the effects of the national economic recession and any residual deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences increase in loan delinquencies  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures  decreases in demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our liquidity position  decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans  especially real estate  which could reduce customers borrowing power  decrease in the credit quality of our non us government and non us agency investment securities  especially our trust preferred  corporate and municipal securities  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  an adverse or unfavorable resolution of the fannie mae or freddie mac receivership could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation  and decrease in the real estate values subject to ad valorem taxes by municipalities that impact the municipalities ability to repay its debt  could adversely affect our municipal loans or debt securities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to face market volatility  which could adversely impact our results of operations and access to capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than two years 
while volatility in  and disruption of  these markets no longer remain at unprecedented levels  in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity without regard to an issuer s underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our results of operations and financial condition  including our liquidity position 
emergency measures designed to stabilize the us financial system are beginning to wind down 
since  various legislative and regulatory actions have been implemented in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and to the recession 
many of these programs are beginning to expire 
the wind down of these programs may have a direct adverse effect on us or a broader adverse impact on the financial sector 
tarp was established pursuant to eesa  as amended by arra  whereby the treasury has the authority to  among other things  spend up to billion to purchase equity in financial institutions  purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
though tarp was scheduled to expire on december   treasury announced that it will extend tarp until october   in order to retain an adequate financial stability reserve if financial conditions worsen and threaten the economy 
treasury has stated that any new tarp commitments in will be limited to the purposes of foreclosure mitigation  stabilizing the housing market  and providing capital to small and community banks as a source of credit for businesses 
on october   the fdic voted to end the debt guarantee program portion of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  which guarantees certain newly issued unsecured debt of banks and certain holding companies 
the debt guarantee program expired on october   with the guarantee period on such debt expiring on december  the transaction account guarantee portion of the program  which guarantees non interest bearing bank transaction accounts on an unlimited basis  is scheduled to continue until june  the federal reserve will begin to sell off its portfolio of mortgage backed securities  which it previously purchased in order to stabilize the residential mortgage market 
we cannot predict the effect that the wind down of these various governmental programs will have on current financial market conditions  or on our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit and the trading price of our common stock 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  changes in interest rates  changes in the yield curve  changes in market risk spreads  or a prolonged inverted yield curve could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  our ability to retain deposits in a rising rate environment  net interest rate spreads and net interest rate margins  our ability to enter into instruments to hedge against interest rate risk  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned net interest income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our management of interest rate risk 
we are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses 
we are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers  guarantors and related parties to pay interest and principal amounts on their loans 
although we maintain credit policies and credit underwriting and monitoring and collection procedures  these policies and procedures may not prevent losses  particularly during periods in which the local  regional or national economy suffers a general decline 
if borrowers fail to repay their loans  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our interest rate risk  liquidity  market value of securities and profitability are subject to risks associated with the successful implementation of our balance sheet and leverage strategy 
we implemented a balance sheet and leverage strategy in for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital 
the effectiveness of our balance sheet and leverage strategy  and therefore our profitability  may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including reduced net interest margin and spread  adverse market value changes to the investment and agency mortgage backed and related securities  adverse changes in the market liquidity of our agency mortgage backed and related securities  incorrect modeling results due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain wholesale funding to profitably and properly fund the leverage program 
if our balance sheet and leverage strategy is flawed or poorly implemented  we may incur significant losses 
see the section captioned balance sheet and leverage strategy in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a further decline in the real estate market  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
in addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case  often loans are secured with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of our loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the real estate in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing throughout and  there were well publicized developments in the credit markets  beginning with a decline in the sub prime mortgage lending market  which later extended to the markets for collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed securities and the lending markets generally 
this decline has continued to result in restrictions in the resale markets for non conforming loans and has had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets 
a further decline in the credit markets generally could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to extend credit or sell loans in the secondary market 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that  in a declining real estate market  we would be required to further increase our allowance for loan losses 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses  our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
we have a high concentration of loans directly related to the medical community in our market area  primarily in smith and gregg counties 
a negative change adversely impacting the medical community  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on the medical community 
the primary source of repayment for loans in the medical community is cash flow from continuing operations 
however  changes in the amount the government pays the medical community through the various government health insurance programs could adversely impact the medical community  which in turn could result in higher default rates by borrowers in the medical industry 
healthcare reform or increased regulation of the medical community could also negatively impact profitability and cash flow in the medical community 
it is likely that  should there be any significant adverse impact to the medical community  our profitability and financial condition would also be adversely impacted 
our allowance for probable loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for probable loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense 
this allowance represents management s best estimate of probable losses that may exist within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting the value of properties used as collateral for loans  problems affecting the credit of borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside our control  may require an increase in the allowance for probable loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for probable loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for probable loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for probable loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned loan loss experience and allowance for loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the texas areas of tyler  longview  lindale  whitehouse  chandler  gresham  athens  palestine  jacksonville  hawkins  bullard  forney  seven points  gun barrel city  fort worth  austin and arlington 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services  as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks have entered or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes  continued consolidation and recent trends in the credit and mortgage lending markets 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject or may become subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
southside bancshares  inc  primarily through southside bank  and certain nonbank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices and dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit deposit fees and other types of fees we charge  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
additionally  proposed legislation affecting the regulation of banking institutions may be enacted in  but the specific terms of such legislation are difficult to foresee 
while we cannot predict the regulatory changes that may arise out of the current financial and economic environment  any regulatory changes or increased regulatory scrutiny could increase costs directly related to complying with new regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while our policies and procedures are designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business and note shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we may become subject to increased regulatory capital changes 
in september  the treasury recommended  among other things  that regulatory capital requirements for all banks be increased 
the federal bank regulators and congress have discussed changes in the capital rules as well 
although it is uncertain whether any changes will be made  any such changes likely would result in higher capital requirements which would affect our asset portfolios and financial performance 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  we may implement new delivery systems  such as internet banking  or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
in developing and marketing new delivery systems and or new products and services  we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
southside bancshares  inc is a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that southside bank  and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to southside bancshares  inc also  southside bancshares  inc 
s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event southside bank is unable to pay dividends to southside bancshares  inc  southside bancshares  inc 
may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from southside bank could have a material adverse effect on southside bancshares  inc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business and note shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we may not be able to access capital on favorable terms  including cost of funds 
the availability and cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions  increased interest rates and competitive pressures and we may be unable to obtain funds on terms that are favorable to us 
we chose not to participate in the cpp  which was effectively closed in december  and in the future if we need to obtain additional funds  we may not be able to obtain them on terms as favorable to us as they may have been had we participated in the cpp 
if we are unable to obtain funds  we could be restricted in our ability to extend credit  and may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to support growth through branching or acquisition initiatives 
the holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders 
on september   we issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary  southside statutory trust iii 
these junior subordinated debentures mature in september on august and   we issued million and million  respectively  of five year fixed rate converting to floating rate thereafter  junior subordinated debentures in connection with million and million  respectively  trust preferred securities issuances by our subsidiaries southside statutory trust iv and v  respectively 
trust iv matures october and trust v matures september as part of the acquisition of fwbs on october   we assumed million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued to magnolia trust company i in connection with million of trust preferred securities issued in that matures in we conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
our junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock 
acquisitions and potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
during  we completed the acquisition of fwbs 
this was our first acquisition 
aside from this acquisition  we occasionally investigate potential merger or acquisition partners that appear to be culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either significant or attractive market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
we occasionally evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits and synergies from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities we engage in can be intense  and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  relationships in the communities we serve  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  there is no guarantee that these officers will remain employed with the company 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures  interruptions or security breaches or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and even if we implement such products and services  we may incur substantial costs in doing so 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  defending claims is costly and diverts management s attention  and if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect our market perception and products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  because of our location and the location of the market areas we serve  severe weather is more likely than in other areas of the country 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures  and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
funding to provide liquidity may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
the liquidity of southside bank is used to make loans and leases to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors 
management and our investment committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of southside bank and the company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
management and our investment committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify southside bank s funding sources to avoid concentrations in excess of board approved policies in any one market source 
funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core deposits  and short and long term debt 
southside bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank system  which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed 
these sources include sales or securitizations of loans  our ability to acquire additional national market  non core deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as federal home loan bank advances  the issuance and sale of debt securities  and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
southside bank also can borrow from the federal reserve s discount window 
we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity  but given the volatility in the credit and liquidity markets  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
for example  the cost of out of market deposits may exceed the cost of deposits of similar maturity in our local market area  making them unattractive sources of funding  financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally  there may not be a market for the issuance of additional trust preferred securities  and  given recent downturns in the economy  there may not be a viable market for raising equity capital 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might be unable to meet customers needs  which could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity  and level of regulatory qualifying capital 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and or our competitors  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 
the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market  the trading volume is low  and you are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include  among others  requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings and staggered board elections 
any individual  acting alone or with other individuals  who are seeking to acquire  directly or indirectly  or more of our outstanding common stock must comply with the change in bank control act  which requires prior notice to the federal reserve for any acquisition 
additionally  any entity that wants to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock  or otherwise control us  may need to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve under the bhca of  as amended 
as a result  prospective investors in our common stock need to be aware of and comply with those requirements  to the extent applicable 
we may issue additional securities  which could dilute your ownership percentage 
in certain situations  our board of directors has the authority  without any vote of our shareholders  to issue shares of our authorized but unissued stock 
in the future  we may issue additional securities  through public or private offerings  to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions 
any such issuance would dilute the ownership of current holders of our common stock 
risks associated with the banking industry the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings
