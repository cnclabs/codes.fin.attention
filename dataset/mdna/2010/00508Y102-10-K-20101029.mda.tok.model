outlook the performance of the company  like most companies  is influenced by a multitude of factors or the vitality of the economy  including employment  credit availability and cost  consumer confidence  commodity costs  and government policy  particularly as it impacts capital formation and risk taking by businesses and commercial developers 
as such  it is difficult at this time to precisely forecast the direction or intensity of future economic activity in general and more specifically with respect to overall construction demand in fiscal key indicators suggest activity to be slightly down to flat for the north american non residential construction market during fiscal however  the potential for energy savings and sustainability may buoy the demand for lighting fixtures and controls in relation to the renovation of commercial and institutional building and outdoor lighting markets 
additionally  there is an industry wide shortage of certain types of electronic ballasts and drivers due to a global shortage of certain common electronic components  and this has resulted in extended lead times and limited availability for some ballasts and drivers 
this continues to be a concern of management 
this situation is expected to persist for the near future and may adversely impact shipments 
the company has taken steps to procure and maintain sufficient materials and components stocks in the near term 
while prices for certain materials and components  including steel and petroleum  declined from their record highs in the summer and fall of  prices for certain materials and components have once again begun to rise  placing pressure on the company s margins 
the company expects to respond to cost increases with higher selling prices where appropriate  including  but not limited to  the announced price increases on many products effective at the end of may however  due to the competitive forces in the current market environment  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass along all cost increases or adjust prices quickly enough to offset all or a portion of potentially higher material and component prices 
notwithstanding efforts to recoup potentially higher costs  management believes pricing will continue to be competitive in certain channels and geographies but expects the negative impact to be offset through productivity improvements and benefits from new product introductions 
the company realized approximately of annualized benefits from the streamlining actions taken in fiscal  of which approximately of benefits were realized during fiscal and an additional during fiscal also  the company anticipates additional annualized savings beginning in fiscal of approximately due to the streamlining efforts announced during the second quarter of fiscal the company projects realized savings at the annualized rate by the second quarter of fiscal these actions related 
table of contents to the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and a reduction in workforce 
the company initiated such actions in an effort to continue to redeploy and invest resources in other areas where the company believes it can create greater value and accelerate profitable growth opportunities  including a continued focus on customer connectivity and industry leading product innovation incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable design 
in addition to the recent acquisitions  which significantly increased the company s presence in the growing lighting controls market  management believes the execution of the company s strategies to accelerate investments in innovative and energy efficient products and services  enhance service to its customers  and expand market presence in key geographies and sectors such as home centers and the renovation market will provide growth opportunities  which should enable the company to continue to outperform the overall markets it serves 
the company believes it is strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities within the market  as complete lighting systems will likely become an integral part of the smart building energy management development 
additionally  management believes these actions and investments will position the company to meet or exceed its financial goals over the longer term 
the company expects cash flow from operations to remain strong for fiscal and intends to invest up to in capital expenditures during the year 
in addition  the company expects to contribute approximately and to its domestic and international defined benefit plans  respectively  during fiscal the company estimates the annual tax rate to approximate for fiscal although fiscal results are expected to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions  management remains positive about the long term potential of the company and its ability to outperform the market 
although management anticipates short term performance will likely continue to be negatively affected by further investments in the growing controls and renovation markets  the company believes that these are necessary measures to further the company s long term profitable growth opportunities 
looking beyond the current environment  management believes the lighting and lighting related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade  particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront  and that the company is well positioned to fully participate in the industry

the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu  which amends the codification for the issuance of sfas see discussion on sfas above as adoption was concurrent with that standard 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
the updates to the codification require new disclosures around transfers into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to level measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the rollforward of level activity 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted the provisions of asu effective march  the company determined that the update had no impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows upon adoption 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements asu 
the amendments in this standard update define a sec filer within the codification and eliminate the requirement for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in order to remove potential conflicts with current sec guidance 
the relevant provisions of asu were effective upon the date of issuance of february   and the company adopted the amendments accordingly 
as the update only pertained to disclosures  asu had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued revisions to asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc  that required additional disclosures around the fair value measurements of plan assets within an entity s defined benefit and other post retirement plans 
the revised guidance require disclosures around plan assets related to investment allocation decisions  major categories of plan assets  inputs and valuation techniques  effect of changes in value of level assets  and concentrations of risk

in june  fasb issued guidance within asc topic  earnings per share asc  to clarify that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities 
the standard provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute earnings per share eps using the two class method 
the provisions of this standard were effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and were therefore adopted by the company on september  the eps amounts for previously reported periods have been adjusted due to retrospective adoption of this standard 
the company s diluted eps from continuing operations for the years ended august  and  under this guidance are and  respectively  as compared to and previously reported for these periods 
in december  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  business combinations asc  which changes the accounting for business combinations through a requirement to recognize of the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity 
other requirements include capitalization of acquired in process research and development assets  expensing  as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs and capitalizing restructuring charges as part of the acquisition only if requirements of asc topic  exit or disposal obligations  are met 
the standard was effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and was therefore adopted by the company on september  see the acquisitions footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of business combinations under this guidance on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  consolidation asc  that establishes the economic entity concept of consolidated financial statements  stating that holders of a residual economic interest in an entity have an equity interest in the entity  even if the residual interest is related to only a portion of the entity 
therefore  this standard requires a noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity 
the standard also states that once control is obtained  a change in control that does not result in a loss of control should be accounted for as an equity transaction 
the statement requires that a change resulting in a loss of control and deconsolidation is a significant event triggering gain or loss recognition and the establishment of a new fair value basis in any remaining ownership interests 
the standard was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and was therefore adopted by the company on september  the implementation of this guidance had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  as the company does not currently consolidate an entity with a noncontrolling interest 
accounting standards yet to be adopted in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu changes the accounting model for revenue 
table of contents arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements to allow for alternatives when vendor specific objective evidence does not exist 
under this guidance  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality and hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are excluded from the software revenue guidance in subtopic  software revenue recognition  thus  these arrangements are excluded from this update 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
asu is therefore effective for the company no later than the beginning of fiscal the company is currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adoption of the provisions of asu in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  of the codification for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
a selling price hierarchy is established for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c company specific estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
additional disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements are also required by this update 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
asu is therefore effective for the company no later than the beginning of fiscal the company is currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adoption of the provisions of asu critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed in the description of business and basis of presentation footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the long lived asset is below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with us gaap including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow and or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flows from operations 
goodwill the company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of in determining the fair value of the company s reporting unit  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires significant assumptions about discount rates as well as short and long term growth or decline rates  in accordance with us gaap 
the company utilized an estimated discount rate of as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
short term growth or decline rates are based on management s forecasted financial results  which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  growth or decline in non residential and residential construction markets  and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates 
the company calculates the discounted cash flows using a year period with a terminal value and compares this calculation to the discounted cash flows generated over a year period to ensure reasonableness 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under the step one goodwill impairment analysis 
indefinite lived intangible assets the company s indefinite lived intangible assets consist of five unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately management utilizes significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows in accordance with us gaap 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
future net sales and short term growth or decline rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management s forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  expected growth or decline in non residential and residential construction 
table of contents markets  and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market 
the theoretical royalty rate is estimated using a factor of operating profit margins and management s assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
with the exception of the lc d trade names  the company utilized a range of estimated discount rates between and as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of its five unamortized trade names 
the company s expected revenues are based on the company s fiscal plan and recent lighting market growth or decline estimates for fiscal through the company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the company improve performance 
during fiscal  estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between and 
the indefinite lived intangible asset analysis did not result in an impairment charge  as the fair values exceeded the carrying values for each trade name by a significant amount  except for the mark lighting and lc d trade names  which had fair values that exceeded each of its carrying values of and  respectively  by approximately and  respectively 
the estimated fair values of the indefinite lived intangible assets  other than the mark lighting and lc d trade names  exceed the carrying values by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying values to exceed the estimated fair values as determined by the fair value analyses 
the company determined that any estimated potential impairment related to the mark lighting or lc d trade names based on reasonable changes in the assumptions that would be less likely to occur would not be material to the company s financial results  trend of earnings  or financial position 
self insurance the company self insures  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to per occurrence of such claims 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on the company s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
the company is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting two days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
the company is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates calculated are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although the company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans with individual claims limited to the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow 

table of contents income taxes the company uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  income tax expense  and deferred income tax liabilities and assets  which represent temporary and permanent differences between amounts within the financial statements and the income tax basis 
asc  income taxes asc  requires the evaluation and testing of the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the relevant factors  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
reasonable judgment and estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and  if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers a number of factors  including  but not limited to the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  and the length of time carryovers can be utilized 
in light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the company operates  the company s tax returns are subject to routine audit by the internal revenue service irs and other taxation authorities 
these audits at times produce uncertainty regarding particular tax positions taken in the year s of review 
the company records uncertain tax positions as prescribed by asc  which requires recognition at the time when it is more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld 
although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded  changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect the company s financial position  results from operations  and cash flows 
retirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and international defined benefit pension plans and domestic defined contribution plans and other postretirement plans 
assumptions are used to determine the estimated fair value of plan assets  the actuarial value of plan liabilities  and the current and projected costs for these employee benefit plans and include  among other factors  estimated discount rates  expected returns on the pension fund assets  estimated mortality rates  and the rates of increase in employee compensation levels 
these assumptions are determined based on company and market data and are evaluated annually as of the plans measurement date 
see the pensions and profit sharing plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s plans 
share based compensation expense the company recognizes compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued 
the company accounts for stock options  restricted shares  and share units representing certain deferrals into the director deferred compensation plan or the supplemental deferred savings plan both of which are discussed further in the share based payments footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated under the previous guidance  and b share based expense for all awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated under the current provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the company recorded   and of share based expense in continuing operations for the years ended august    and  respectively 
the company employs the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of share based awards and records estimates of forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant  which are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
therefore  the expense related to share based payments recognized in fiscal   and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
as of august   there was of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of august   there was of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods  estimated compensation expense may differ significantly from that 
table of contents recorded in the current period 
see the summary of significant accounting policies and share based payments footnotes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options 
product warranty and recall costs the company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation the company recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for most environmental matters

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of the company to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
at august   the variable rate debt of the company was solely comprised of the long term industrial revenue bond 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the company s fixed rate debt which includes the publicly traded fixed rate notes 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the estimated fair value of these debt obligations by approximately see the debt and lines of credit footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of the company are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a significant portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical decline in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately in addition to products and services sold in mexico  a significant portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets 
commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of raw materials and components in its production process including petroleum based products  steel  and aluminum 
in fiscal  the company purchased approximately  tons of steel and aluminum 
the company estimates that less than of the raw materials purchased are petroleum based and that approximately million gallons of diesel fuel was consumed in fiscal failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could adversely affect the ability to maintain or increase operating margins
