in addition to operating income  other significant factors affecting our liquidity management include working capital levels  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions  availability of debt financing and the ability to attract long term capital at acceptable terms 
recent distress and volatility in financial markets has created increased levels of uncertainty regarding available debt and equity capital

these interest rates also vary as libor varies 
the agreement permits the company to issue and sell additional note series  subject to certain terms and conditions described in the agreement  up to a total of million in combined notes 
the company s million revolving credit facility  the facility permits the company to borrow at interest rates at january  based upon a margin above libor  which margin varies with the ratio of senior funded debt total debt excluding convertible debt to ebitda  as defined in the facility

we pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of the facility  which also varies with the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda 
on june   the company entered into a term loan agreement term loan with certain financial institutions  whereby the company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million 
the term loan matures in june  and borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to i a margin over the libor  which margin varies depending on whether certain criteria are satisfied  or ii the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement 
at january   the interest rate of was based on a margin over libor 
the notes  the term loan and the facility require us to meet specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of january  the company has interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company also had million and million of convertible senior subordinated notes outstanding at january  and december  respectively 
as of january  the notes are convertible as the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded the contingent conversion price for the specified amount of time 
the notes  which are unsecured and due in  bear interest at a fixed rate of for five years  and may increase thereafter at 
of the average trading price of a note if certain conditions are met 
the company must pay cash for the par value  but retained the option to either pay cash  issue its stock or a combination thereof  for value above par 
during the year ended january   a total of million face value of bonds was converted by the holders 
the company paid cash to redeem the par value of the debt and paid the conversion premium through issuance of approximately million shares

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of its short term and long term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions 
at january   net of interest rate swaps  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
the variable rate debt is primarily under our term loan with an interest rate based on a margin above libor 
as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at january  would result in a change in net income of approximately million 
predominately  all of our expenses are paid in cash  often with payment term provisions that include early payment discounts and time elements 
we believe that our ability to generate positive cash flow  coupled with our available revolver balance will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
we continue to act to reduce our investment in working capital through improved and enforced payment terms and operational efficiencies 
additionally  we believe that our capital expenditures for maintenance of equipment and facilities will be consistent with prior levels and not present a funding challenge 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at the end of we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future as we believe that we will continue to reduce outstanding debt balances during fiscal year and maintain an appropriate level of ebitda 
however  our ebitda performance is dependent on our financial performance in these uncertain and challenging market conditions which developed in and have continued through the primary financial covenants on our senior notes  term loan  and the facility include ratios of debt to ebitda as defined in each agreement and minimum interest coverage ratios of ebitda to interest expense 
the debt to ebitda covenant ratio requires us to be less than  and our ratio at january  was approximately the minimum interest coverage ratio requires us to be greater than  and our ratio at january  was approximately we will  from time to time  maintain positive cash balances which may be used to fund operations  repay outstanding debt and will be available for other investments which may include acquisitions of businesses or product lines  dividends  investments in new product development programs and the repurchase of our commons shares

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results 
impairment of long lived assets or goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
when applying the accounting guidance we use estimates to determine when an impairment is necessary 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform our required annual impairment test as of the end of the october fiscal month each year 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates  growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 
discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and long term growth rates 
the calculated fair values for our impairment testing exceed the carrying values of the reporting units 
as a result of our annual impairment review  we recorded a million impairment for our mechanical reporting unit  primarily related to auto and marine products that are dependent on consumer discretionary spending that have not met their performance plans 
derivatives the company periodically enters into commodity hedging transactions to reduce the impact of changing prices for certain commodities such as copper and aluminum based upon forecasted purchases of such commodities 
the company also uses a cash hedging strategy to protect against an increase in the cost of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
finally  we also have certain libor based floating rate borrowings that expose the company to variability in interest rates that have been swapped into a pay fixed receive libor based interest rate swap agreement 
the fair value of derivatives is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the value is determined based on level inputs 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements
