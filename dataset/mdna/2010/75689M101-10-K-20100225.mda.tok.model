item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of december   and february   we owned and operated or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which were company owned and were operated under franchise 
for the fiscal year  we plan to open between and new company owned red robin restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open between four to five new restaurants 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the challenging macroeconomic environment continued during fiscal year lack of consumer confidence and rising unemployment have continued to put pressure on guests discretionary income and have resulted in declining restaurant revenue across the industry 
in recent years  the restaurant industry has experienced increases in several key components of restaurant operating costs  including food  labor  and supply costs 
accordingly  we have experienced an increase in our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue 
we further discuss the components of our operating costs and our expectations for future trends in the results of operations section below 
in fiscal year  we experienced an decline in guest counts and an decline in average weekly comparable restaurant sales volumes from the prior year 
in  we focused on cost reductions to mitigate decreased restaurant sales 
while we were successful in managing many of these costs  we were unable to completely offset the decline in our profitability from those cost reduction initiatives 
while we expect the uncertainties in the economy will continue to impact our profitability and the restaurant 
table of contents industry in general in  we believe the long term growth and profit opportunities remain strong for red robin 
the following summarizes the operational and financial highlights of fiscal year and the outlook comparable restaurant revenue 
for the fifty two weeks ended december   the restaurants in our current comparable base experienced a decrease in sales from these same restaurants last year 
this decrease was driven by a decrease in guest counts 
our restaurant revenues are significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  and fluctuations of our food costs 
many of our guests are impacted by the current macroeconomic pressures  and they have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
accordingly  we continuously strive to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand and to deliver memorable dining experiences that attract new guests and retain our already loyal guests 
historically  we have implemented price increases to offset increased costs 
in fiscal year  however  we did not implement any price increases and we expect that we will have limited ability to do so for the foreseeable future  given the current pressures on our guests discretionary income and the competitive landscape 
food costs 
the costs of many basic foods  including corn  wheat  soy beans  and oil increased in this has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our food costs categories including beef  dairy  steak fries and fry oil 
we mitigated the rising price increases for some of our commodities through favorable fixed pricing contracts in in  we believe our two largest cost pressures will be ground beef used in our hamburgers and potatoes that are used to make our steak fries 
in  we expect our ground beef prices to be based on current market prices with contract overages that are expected to run below prices 
in addition  we have entered into supply agreements for our steak fries  poultry  and other commodities at prices generally below prices 
labor 
labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal year by primarily due to deleverage of fixed management salaries  insurance  workers compensation expense  and minimum wage increases on lower average restaurant sales volume 
additionally  a non cash stock based compensation charge of  related to the option tender offer increased labor costs 
offsetting these increases were decreases in vacation expense and restaurant level manager bonuses 
national media advertising campaign 
in  we reduced the spending on our national media advertising campaign and focused our marketing strategy on driving guest traffic and retention by expanding our national online and digital media advertising efforts as well as introducing a targeted direct mail campaign to support product specific news 
during the fall of fiscal year  we introduced limited time offers  or ltos  in test markets on two promotional products offered at a value price point utilizing local market television and radio advertising 
given the effectiveness of the fall lto television media in the test markets  during the spring of fiscal year we plan to offer a lto promotion at a value price point supported by national and some local television advertising 
while our fall lto promotions paired with television and radio advertising were successful in increasing guest counts  we cannot project with confidence the impact that these lto products and enhanced television advertising will have on our restaurant sales 
marketing expense reclassification 
as our marketing strategies have evolved from specific local restaurant marketing tactics into strategies focused on building brand awareness and driving guest traffic and retention at a national level  we have determined that marketing related expenses are best reflected in the selling  general and administrative expense category of our 
table of contents income statement 
beginning with the launch of our first media advertising campaigns in  the coordination and management of marketing strategies which have historically been made at the discretion of our restaurant general managers are now being developed and implemented at the direction of our centralized marketing organization 
therefore  we have reclassified marketing related expenses from restaurant operating expenses to the selling  general and administrative expense category 
we have reclassified all periods presented in our income statement for purposes of comparability 
marketing expenses reclassified to selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for the periods ended december   december   and december   respectively 
new restaurant openings 
we opened new company owned restaurants during fiscal year while our new restaurants have been impacted by the general decline in guest visits experienced in our restaurants  our initiatives to reduce costs  both pre and post opening  and to normalize operations faster have been successful 
in the near term  we are taking a balanced approach to our development as we seek to deploy our capital conservatively while maintaining restaurant growth 
we plan on opening to new company owned restaurants in we believe we will fund all restaurant development expenses from our operating cash flow 
option tender offer 
during the first quarter  we completed a cash tender offer for out of the money stock options 
we incurred a one time charge of pre tax million for all unvested eligible options that were tendered 
we paid million in cash for the approximate million options tendered in the offer

restaurant revenue  which is comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  decreased by million  or  from fiscal year the significant factors contributing to our decrease in restaurant revenue was reduced guest counts in our comparable restaurants  offset by revenue growth from our new restaurant openings 
restaurants in the comparable sales base experienced a revenue decline of million from the prior year 
restaurant revenues for restaurants not in the comparable sales base increased million  of which million was attributable to restaurants opened during fiscal year the revenue growth in over was attributable to revenue from restaurant openings and acquisitions

the decrease in average comparable restaurant weekly sales in fiscal year was primarily the result of decreased guest counts 
franchise royalties and fees  which consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees  decreased million or  from the year over year decrease in franchise royalties and fees is primarily attributable to the overall decrease in reported franchise sales 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales decreased for us restaurants and decreased for canadian restaurants in the year ended december  franchise royalties and fees for decreased over

asset impairment charge and restaurant closure costs we closed four restaurants in the first quarter of this decision was the result of an initiative to identify restaurants that are in declining trade areas  performing below acceptable profitability levels and or require significant capital expenditures 
the locations closed represented older restaurants whose leases were not extended or were in need of significant capital improvements that were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
we recognized charges of  during related to lease terminations and other closing related costs 
in we recognized million of asset impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of a portion of long lived assets associated with the four restaurants closed in in addition to the impairment charges related to the restaurant closures  we recognized million of non cash impairment charges in for two restaurants that continue to operate 
there were no asset impairment charges recognized in reacquired franchise costs as a result of the acquisition of the restaurants during  we incurred a total charge of  which is primarily related to avoided franchise fees 
the guidance for accounting for business combinations requires that a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting relationship be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
the  charge reflects the lower royalty rates applicable to certain of the acquired restaurants compared to a standard royalty rate the company would receive under the company s current royalty agreements 
see note  acquisition of red robin franchised restaurants  in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition and related charge 

table of contents interest expense interest expense in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense in was lower than due to reduced outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and a lower weighted average interest rate of versus in interest expense in was lower than due to a lower weighted average interest rate of versus  partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings under our credit facility

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in  from million in our effective income tax rate was for  for  and for the decreases in versus and versus were primarily due to more favorable general business and tax credits  primarily the fica tip tax credit  as a percent of current year income  which did not change at the same rate as the decrease in taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december   from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to million of cash provided by operating activities  offset by million used for the construction of new restaurants and expenditures for facility improvements  million net pay down of debt  and million net of tax used to purchase the approximate million shares as part of the tender offer 
we expect to continue to reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  pay down debt  and leave the potential to opportunistically repurchase some of our common stock 
credit facility 
our existing credit facility has permitted us to have a more flexible capital structure and facilitate our growth plans 
the credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on june   and ii a million term loan maturing on june   both with rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that is currently 
the credit agreement also allows us  subject to lender participation which is at their sole discretion  to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional million in the future and to request maturity extensions 
as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock of subsidiaries of the company 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
our credit facility is with a consortium of banks that include wells fargo bank na formerly wachovia bank na  bank of america na  keybank na  and suntrust bank  national association suntrust among others 
we do not believe that any of our lenders will not be able to fulfill their lending commitments under our credit facility 
with regard to the term loan facility  we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments which began september  and will end on the maturity date of the term loan 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan  and million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
loan origination costs associated with the credit facility and the net outstanding balance of costs related to the original agreement and subsequent amendment to 
table of contents the credit facility are  and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  and dividend payments 
in addition  we are required to maintain two financial ratios a leverage ratio calculated as our debt outstanding including issued standby letters of credit divided by the last twelve months earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization adjusted for certain non cash charges  and a fixed charge ratio calculated as our consolidated cash flow divided by our consolidated debt service obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance through fiscal year debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to our scheduled debt repayments of million and additional repayments of million  as well as payments on our capital lease obligations of approximately million 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our credit agreement including interest of million based on a average borrowing interest rate

capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings  and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
excluded are any agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
while we have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot market prices relating to food costs  we do not have any material contracts either individually or in the aggregate in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases 
other non current liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant bonuses for long term incentive plans  uncertain tax positions  and vendor deposits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  includes lower expenditures for new restaurants as well as reductions in facility improvements 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with was primarily due to higher expenditures for new restaurant construction and facility improvements 

table of contents in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to million 
in addition to the construction of to new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements 
stock repurchase 
during  we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million with an average purchase price of per share 
also during  the company s board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to million of the company s equity securities of which repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions and through privately negotiated transactions through december  no shares have been repurchased under the plan through fiscal year option tender offer 
during the first quarter  we completed a cash tender offer for out of the money stock options held by then current employees 
as a result of the tender offer  we incurred a one time pre tax charge of million for all unvested eligible options that were tendered 
this one time charge represents the compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on the unvested options tendered in the offer  which would otherwise have been expensed over their vesting period in the future if they had not been tendered 
approximately million of the million charge is recorded in labor expense and the remaining million is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income 
we paid million in cash for the approximate million options tendered in the offer 
financial condition and future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital to acquire franchise restaurants or repurchase our common stock 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit 
we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis 
rapid turnover results in limited investment in inventories  and cash from sales is usually received before related accounts payable for food  supplies and payroll become due 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in fiscal year  due primarily to increased labor costs  higher costs for certain supplies  and commodity prices for certain foods we purchased at market rates 
uncertainties related to fluctuations in costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and 
table of contents annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality 
accordingly  results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets  and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  including assumptions on future revenue trends 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
during  we recorded million of impairments of certain long lived restaurants for four restaurants we closed in the first quarter of and for two restaurants that have continued operations 
no additional impairment charges were recorded during  although we may record future impairments for restaurants whose operating performance falls below current expectations 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of long lived assets 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management s view of current market and economic conditions and with respect to conditions at specific locations 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we performed step one of the impairment test as of december  step one of the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill balances  to the fair value of our net assets 
fair value is measured using a combination of the market capitalization method  the income approach  and the market approach 
the market capitalization method uses the company s stock price and a control premium to derive fair value 
the income approach consists of utilizing the discounted cash flow method that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs  discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate 
our estimates used in the income approach are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage operations 
the market approach utilizes multiples of profit measures in order to estimate the fair value of the assets 
the market capitalization method and the income approach are more heavily weighted than the market approach in determining the fair value of the assets given they are more accurately measured and more closely align with how management internally evaluates and manages the business 
we do  however  evaluate all methods to ensure reasonably consistent results 
additionally  we evaluate the key input factors in the models used to determine whether a moderate change in any input factor or combination of factors would significantly change the results of the tests 
based on the completion of the step one test  we 
table of contents determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december   as the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value was approximately 
however  an impairment charge may be triggered in the future  if the value of our stock declines  sales in our restaurants decline beyond current forecast  or if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment of the restaurant industry 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of goodwill 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management s view of current market and economic conditions 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account for leases in the past three years 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account our self insurance liabilities in the past three years 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account for stock based compensation in the past three years 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities vie  which will be effective for fiscal year the new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our credit agreement  amended in june  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to

as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  after considering the impact of variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
a plus or minus change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuation of  on an annualized basis 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we use an interest rate swap and may use caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
during march  the company entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with suntrust to mitigate our floating interest rate on an aggregate of up to million of our debt that is currently or expected to be outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility 
the interest rate swap has an effective date of march  and a termination date of march  for million of the initial million and march  for the remaining million 
the agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge under which we are required to make payments based on a fixed interest rate of calculated on an initial notional amount of million  in exchange we will receive interest on a million of notional amount at a variable rate

many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price product purchase commitments which may exclude fuel surcharges and other fees 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
