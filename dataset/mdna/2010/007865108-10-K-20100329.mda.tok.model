the improvement in merchandise margin was due primarily to improved merchandise sell through and less markdowns 

table of contents gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to higher transportation costs and depreciation  which offset higher merchandise margin of percentage points 
merchandise margin decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily due to increased promotional activity

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  construction of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  and the improvement and enhancement of our information technology systems 
due to the seasonality of our business  we have historically realized a significant portion of our cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
most recently  our cash requirements have been met primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand during the first half of the year  and through cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
we expect to continue to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months primarily through cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility  if necessary 
at january   we had working capital of million  cash and c ash equivalents of million and no debt outstanding under our million credit facility

the primary components of the increase in cash flows from operations for fiscal included an increase in net income of million

investing activities we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the construction of new a ropostale stores  ps from a ropostale stores  to remodel existing stores and for certain other information technology investments 
our future capital requirements will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and other strategic investments 
in fiscal  we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures to open approximately a ropostale stores  approximately to ps from a ropostale stores and approximately store remodels  in addition to certain information technology investments 

table of contents we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the construction of new a ropostale stores  to remodel existing stores and for certain other information technology investments 
we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the construction of new a ropostale stores  to remodel seven existing stores  to complete the rollout of upgraded point of sale systems to our store chain  to open a second distribution center and for certain other information technology investments 
financing activities we repurchase our common stock from time to time under a stock repurchase program 
the repurchase program may be modified or terminated by the board of directors at any time  and there is no expiration date for the program 
the extent and timing of repurchases will depend upon general business and market conditions  stock prices  opening and closing of the stock trading window  and liquidity and capital resource requirements going forward 
on december   our board of directors approved a million increase in repurchase availability under the program  bringing total repurchase authorization  since inception of the program  to million 
we repurchased million shares for million during fiscal  as compared to repurchases of million shares for million during fiscal and million shares for million during fiscal program to date  we have returned million to shareholders in the form of million shares repurchased  at an average price of per share 
we have approximately million of repurchase authorization remaining as of january  under the million share repurchase program 
we have an amended and restated revolving credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million revolving credit line 
the credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature on november   and no amounts were outstanding during fiscal or as of january  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations real estate operating leases employment agreements equipment operating leases total contractual obligations the real estate operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which amounted to approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal in addition  the above table does not include variable costs paid to landlords such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have a supplemental executive retirement plan serp liability of million at january   a postretirement benefit plan liability of million at january   and a long term incentive deferred compensation plan liability of million at january  such liability amounts are not reflected in the table above 
as a result of mr 
geiger s election and another employee retirement  we expect to make payments in the next months of approximately million from our serp which amount is included in the total serp liability of million see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no financial guarantees and no commercial commitments outstanding as of january  
table of contents our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million at january   of which million is classified in accrued expenses 
we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments for these non current liabilities of million 
therefore these liabilities were not included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of january   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in applying such policies  management must use significant estimates that are based on its informed judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
changes in such estimates  based on more accurate future information  may affect amounts reported in future periods 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a difference in our estimate of inventory at the lower of cost or market as of january  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended january  income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes asc 
under asc  income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income tax es  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements and requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements see note to the notes to consolidated financial sta tements 

table of contents long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
management makes assumptions and applies judgment to estimate future cash flows 
these assumptions include factors such as both historical and forecasted results and trends 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge 
accordingly  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to our jimmy z store concept during fiscal additionally  we have recorded a ropostale store impairment charges of million for six stores in fi scal compared to million for stores in fiscal and million for five stores in fiscal  which were included in depreciation and amortization expense  which is a component of cost of sales see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp current liability of million and serp non current liability of million are appropriately stated as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a materi al impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if we had changed the expected discount rate by in fiscal  pension expense would have changed by less than  recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  we had no stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to the credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
unrealized foreign currency gains and losses  resulting from the translation of our canadian subsidiary s financial statements into our us dollar reporting currency are reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the balance of the unrealized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was approximately  as of january  a movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value translation fluctuation of approximately million  which would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as an unrealized gain or loss 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that our canadian subsidiary purchases using us dollars 
these foreign currency transaction gains and losses are charged or credited to earnings as incurred 
we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation  and transaction gains and losses to date have not been significant
