item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results ofoperations management s discussion and analysis is provided to assist in understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
overview citizens south banking corporation the company is a delaware corporation that owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of citizens south bank the bank  a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in gastonia  north carolina 
the company s principal business activities are overseeing and directing the business of the bank 
the company s assets consist primarily of the outstanding capital stock of the bank  deposits held at the bank  and investment securities 
the bank s principal business activity is offering fdic insured deposit accounts to local customers through its branch offices and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  in residential and nonresidential real estate loans  construction loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
the bank also acts as a broker in both the origination of loans secured by one to four family residences and in the sale of uninsured financial products see item business of this annual report for additional details regarding the business of the company 
our primary business strategy is to operate as a full service community bank  offering a complete array of both commercial and retail loan and deposits  mortgage banking activities  brokerage services  and other related financial services 
in executing this strategy  the company has concentrated much of its lending efforts on local residential and nonresidential real estate loans  business loans and consumer loans  originated a large portion of all fixed rate one to four family residential loans as a broker for a third party  and focused its deposit gathering efforts on local core deposits demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts 
in management expects to focus on originating owner occupied commercial real estate  residential mortgage  commercial business and consumer loans  rather than construction  residential acquisition and development  and commercial land loans 
the bank s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities 
the bank s results of operations are also heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
the provision for loan losses is affected by the company s actual loan losses  amount of delinquent loans  local economic conditions  and the collateral position of our loan portfolio 
noninterest income primarily includes fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  mortgage banking fees  commissions earned from the sale of uninsured investment products  increases in the cash value of bank owned life insurance policies  net gains losses from the sale of assets and other noninterest income 
the bank s noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  deposit insurance  amortization of intangible assets  impairment on investments and goodwill  and other noninterest expenses 
for the year ended december   the company reported a loss of million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses  which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increased provision reflected the continued weakness of the overall economy in the charlotte region and the associated increased level of delinquent loans  as well as net charge offs for the year of million  or of average loans 
at december   nonperforming assets  which includes loans that are days or more delinquent or in nonaccrual status and other real estate owned  amounted to million  or of total assets 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   reflecting the restructuring of million of fhlb advances  which resulted in a lower effective interest rate and extended duration 
total stockholders equity decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to a million loss in due to a million goodwill impairment 
the goodwill impairment did not affect the bank s regulatory capital ratios  at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was and its tangible capital ratio was  which meant the bank was considered well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and financial policies of the company and its subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
we consider accounting policies that require difficult or subjective judgment and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
based on the size of the item or significance of the estimate  the following accounting policies are considered critical to our financial results 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb estimated probable loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio at the measurement date 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires an estimate of the loss for each type of loan and for each impaired loan  an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  and an estimate of the value of the collateral 
management has established a systematic method for periodically evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish an allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is consistently applied  set forth in a formal policy and includes a review of all loans in the portfolio on which full collectability may or may not be reasonably assured 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company reviews all investment securities with significant declines in fair value for potential other than temporary impairment on a periodic basis 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
generally changes in market interest rates that result in a decline in value of an investment security are considered to be temporary  since the value of such investment can recover in the foreseeable future as market interest rates return to their original levels 
however  such declines in value that are due to the underlying credit quality of the issuer or other adverse conditions that cannot be expected to improve in the foreseeable future  may be considered to be other than temporary 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation of the underlying credit or analysis of other conditions contributing to the decline in value involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
comparison of financial condition for the years ended december  and the discussion below is designed to provide a comparison of the company s financial condition from december   to december  the company s financial condition is primarily measured in terms of its composition of assets and liabilities and capital adequacy and liquidity 
assets total assets decreased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the primary reason for the decrease was a million goodwill impairment charge that reduced the goodwill balance to this goodwill impairment charge resulted from the company s annual goodwill impairment test which determined that the company s goodwill was fully impaired 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents represents the company s interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts  fed funds  and cash on hand 
these assets increased by million from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the million increase in deposits and liquidity resulting from a million decrease in investment securities and a million decrease in total loans outstanding 
these increases were partly offset by a million decrease in borrowed money  million in cash dividends paid to common stockholders  million in cash dividends paid to preferred stockholders  and million that was prepaid to the fdic for three years of deposit insurance premiums 
management expects that cash and cash equivalents will decrease in as new loans are funded and excess liquidity is invested in investment securities 
loans 
during  loans outstanding decreased by million from million at december   to million at december  most of this decrease was concentrated in speculative construction loans which decreased by million  or  to million at december   and commercial land and residential acquisition and development loans which decreased by million  or  to million at december  given the continued slowdown in the local economy and real estate markets  the company has focused on reducing its exposure to these types of loans 
historically  the company has not actively originated commercial real estate loans that are secured by hotels  motels  golf courses  or resort properties 
also  the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation residential portfolio loans and the portfolio does not include any residential mortgage loans that are considered sub prime which are generally considered loans made to borrowers with lower credit ratings resulting from a poor payment history 
the company continues to solicit owner occupied commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans  business loans  and consumer loans to customers located in the company s primary lending area 
the company originates and closes a large portion of all new one to four family residential loans as a broker for independent third parties on a servicing released basis 
this generates additional fee income and reduces the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s future earnings that normally result from holding long term fixed rate loans 
in general  the company retains in its portfolio residential loans that have an adjustable interest rate or are jumbo loans that are not marketable in the secondary market 
these loans are fully underwritten and typically have a loan to value ratio of or less 
management expects that in the company s portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans will continue to increase from its current balance of million as a number of competitors have exited this business sector due to the housing slowdown 
in addition  mortgage loan interest rates have become more attractive for borrowers  thus increasing opportunities for customers to refinance their existing mortgage loans 
during  consumer loans increased by million to million at december  approximately million  or  of these consumer loans were home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second lien on residential properties 
these loans typically have a loan to value ratio of or less including any senior liens and are generally secured by owner occupied residential properties located in the company s primary lending area 
management plans to continue to grow its consumer loan portfolio in by continuing an incentive plan for its retail branch managers 
however  due to declining housing prices  management has lowered the loan to value ratio on new home equity lines of credit to 
commercial business loans increased by million  or  to million at december  management expects moderate growth of its commercial business loans in given the current economic conditions 
the following table represents the maturity distribution of the company s loans by type  including fixed rate loans  as of december  demand loans  loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as becoming due within one year 
loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned discounts  unearned income and allowance for loan losses 
one year one to over five or less five years years total dollars in thousands one to four family residential multifamily residential construction nonresidential real estate commercial business consumer total gross loans the following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans as of december   for which final payment is not due until after december  the table also shows the amount of each type of loan that has a fixed rate of interest and those that have an adjustable rate of interest 
fixed rates adjustable rates total dollars in thousands one to four family residential multifamily residential construction nonresidential real estate commercial business consumer total gross loans scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates 
investment securities 
the company s investment security portfolio primarily consists of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored entities  and municipal bonds 
investment securities decreased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of the sale of million in investment securities and million in normal maturities  principal amortization  and calls 
the sales of investment securities during were primarily for the purpose of reducing longer term maturities and subsequently lowering the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
this decrease in investment securities was partly offset by the purchase of million in investment securities in the securities purchased generally had shorter maturities or were designated as held to maturity in order to reduce the company s capital exposure to rising interest rates in the future 
management expects that in the balances of its investment securities portfolios will increase as management invests its excess liquidity in order to generate increased future earnings 
premises and equipment 
the company operates full service branches in the charlotte region 
the company owns of the offices  including the corporate office and operations center  and leases the four other offices 
during premises and equipment decreased by million  or  to million at december  normal depreciation during amounted to million which was the primary reason for the decrease 
in the company converted its loan production office in charlotte to a full service branch and renovated its operations center 
in  the company plans to move from its leased branch in stallings to a leased office in indian trail 
this move will give the company greater exposure in the union county market 
the company will continue to evaluate potential branch sites in its existing market area as opportunities arise 
intangible assets 
the company s intangible assets consist of  in core deposit intangibles that was booked in conjunction with the company s acquisition of trinity bank in this intangible asset is being amortized on an accelerated basis and will be fully amortized in amortization expense in amounted to  compared to  in in addition  as the result of the company s previous acquisitions  the company had booked million of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized over its useful life  but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
as of december   the company had performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that its goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in a million goodwill impairment charge against earnings 
liabilities total liabilities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in deposits 
this increase was partly offset by a million  or  decrease in borrowed money deposits 
the company offers a wide array of deposit products for small businesses and consumers including demand deposit accounts  money market deposit accounts  savings accounts  and time deposits 
during  the company s total deposits increased by million from million at december   to million at december  most of this growth was from demand deposit accounts  or checking accounts  which increased by million  or  to million at december  management is committed to increasing demand deposit accounts and building new and enhancing existing customer relationships through improving technology  expanding its branch network and focused marketing efforts 
the company continues to focus on two new products for both its commercial and retail customers that significantly contributed to the strong growth in demand deposit accounts in the first product is our remote deposit capture  which gives our commercial customers the ability to make deposits of checks remotely without physically visiting a branch office 
this allows our commercial sales force the opportunity to solicit business from commercial customers that may not be located near an existing branch office 
the second product is a high yield checking account product that compares favorably with some of our competitors who offer a higher interest rate on their checking account  but include numerous conditions in order to receive the higher rate 
in addition  we offer all day banking  which eliminated the pm cutoff for current day processing of deposits 
during  money market deposit accounts increased by million  or  to million at december  this growth was partly due to consumers moving money from other financial institutions and brokerage accounts due to concerns about the safety of their principal during the height of the financial crisis in early also  some consumers rolled their maturing time deposits into these accounts because they provide a higher degree of liquidity and provide a competitive interest rate 
the increases in these accounts was partly offset by a  decrease in savings accounts to million at december   and time deposits which decreased million  or  to million at december  these decreases were primarily due to the low level of short term interest rates in  which made alternative investments more attractive to customers 
while management is committed to growing its deposit base from within the company s market area  we are focused on building relationships and we generally do not offer premium interest rates on time deposits to customers that do not have a banking relationship with our company 
from time to time  brokered time deposits may be used as an additional source of liquidity as needed 
however  historically we have not needed to solicit such brokered relationships and as of december   only  was brokered time deposits 
the following table indicates the amount of our time deposits also referred to as certificates of deposits with a principal balance greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december maturity period dollars in thousands within three months over three to six months over six to twelve months over twelve months total time deposits over  the following table sets forth the amount of time deposits in the bank categorized by rates as of december at the dates indicated 
interest rate dollars in thousands less than to to to total the following table sets forth the amount of time deposits in the bank categorized by rates and maturities at december   for the respective years ended december interest rate or later total dollars in thousands less than to to over total borrowed money 
the company s borrowed money includes advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  repurchase agreements  retail repurchase agreements  and subordinated debt 
during our borrowed money decreased by million from million at december   to million at december  funds generated from the increase in deposits were primarily used to repay maturing fhlb advances during in addition  during the company restructured million in fhlb advances in order to lower the cost of borrowing and to increase the maturity 
in executing this restructuring of fhlb advances  the company paid a one time fee of  and a  prepayment penalty which will be amortized over the life of the restructured advances 
as a result  the company expects to recognize a decrease  net of the amortized prepayment penalty  of  in interest expense for from time to time  management may use borrowed money to engage in various leverage strategies to increase income as opportunities arise 
of the million in advances with the federal home loan bank  the following have scheduled maturities greater than one year maturity date interest rate call features principal no call no call no call callable no call no call no call no call no call callable no call no call capital resources stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity decreased by million from million at december   to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to a million loss recognized by the company in this loss was largely due to a million goodwill impairment that contributed to a million decrease in retained earnings from million at december   to million at december  since goodwill is an intangible asset  this impairment did not affect the company s tangible common equity ratio which amounted to at december   compared to at december  and it did not affect the bank s regulatory capital ratios 
also during  the company paid million in dividends to common stockholders from the company s retained earnings 
funding for future growth is dependent upon the earnings of the company and its subsidiaries 
at december   the company had a capital to assets ratio of 
as such  the company fully expects to be able to meet future capital needs caused by growth and expansion as well as regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory capital 
ots regulations require savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage ratio and an risk based capital ratio 
at december   citizens south bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
under prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  significantly undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 
at december   citizens south bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized 
preferred stock 
on december   citizens south banking corporation entered into a letter agreement the purchase agreement with the united states department of the treasury us treasury pursuant to which the company has issued and sold to the us treasury i  shares of the company s fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  par value per share the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  and ii a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price per share of 
the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per annum 
after three years  the company may  at its option  redeem the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
prior to december   and unless the company has redeemed all of the series a preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to a third party  the approval of the us treasury will be required for the company to increase its common stock dividend or repurchase its common stock or other equity or capital securities  other than in certain circumstances specified in the purchase agreement 
the warrant has a ten year term and is immediately exercisable 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the company s common stock  and upon certain issuances of the company s common stock at or below a specified price relative to the then current market price of the company s common stock 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the us treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
both the series a preferred stock and warrant will be accounted for as components of tier capital 
the series a preferred stock and the warrant were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act of  as amended 
the company has agreed to register for resale the series a preferred stock  the warrant and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant if and when requested to do so in writing by the us treasury 
neither the series a preferred stock nor the warrant will be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer 
the us treasury also placed certain restrictions on the amount and type of compensation that can be paid to certain senior level executives of the company 
liquidity management the objectives of the company s liquidity management policy include providing adequate funds to meet the cash needs of both borrowers and depositors  to provide for the on going operations of the company  and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the company s ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  increases in local deposits  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  it may rely upon external sources of funds such as brokered deposits and borrowings  including fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had approximately million in additional advances available from its line of credit from the fhlb 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and we are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets principally securities that are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the us government provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
in addition  the bank maintains a million unsecured fed funds line of credit with pacific coast bankers bank and a million unsecured fed funds line of credit with centerstate bank of florida 
as of december   the balance on both of the fed funds lines of credit was the company may also solicit brokered deposits for providing funds for asset growth 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  various commitments are outstanding that are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed advances on customer lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
the funding of these commitments and previously approved undisbursed lines of credit could affect the company s liquidity position 
at december   the company had loan commitments of million  million in undisbursed construction loan proceeds  and unused lines of credit of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments and lines of credit as they arise 
the company does not have any special purpose entities or other similar forms of off balance sheet financing 
contractual obligations 
under existing contractual obligations  the company will be required to make payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about payments due under such contractual obligations at december  the company expects that a portion of the deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense 
transaction deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities have been classified as having payments due in one year or less 
one year or less one to three years over three to five years over five years total dollars in thousands borrowed funds deposits lease obligations total asset quality non performing assets and delinquencies 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and collecting the payment 
computer generated late notices are mailed days after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency continues  additional contact is made either through a notice or other means and we will attempt to work out a payment schedule and actively encourage delinquent residential mortgage borrowers to seek home ownership counseling 
while we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  we will institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status if  in the opinion of management  principal and or interest payments are not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  such as when principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest accrued but not collected at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against income in the current period 
loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments have been made to bring the account under days past due or  in the opinion of management  collection of the remaining past due balances can be reasonably expected 
our board of directors is informed monthly of the total amount of loans which are more than days delinquent 
loans that are more than days delinquent or in foreclosure are reviewed by the board on an individual basis each month 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our non performing assets at december for the years indicated 
dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis one to four family residential multifamily residential construction nonresidential real estate commercial business consumer total nonaccrual loans accruing loans which were contractually past due days or more total non performing loans real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non performing assets to total loans and oreo other real estate owned 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned 
at december   we had million in other real estate owned compared to million at december  our current balance of other real estate owned is comprised of single family residences  residential lots  one parcel of commercial land  one parcel of residential land and two commercial buildings located in the bank s normal lending area 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
generally  foreclosed assets are held for sale and are carried on the books at the lower of cost or market value minus estimated cost to sell the property 
after the date the asset is considered owned by the bank  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed and costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized up to the extent of their net realizable value 
if the value of the property declines before it is ultimately disposed of  we recognize an additional write down through earnings to ensure the value of the property is properly recorded on the company s books 
in  we recognized valuation adjustments of  on other real estate owned 
restructured loans 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as troubled debt restructurings 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrowers that we would not otherwise consider 
debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower do not necessarily always constitute troubled debt restructurings 
also  troubled debt restructurings do not necessarily result in an increase in nonaccrual loans 
as of december   we had six restructured loans totaling million 
asset classification 
the ots has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
the regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  ots examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  we establish specific allowances for loan losses for the full amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss 
all or a portion of general loan loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful can be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital  while specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
as of december   we had million of assets classified as substandard   of assets classified as doubtful and no loans classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
management determined that there were impaired loans totaling million as of december  based on an analysis of the underlying collateral of the loans  the overall economic conditions  discussions with the borrowers  and the historical performance of the loan  management created specific reserves totaling million for these impaired loans 
as of december   we had million of assets classified as substandard  million of assets classified as doubtful and no loans classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
management determined that there were impaired loans totaling million as of december  based on an analysis of the underlying collateral of the loans  the overall economic conditions  discussions with the borrowers  and the historical performance of the loan  management created specific reserves totaling  for these impaired loans 
allowance for loan losses 
management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and considers all loans in the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million compared to million at december  management believes that the current allowance meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining loan portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination

management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

we offer these products to both retail and commercial customers 
deposit account terms vary with the principal difference being the minimum balance deposit  early withdrawal penalties and the interest rate 
we review our deposit mix and pricing weekly 
we believe that we are competitive in the type of accounts and interest rates we offer on our deposit products 
we do not seek to pay the highest deposit rates  but a competitive rate 
management determines the rates paid based on a number of conditions  including rates paid by competitors  rates on us treasury securities  rates offered on alternative lending programs  and the deposit growth rate we are seeking to achieve

the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the loss in was the million goodwill impairment that was recognized as a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation testing

net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the company s net interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  during the company experienced a three basis point increase in the net interest margin from for to for this increase in the net interest margin was caused in part by a basis point decrease in the company s average cost of funds from in to for the benefit from the lower cost of funds was partly offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on assets from in to in the lower average rates during were primarily due to a series of decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board during that resulted in a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate during the year from at the beginning of to at the end of at december   the company had approximately million in loans  or of the company s loan portfolio  repricing each month  the majority of which were tied to the prime lending rate 
also contributing to the net interest margin expansion was a million increase in the company s average interest earning assets from million in to million in however  average interest costing liabilities also increased by million from million in to million in which partly offset the effects of the increase in average interest earning assets 
the following two tables set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities for the respective periods ended december the first table details the company s average assets and average liabilities and the respective yield or cost of each of the components that are detailed 
changes in interest income and interest expense can result from changes in both volume and rates 
the second table sets forth information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated 
for each category of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume which are changes in average volume multiplied by the average rate for the previous period  ii changes in rates which are changes in average rate multiplied by the average volume for the previous period  and iii changes in rate volume  which are changes in average rate multiplied by the changes in average volume 
the total change is the sum of the previous columns

interest income from loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was caused by an basis point decrease in the average yield on loans in to reflecting lower market interest rates in this decrease was partly offset by a million increase in the average balance for loans in to million 
interest earned on interest bearing bank balances decreased by  or  to  in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield of interest bearing bank balances to in however  the negative effects of this decrease in the average yield were partly offset by a million increase in the average balance in interest earned on investment securities decreased by  or  to million in this decrease in interest income on investment securities was due to an million  or  decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in coupled with an basis point decrease in the average yield to for interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds from in to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to in  reflecting lower market interest rates in the positive impact of a decrease in the cost of deposits was partly offset by a million  or  increase in average deposits in average deposits increased due to organic growth generated from the company s primary market area 
interest paid on borrowed money decreased by  or  to million in average borrowings decreased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased by five basis points to for average borrowings decreased due to maturities that were funded by cash flow funds generated from deposit growth 
the company may increase the level of borrowings to provide liquidity for operating purposes  to purchase investment securities  fund loan growth  and offset any deposit decreases 
if these borrowing levels increase  we expect there will be a corresponding increase in interest expense 
provision for loan losses 
the company provided million and million in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses was increased due to an increase in non performing assets  coupled with net charge offs of million during in  the charlotte metropolitan area experienced decreases in housing prices  an increased unemployment rate  decreased housing starts and housing sales and decreased commercial activity 
however  the economic slowdown in the charlotte metropolitan area has generally been less severe than the economic slowdown experienced in other large metropolitan areas of the country 
due to the slowdown in the local economy  the level of non performing loans increased by million  to million at december  as a result  the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans increased from at december   to at december  also  other real estate owned increased by million to million at december  non performing assets increased by million to million at december   resulting in an increase in the ratio of non performing assets to total assets from at december   to at december  refer to allowance for loan losses for further discussion 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million  or  from million in to million in the following table presents the detail of noninterest income for the years ended december   and december  variance dollars in thousands noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts mortgage banking income other loan fees net gain on sale of investments net loss on sale of other assets commissions on sales of financial products dividends on fhlb stock income from bank owned life insurance other income total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of an increased number of demand deposit accounts which generate monthly service charges and non sufficient funds nsf fees on overdrafts 
however  recent legislation limiting the collection of nsf fees beginning in july will have an adverse impact on future fee income from deposit accounts 
mortgage banking income increased largely due to higher mortgage loan originations resulting from lower market interest rates  a reduced number of competitors  and the federal tax credit for first time home buyers 
this federal tax credit for first time home buyers was scheduled to expire in november  but was extended to april and was expanded to include additional qualified home buyers 
mortgage loan originations could decrease after the expiration of this tax credit or in the event that market interest rates increase 
other loan fees decreased primarily due to a slowdown in originations of speculative residential loans and acquisition and development loans 
both of these types of loans generally generate attractive fee income 
given the current state of the local housing market  management does not expect to originate a significant amount of these types of loans in  resulting in a continued decrease in fee income from lending activity for the increase in the net gain on sale of investments was due to the sale of million of investment securities 
these securities were sold primarily for the purpose of shortening the duration of the investment portfolio and reduce the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s equity position 
the company may continue to shorten the duration of its investment portfolio in  however  it is unlikely that there will be any material gains recognized from the sales of investments in the increase in the net loss on sale of other assets was primarily related to losses incurred from the sale of million of other real estate 
given the company s increasing portfolio of other real estate owned  additional losses will likely be recognized from the disposal of its other real estate owned 
commissions on sales of financial products decreased due to a reduced level of activity 
much of the company s level of activity is related to the performance of the stock market 
dividend income on fhlb stock decreased as the fhlb suspended most dividend payments during the fhlb recently reinstated its dividend payment to stockholders at the end of  which should result in higher dividend payments in income from bank owned life insurance increased slightly due to the company transferring a portion of its policies to a higher yielding insurance product 
other noninterest income increased primarily as a result of a  increase from the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets 
this increase in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets was offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no impact on net income 
noninterest expense 
the company s noninterest expense increased by million from million in to million in the following table presents the detail of noninterest expense for the years ended december  and december  variance dollars in thousands noninterest expense compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment expense office supplies expense advertising professional services telephone and communications data processing deposit insurance amortization of intangible assets valuation adjustment on other real estate owned impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill restructuring expense other expenses total noninterest expense the goodwill impairment charge of million was the result of the company s annual goodwill impairment test 
pursuant to accounting regulations  goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis 
as such  the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
performing a goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in performing the first step  the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit which was determined to be the company using a market value approach that utilizes the company s current stock price as the primary indicator of fair market value 
the results of the first step indicated that the fair value of the company was less than the book value of the company 
as such  the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the million in outstanding goodwill was fully impaired and had a fair value of the primary factors in the determination of goodwill impairment was the relatively low stock price of the company and the resulting low market valuation 
these factors were largely attributed to the low market wide valuations for financial institutions which impacted the company s market valuation 
the goodwill impairment was a non cash expense and will not impact future operating performance 
compensation and benefits expense decreased by primarily as a result of a reduced number of employees 
the company reduced its employment base through attrition and targeted layoffs as a result of the slowing economic conditions 
these reductions were largely focused in the areas related to commercial real estate due to the decreased originations in this area 
as economic conditions improve  the company will likely increase its number of employees which will increase future compensation expense 
occupancy expense decreased by largely due to lower depreciation expense resulting from the complete depreciation of several large fixed assets related to the company s data processing 
occupancy expense is expected to increase slightly in as we have remodeled our operations center and we plan to move from our leased stallings branch office into a new leased branch office in indian trail 
office supplies decreased due to higher expenses incurred in related to opening a new office and improved pricing from a new supply vendor 
advertising cost decreased due to a reduced level of marketing during this economic slowdown 
as economic conditions improve  advertising costs may increase 
professional fees increased primarily as a result of  in fees related to the preparation and filing of regulatory documents in conjunction with a stock offering which was withdrawn due to unfavorable market conditions 
also  the company paid  for restructuring a portion of its fhlb advances 
telephone expense increased slightly due to communication upgrades and the addition on a new location in data processing increased due to an increased number of customer accounts and software upgrades and enhancements 
the decrease in the amortization of intangible assets was due to the normal decrease associated with amortizing the core deposit intangible on an accelerated basis 
estimated amortization expense in is expected to be  deposit insurance increased due to a  special assessment paid by the company in and an increase in the overall deposit assessment rate 
this special assessment and increase in the assessment rate was charged by the fdic to all insured financial institutions as a result of depleted deposit reserve levels resulting from the increase number of bank failures during the company s fdic deposit insurance expense is not expected to decrease in during the company recognized a  valuation adjustment on other real estate owned 
this represented the decrease in the market value of real estate acquired by the company though foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
additional valuation adjustments on other real estate owned may be incurred in if real estate values continue to decrease 
in there were restructuring costs of  related to severance and other costs related to a realignment of the company s management structure 
there were no such charges in and no such charges currently planned for the impairment of investment securities in and was primarily related to a  impairment on a million trust preferred collateralized debt obligation that was determined to be other than temporary 
the current book value of this investment has been written down to  and no further impairments on this investment are expected in other noninterest expense increased primarily due to higher costs related to managing the company s other real estate owned portfolio 
these expenses include unpaid taxes  insurance  and maintenance 
income taxes 
the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of  for the change in the tax provision was primarily due to a million decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to due to a larger percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
management expects to decrease its level of income generated from tax advantaged sources in  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate for comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and overview 
the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings resulted in a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income 
the company s net interest income was flat at million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  during the company experienced a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from for to for the compression of the net interest margin was caused in part by a series of decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board during that resulted in a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate during the year from at the end of to at the end of at december   the company had approximately million in loans  or of the company s loan portfolio  repricing each month  the majority of which were tied to the prime lending rate 
this sharp decrease in short term interest rates did not provide sufficient time for many of the company s time deposits to reprice at a lower interest rate 
as a result  the yield on assets for decreased at a faster rate than the decrease in the cost of funds  causing the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to decrease from to 
when short term interest rates stabilize  the company s net interest margin should begin to expand as its portfolio of time deposits reprices at lower market rates without commensurate offsetting decreases in the yield on its prime based loan portfolio 
the negative effects of the net interest margin compression were largely offset by strong balance sheet growth during the year 
during  the company s average interest earning assets increased from million in to million in interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was largely due to the fact that the average yield on interest earning assets decreased by basis points from for compared to for the decrease in average asset yields was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate during the negative effects of the decreased average yield on interest earning assets were partly offset by a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets from million in to million in average outstanding loans increased by million  or from million to million  while the average yield on loans decreased from in to for these changes were primarily the result of organic loan growth during the year  and lower market interest rates during as a result  interest income on loans decreased by million  or  to million in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances decreased by  or  to  in the average balance of interest bearing bank balances decreased by million  or  to million and the average yield on these deposits decreased by basis points to 
interest earned on investment securities increased by  or  to million in tax equivalent adjustments using a tax rate were made to interest income on investment securities in the amounts of  and  for and  respectively 
this increase in interest income on investment securities was also partly offset by a million  or  decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in the average tax equivalent yield on investment securities increased by basis points to for due to an increased level of higher yielding municipal securities during interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds from in to in partly offsetting this decrease in the average cost of funds was a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits due to falling interest rates during the positive impact of a decrease in the cost of deposits was partly offset by a million  or  increase in average deposits in average deposits increased due to organic growth generated from the company s primary market area 
interest paid on borrowed money increased by  or  to million in average borrowings increased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased from in to in average borrowings increased in order to fund loan growth  purchase mortgage backed securities  and fund decreases in deposits 
provision for loan losses 
the company provided million and million in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses increased due to strong organic growth in the company s loan portfolio of million  coupled with net charge offs of million during the year 
in  the charlotte metropolitan area experienced decreases in housing prices  an increased unemployment rate  decreased housing starts and housing sales and decreased commercial activity 
however  the economic slowdown in the charlotte metropolitan area has generally been less severe than the economic slowdown experienced in other large metropolitan areas of the country 
due to the slowdown in the local economy  the level of non performing loans increased by million  to million at december  as a result  the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans increased from at december   to at december  also  other real estate owned increased by million to million at december  the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation portfolio loans and the company s loan portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that are considered sub prime 
therefore  none of the foreclosures were the result of any sub prime lending activity by the company 
the properties acquired through foreclosure consisted of one to four family residential properties  two residential lots and one commercial building located in the company s primary lending area 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
non performing assets increased by million to million at december   resulting in an increase in the ratio of non performing assets to total assets from at december   to at december  refer to allowance for loan losses for further discussion

the decrease in mortgage banking income was largely due to reduced mortgage loan originations during as a result of the slowdown in the local housing market 
as a result of the slowdown in the local mortgage market  many local competitors have exited the market 
the decrease in other loan fee income was primarily due to a slowdown in originations of speculative residential lending and acquisition and development lending activity 
both of these types of loans generally generate attractive fee income 
the net gain on sale of investments increased due to the sale of million in investment securities for a net gain of  in during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities at a net loss of  the net loss on sale of other assets was due to the sale of  of real estate acquired through foreclosure at a net loss of  and  of fixed assets at a net loss of  in during  the company sold  of real estate acquired through foreclosure at a net loss of   of loans at a net gain of  and  of fixed assets at a net gain of  commissions on sales of financial products decreased due to reduced level of activity which was largely related to the poor performance of the stock market in compared to dividends on fhlb stock decreased due to lower dividend payments resulting from the significant decrease in interest rates during in  the company recognized  in net life insurance proceeds as a result of the untimely death of one of the company s officers 
the company did not recognize any life insurance benefits in other income decreased in primarily due to a mark to market adjustment made on deferred compensation assets 
this mark to market adjustment was offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation  resulting in no impact to net income 
noninterest expense 
the company s noninterest expense increased by million  or  from million in to million in the following table presents the detail of noninterest expense for the years ended december  and december  variance dollars in thousands noninterest expense compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment expense office supplies expense advertising professional services telephone and communications data processing deposit insurance amortization of intangible assets impairment of investment securities restructuring expense other expenses total noninterest expense in compensation and benefits expense increased by  primarily due to additional staffing related to the opening of a new full service branch office in the first quarter of occupancy expense increased slightly in during  the company closed one mortgage loan origination office and consolidated two other mortgage loan origination offices into existing branch offices 
all of the loan production offices were located in leased space 
also during  the company opened a full service office in rock hill  south carolina in a leased building

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risks market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished market values and or reduced net interest income in future periods 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the structure of the company s loan and deposit portfolios is such that significant changes in interest rates could adversely impact net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account  nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s alco monitors the company s level of interest rate sensitivity and ensures that the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and focusing on growing the company s core deposit portfolio 
interest rate sensitivity 
the ots requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv and the net interest income nii of the bank would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv and nii from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in npv and nii at december   as calculated by an independent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
the bank s level of sensitivity  given a hypothetical  immediate  and sustained change in interest rates from basis points to basis points  is within the range of acceptable sensitivity established by the board of directors and is detailed on the following table 
hypothetical  immediate  estimated theoretical estimated theoretical and sustained net interest income net portfolio value changes in interest rates amount change amount change dollars in thousands basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise no change basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results
