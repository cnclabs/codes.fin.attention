these factors include  but are not limited to  economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors affecting our operations  markets  products  services  and prices 
the cautionary statements made pursuant to the reform act herein and elsewhere by us should not be construed as exhaustive 
we cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
in addition  readers are urged to consider statements that include the terms believes  belief  expects  plans  objectives  anticipates  intends  or the like to be uncertain and forward looking 
over time  our actual results  performance  or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results  performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward looking statements  and such difference might be significant and harmful to our stockholders interest 
many important factors that could cause such a difference are described under the caption risk factors  in item a of this annual report  which you should review carefully 
management s discussion and analysis introduction we are a recognized leader in the design  manufacture  and installation of laboratory and technical furniture products 
laboratory furniture products include both steel and wood cabinetry  fume hoods  flexible systems  and worksurfaces 
technical furniture products include workstations  workbenches  computer enclosures  and network storage systems 
our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in statesville  north carolina 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and bangalore  india that serve the asian and middle east markets 
although only approximately of our sales were through our international subsidiaries in fiscal year  these sales are considered an important part of our long term growth strategy 
our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents  a national distributor  and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries 
products are sold principally to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial  chemical  and commercial research laboratories  educational institutions  healthcare institutions  governmental entities  manufacturing facilities  and users of networking furniture 
we consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive  with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding 
it is common in the laboratory furniture industry for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates  as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed 
changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale 
since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between quotation of an order and delivery of the product 
the impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price 
the principal raw materials and products manufactured by others used in our products are cold rolled carbon and stainless steel  hardwood lumbers and plywood  paint  chemicals  resins  hardware  plumbing and electrical fittings 
such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition a portion of our product sales result from fixed price construction contracts that involve a signed contract for a fixed price to provide our laboratory furniture and fume hoods for a construction project 
we are usually in the role of a subcontractor  but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end user of the products 
our contract arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered items 
product sales resulting from fixed price construction contracts are generated from multiple element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements 
the company has determined that its multiple element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are product sales and installation services 
there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the product sales and installation services  and allocation of arrangement consideration for each of these units is based on their relative fair values 
each of these elements represents 
table of contents individual units of accounting  as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis 
the company s products are regularly sold on a stand alone basis to customers which provides vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fair value of installation services is separately calculated using expected costs of installation services 
many times the value of installation services is calculated using price quotations from subcontractors to the company  who perform installation services on a stand alone basis 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment 
product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor 
this category includes product sales for standard products  as well as products which require some customization 
these sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board fob shipping point and do not include rights of return 
accordingly  these sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  a general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold  and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials and other inventory costs more quickly than other methods 
inventories at our international subsidiaries are measured at actual cost 
pension benefits we sponsor pension plans covering all employees who met eligibility requirements as of april  in february  our pension plans were amended as of april  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date  and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods 
results of operations sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic operations sales for the year were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the sales decline resulted from lower sales of small and mid sized projects  as customers deferred placing these orders due to the recession  and lower sales from international operations 
international operations sales for the year were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the international laboratory furniture marketplace was hit particularly hard by the economic slowdown  but appeared to show signs of recovery late in the year as quotation activity increased 
our order backlog was million at april   as compared to million at april   and million at april  sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic operations sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from the prior year 
international operations sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
gross profit represented   and of sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to savings from alternative sources of raw materials and components  cost improvements  and increased manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year associated with higher production volumes 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to higher costs for certain key raw materials  higher energy and transportation costs  and increased competitive pricing in the marketplace

the increase in operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 
table of contents resulted primarily from an increase of million in pension expense  an increase of  in sales and marketing expenses  and an increase of  in deprecation expense 
the pension expense increase primarily resulted from the prior fiscal year s decline in the market value of pension investments 
the impact of these items was partially offset by a decrease of  in compensation earned under performance incentive plans 
the increase in operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year included an increase of  in pension expense  an increase of  in depreciation expense for computer systems  and an increase of  in sales commissions due to the increase in sales 
other income was  in fiscal year other expense was  in fiscal year and other income was  in fiscal year interest expense was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively

income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings  was recorded in fiscal year income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings  was recorded in fiscal year income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings  was recorded in fiscal year the effective tax rate for each of these years is lower than the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of tax rates for the company s international subsidiaries and the impact of state and federal tax credits 
net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to our two subsidiaries that are not owned by the company were   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the changes in the net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest for each year were due to changes in the levels of net income of the subsidiaries 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per diluted share 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per diluted share

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities  supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  certain machinery and equipment are financed by non cancelable operating leases or capital leases 
we believe that these sources of funds  along with long term bank financing  will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements  including capital expenditures  through fiscal year at april   we had advances of million outstanding under our unsecured million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility matures in july see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information concerning our credit facility 
during fiscal year  we entered into capital lease arrangements related to costs of  associated with a new enterprise resource planning erp system that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these lease arrangements  as well as most of our leases for machinery and equipment  provide us with renewal and purchase options and certain early cancellation rights 
the following table summarizes the cash payment obligations including interest  if applicable  for our lease arrangements as of april  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements at april  operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  primarily from operating earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory

operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  primarily from operating earnings and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory  and a decrease in deferred revenue 
the majority of the april  accounts receivable balances are expected to be collected during the first quarter of fiscal year  with the exception of retention amounts on fixed price contracts which are collected when the entire construction project is completed and all retention funds are paid by the owner 

table of contents as discussed above  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under our pension plans after april   and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
we did not make any contributions to the plans in fiscal years   and the company anticipates that contributions in the amount of  will be required for fiscal year capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively

recent accounting standards new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued revised guidance for the accounting for business combinations 
the revised guidance  which is now part of fasb asc  requires the fair value measurement of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  at the acquisition date with limited exceptions 
previously  a cost allocation approach was used to allocate the cost of the acquisition based on the estimated fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost allocation approach treated acquisition related costs and restructuring costs that the acquirer expected to incur as a liability on the acquisition date as part of the cost of the acquisition 
under the revised guidance those costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations separately from the business combination 
in april  fasb amended the guidance on the initial recognition measurement and subsequent accounting for contingencies arising in business combinations 
the revised guidance applies to business combinations for acquisitions occurring on or after january  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

in august  the fasb issued update no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
the revised guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques i the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  ii quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or iii other valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of topic asu was effective for reporting periods beginning after issuance 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under fasb asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes i eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and ii eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued update no

the update also clarifies existing requirements about fair value measurement disclosures and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods  beginning after december   except for the reconciliation of level activity  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt this standard in fiscal year the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of this standard will have on the company s financial position or results of operations 
outlook our current expectations are that fiscal year will again be profitable for the company 
however  we are unable to predict the timing and strength of the global economic recovery and its short term and long term impact on our operations and the laboratory furniture industry in general 
the future demand for our products also continues to be limited given the company s role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors 
in addition to the above factors affecting the company and our markets  demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and or current progress in projects already under construction 
our earnings are also impacted by increased costs of raw materials  including stainless steel  wood  and epoxy resin  and whether we are able to increase product prices to customers in amounts that correspond to such increases without materially and adversely affecting sales 
additionally  since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between the quotation of an order and delivery of a product 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is associated with advances outstanding under our bank line of credit and certain lease obligations for production machinery  all of which are priced on a floating rate basis 
advances outstanding under the bank line of credit were million at april  in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable by the company on million of outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility effectively converted to a fixed interest rate of for the period beginning august   and ending august  the company entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate future interest rate risk associated with advances under the credit facility 
we believe that our exposure to market risk is not material
