in our pawn stores  we acquire inventory for retail sales through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customers merchandise and purchases of new or refurbished merchandise from third party vendors 
the gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at 
table of contents the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased 
improper value assessment in the lending or purchasing process can result in lower margins or reduced marketability of the merchandise 
one indicator of lower marketability is how long we have held the inventory

at september   of our us short term consumer loan stores and of our us pawn stores offered credit services to customers seeking short term consumer loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we do not participate in any of the loans made by the lenders  but earn a fee for helping customers obtain credit and for enhancing customers creditworthiness by providing letters of credit 
in connection with our credit services  the unaffiliated lenders offer customers two types of signature loans 
in all stores offering signature loan credit services  customers can obtain payday loans  with principal amounts up to  but averaging about terms of these loans are generally less than days  averaging about days  with due dates corresponding with the customers next payday

loan principal amounts range from to  but average about we earn a fee of to of auto title loan amounts 
on november   we acquired pawn stores located in the las vegas  nevada area for total consideration of approximately million plus direct transaction costs 
approximately half the purchase consideration was funded with the issuance of ezcorp class a non voting common stock and the remaining half was funded in cash 
results of the acquired stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition 
on december   we acquired value financial services  inc vfs 
we acquired vfs s pawn stores  mostly in florida  for a total acquisition price of million  plus the assumption of vfs s debt of million  for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this excludes million of contingent payments made since the acquisition 
the contingent payments were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital in accordance with accounting rules for contingencies based on our stock price 
results of the acquired stores are included in our results of operations beginning january  in the fiscal year ended september  we acquired sixteen pawn stores located in the chicago metropolitan area  central and south florida  corpus christi  texas and las vegas  nevada for approximately million in cash 
the stores were acquired from five separate sellers 
the results of all acquired stores have been consolidated with our results since their acquisition 
recently  legislation adversely affecting our business was enacted in colorado and wisconsin 
the colorado law  which became effective in august  essentially eliminated the traditional short term payday loan product by requiring that payday loans have a minimum term of six months and changed the allowed fees 
the wisconsin law  which becomes effective january   limits the availability of payday loans and completely eliminates auto title loans 
although we decided to close or consolidate of our short term consumer loan stores in those states  we are continuing to operate in the remaining stores with new or modified products that fit within the new regulatory frameworks and are evaluating the feasibility of additional product offerings to enhance our business in those stores 
if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new laws in either or both of these states  or if adverse legislation is passed in other states  we may decide to close or consolidate additional stores 
included in the current year is a million charge related to the closure of the stores in colorado and wisconsin

in fiscal  the us pawn operations segment contributed million greater store operating income compared to the prior year  primarily as the result of a million increase in pawn service charges  a million increase in gross profit on merchandise and jewelry scrapping sales and a million increase in other revenues  partially offset by higher operating costs 
the empe o f cil segment contributed million greater store operating income compared to the prior year  with a growth in net revenues mostly offset by higher operating costs at new stores 
our ezmoney operations segment contributed million greater store operating income  primarily from new products and an improvement in bad debt as a percent of fees

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  loan loss allowances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
you should refer to note a of our consolidated financial statements for a more complete review of other accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan and sales revenue recognition we record pawn service charges using the interest method for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible 
we base our estimate of collectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following two months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans  affecting our earnings and financial condition 
if a pawn loan is not repaid  we value the forfeited collateral inventory at the lower of cost pawn loan principal or market value of the property 
we record sales revenue and the related cost when this inventory is sold  or when we receive the final payment on a layaway sale 
signature loan credit service fee revenue recognition we earn credit service fees when we assist customers in obtaining signature loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we initially defer recognition of the fees we expect to collect  net of direct expenses  and recognize that deferred net amount over the life of the related loans 
we reserve the percentage of credit service fees we expect not to collect 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce credit service fee revenue upon loan default  and increase credit service fee revenue upon collection 
signature loan credit service fee revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
signature loan credit service bad debt we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our customers seeking signature loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed to the lenders by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fees 
although amounts paid under letters of credit may be collected later  we charge those amounts to signature loan bad debt upon default 
we record recoveries under the letters of credit as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally  we occasionally sell them to an unaffiliated company as another method of recovery  and record the proceeds from such sales as a reduction of bad debt at the time of the sale 
the majority of our credit service customers obtain short term signature loans with a single maturity date 
these short term loans  with maturity dates averaging about days  are considered defaulted if they have not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
other credit service customers obtain installment loans with a series of payments due over as much as a five month period 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire loan is considered defaulted 

table of contents allowance for losses on signature loan credit services we provide an allowance for losses we expect to incur under letters of credit for brokered signature loans that have not yet matured 
the allowance is based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
it includes all amounts we expect to pay to the unaffiliated lenders upon loan default  including loan principal  accrued interest and insufficient funds fees  net of the amounts we expect to collect from borrowers collectively  expected loc losses 
changes in the allowance are charged to signature loan bad debt 
we include the balance of expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheets 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses on signature loans was million and our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered signature loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
based on the expected loss and collection percentages  we also provide an allowance for the signature loan credit service fees we expect not to collect  and charge changes in this allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
the accuracy of our allowance estimates is dependent upon several factors  including our ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  in response to regulatory changes or for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
we believe we effectively manage these risks through our underwriting criteria and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
signature loan revenue recognition we accrue fees in accordance with state and provincial laws on the percentage of signature loans payday loans and installment loans we have made that we believe to be collectible 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce fee revenue upon loan default  and increase fee revenue upon collection 
signature loan bad debt we consider a payday loan defaulted if it has not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire installment loan is considered defaulted 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  we charge the loan principal to signature loan bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance

we record changes in the inventory valuation allowance as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of our inventory allowance is dependent on our ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in the amount  age or composition of our inventory could cause us to increase or decrease our inventory allowance 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted 
stock compensation we account for stock compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc compensation stock compensation 
the fair value of restricted stock is measured as the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant  which is amortized over the vesting period for each grant 
we have not granted any stock options since fiscal when granted  our policy is to estimate the grant date fair value of options using the black scholes merton option pricing model and amortize that fair value to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the options vesting periods 
fair value we adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities on october   resulting in no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
acquisitions we adopted fasb asc business combinations revised on october   and have applied it prospectively to all business acquisitions completed since that date 
in accordance with fasb asc  we allocate the total acquisition price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and now immediately expense transaction costs that have historically been included in the purchase price allocation under previous accounting standards

same store total revenues increased million  or 
the overall increase in total revenues was comprised of a million increase in merchandise and jewelry scrapping sales  a million increase in pawn service charges and a million increase in other revenues

table of contents our current year us pawn service charge revenue increased  or million  from the prior year to million 
same store pawn service charges increased million  or  and new and acquired stores net of closed stores contributed million 
the same store improvement was due to a higher average same store pawn loan balance coupled with a six percentage point higher yield 
the yield improved primarily due to a higher loan redemption rate as we focused on loan values and better qualifying customers to determine those that prefer to sell their merchandise rather than use it as collateral for a loan 
inventory purchases from customers increased compared to the prior year

this was due to a million increase in sales from new and acquired stores net of closed stores  a percentage point improvement in gross margin to  and a million or increase in same store sales 
gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million  or  from the prior year to million on greater volume and a percentage point improvement in gross margins to 
including a million increase from stores acquired late in the first fiscal quarter of  scrapping revenues increased million  or  on more volume  while proceeds realized per gram of jewelry scrapped increased 
jewelry scrapping sales include the sale of approximately million in the current year and million in the prior year of loose diamonds removed from scrapped jewelry 
as a result of the greater volume and a higher average cost per gram of jewelry scrapped  scrap cost of goods increased million  or 
other revenues include merchandise sale related programs and layaway fees 
other revenues increased to million in the current year  from million in the prior year  primarily from the introduction and growth of new programs and an increase in layaway transactions  following enhancements to our layaway program to make layaways more affordable to our customers 
operations expense increased to million of net revenues in the current year from million of net revenues in the prior year 
the dollar increase in expense was primarily due to higher operating costs at new and acquired stores and higher incentive compensation 
the improvement as a percent of net revenues is from greater scale at same stores and from expense management improvements made at acquired and existing stores 
in the current year  the million greater net revenue from us pawn activities  the million higher operations expense and offsetting changes in contributions from signature loans and auto title loans resulted in a million overall increase in store operating income from the us pawn operations segment 
for the current and prior year  the segment comprised of consolidated store operating income

the average exchange rate used to translate empe o f cil s current year results from mexican pesos to us dollars was stronger than in the prior year  affecting all revenue and expense items 
store operating income improved in dollars and in peso terms 
the increase in net revenues was mostly offset by higher costs from new stores that we expect will be a drag on earnings until they become profitable in their second year of operation 
approximately of the stores open at september  had been open less than a year 
we opened new stores in the current year  of which are empe e su oro jewelry only pawn stores 
these jewelry only stores are much smaller and require less staff than our typical pawn stores  but also carry smaller average loan balances per store and immediately sell for scrap any forfeited loan collateral 
empe o f cil s total revenues increased million  or  in the current year to million 
same store total revenues increased million or  and new stores contributed million 
the overall increase in total revenues was comprised of a million increase in merchandise and jewelry scrapping sales  a million increase in pawn service charges and a million increase in other revenues 
empe o f cil s pawn service charge revenues increased million  or  in the current year to million 
same store pawn service charges increased approximately million  or  and new stores contributed million 
the same store increase was due to an improvement in the average pawn loan yield coupled with an increase in average loan balance during the period 
the yield increased primarily due to an increase in pawn service charge rates in certain geographic areas compared to the prior year  partially offset by a lower loan redemption rate

this was due to a million  or same store sales increase and million in sales from new stores  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in gross margins to 
the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million to million 
the million increase in proceeds was mostly offset by a decrease in jewelry scrapping margins to  compared to in the prior year 
the significant volume increase and the margin decrease are due primarily to the introduction of our new empe e su oro jewelry only pawn stores 
as these new jewelry only stores open  the gold values employed are aggressive in the marketplace in order to establish both the new store and the brand 
we expect typical jewelry scrapping margins in mexico to remain between and as these stores mature 
operations expense increased to million of net revenues in the current year from million of net revenues in the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to new stores which typically produce a loss in their first several quarters of operation 
in the current year  the million greater net revenues were mostly offset by the million higher operations expense  resulting in a million increase in store operating income for the segment 
empe o f cil made up of consolidated store operating income in the current year compared to in the prior year 
we expect empe o f cil s operating income to grow as a percentage of our consolidated income in future periods as recently opened stores begin to mature  and new stores comprise a smaller percentage of the total stores

auto title loans and installment loans represented of the growth in the segment s total revenues 
in the current year  we opened stores in canada and closed one  bringing our total there to in august  we stopped offering short term payday loans in colorado and instead began offering six month installment loans ranging from to in principal  with a interest rate plus finance charges and maintenance fees in accordance with a new state statute 
this has shifted some of our signature loan balance from payday loans to installment loans  which is a lower yielding product  but gives us the ability to continue to serve that customer base 
the segment s signature loan net revenue increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the rapid growth in installment loans and a percentage point improvement in bad debt to of fees  net of the drag from new stores and closed or consolidated stores 
the improvement in bad debt was due to continuing improvements in the store level execution of servicing the customer and the loan  as well as enhanced productivity measurement tools and enhanced use of technology in our collections department 

table of contents the segment s net revenues from auto title loans increased to million in the current year with bad debt at of related fees 
this loan product is relatively new and had little volume in the prior year 
we expect continued growth in the contribution from auto title loans as the product matures in the ezmoney stores now offering the product 
due to a new wisconsin law that will take effect january   we will no longer offer auto title loans in wisconsin 
the ezmoney segment began buying and scrapping gold jewelry in the current year  generating million of gross profit  with a gross margin 
operations expense increased to million of net revenues from million of net revenues in the prior year 
the increase was mostly from additional labor  rent and other costs at new stores net of closed stores

administrative expenses in the current year were million of net revenues compared to million of net revenues in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an million increase in administrative labor and benefits  a million increase in professional fees and a million increase in stock compensation 
included in the increased labor and benefits is a higher accrual for incentive compensation reflective of the year s strong earnings performance and additional investments made in infrastructure to support our growth 
in the first fiscal quarter of the prior year  administrative expense includes a million bonus to two executives upon their exercise of employee stock options granted in terms of the grants required us to pay a cash bonus to the two executives equal to the related tax savings realized by the company 
we do not expect this to recur  as no other outstanding options contain similar terms 
we do expect to recognize a one time million pre tax charge in administrative expense in the quarter ending december  following the october retirement of our former chief executive officer 
the total charge includes million attributable to cash payments and million attributable to the vesting of restricted stock 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
depreciation on assets placed in service  primarily related to acquired pawn stores and new stores  was partially offset by assets that were retired or became fully depreciated during the year 
in the current year  we recognized a million loss on the closure or consolidation of several stores  including the ezmoney stores in the states of wisconsin and colorado  compared to a million gain on disposal of assets in the prior year

the operating lease obligations in the table above include expected rent for all our store locations for the full expected lease terms 
of the us ezmoney short term consumer loan stores  adjoin an ezpawn store 
the lease agreements at approximately of the remaining free standing us ezmoney stores contain provisions that limit our exposure for additional rent to only a few months if laws were enacted that had a significant 
table of contents negative effect on our operations at these stores 
if such laws were passed  the space currently utilized by stores adjoining ezpawn stores could be re incorporated into the ezpawn operations 
in fiscal  we plan to open to empe o f cil pawn locations in mexico  to cashmax payday loan locations in canada and pawn stores in the united states for an expected capital expenditure of approximately million  plus the funding of working capital and start up losses at these stores 
we believe new stores will create a drag on earnings and liquidity until their second year of operations

terms of the credit agreement require  among other things  that we meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at september  and expect to remain in compliance based on our expected future performance 
the payment of dividends and additional debt are restricted under our credit agreement 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our contractual obligations  planned store growth  capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the coming year 
off balance sheet arrangements we issue letters of credit locs to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking signature loans and auto title loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the locs assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed them by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee or late fee 
we do not record on our balance sheet the loans related to our credit services as the loans are made by unaffiliated lenders

we include an allowance for expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on locs  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest  insufficient funds fees and late fees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality historically  pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season  jewelry sales surrounding valentine s day and the impact of tax refunds in the united states 
jewelry scrapping sales are heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory 
jewelry scrapping sales generally are greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter july through september 
this results from relatively low jewelry merchandise sales in that quarter and the higher loan balance  leading to a higher dollar amount of loan forfeitures in the summer lending season providing more inventory available for sale 
signature loan fees are generally highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters april through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
signature loan bad debt  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of related fees  is highest in the third and fourth quarters and lowest in the second quarter due primarily to the impact of tax refunds 

table of contents the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the third fiscal quarter 
our cash flow typically is greatest in the second fiscal quarter due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season
