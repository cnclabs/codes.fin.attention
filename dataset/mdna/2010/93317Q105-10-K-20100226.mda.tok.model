item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk organization on april   we changed our name from walter industries  inc to walter energy  inc 
walter 
we are a leading us producer and exporter of premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry underground mining  operate surface mines for the steam coal and industrial coal markets surface mining and produce metallurgical coke walter coke 
in december  we announced the closure of our homebuilding segment and on april   we spun off our financing segment  creating walter investment management corp  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
as a result of the closure and spin off  amounts previously reported in those segments are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these actions have completed the transformation of walter industries  inc from a diversified corporation to a pure play natural resources and energy company  now renamed walter energy  inc unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition addresses our continuing operations only 
prior to  our underground and surface coal mining operations were reported together as the natural resources segment 
beginning in  we revised our reportable segments to separate the natural resources segment into underground mining and surface mining 
underground mining includes our underground hard coking coal operations from the no 
and no 
mines and its natural gas operations 
surface mining includes our surface coal mining operations for tuscaloosa resources  inc tri and taft coal sales associates  inc 
taft as well as walter minerals  inc formerly known as united land corporation results 
in addition  during we changed the name of our metallurgical coke manufacturer from sloss industries corporation to walter coke  inc previous years information has been revised to align with the new segment reporting structure and reflect all name changes 
executive discussion our key accomplishments in include we completed the transformation of the company from a diversified conglomerate into a pure play natural resources and energy company 
the spin off of walter investment management corp 
represented approximately million in value distributed to our shareholders 
at our underground mining segment  we completed mining our southwest a panel in mid december  and began production in the first longwall panel at our mine no 
east expansion 
this year  million expansion is expected to increase our annual capacity for premium coking coal to up to million tons in the expansion also makes our no 
mine the largest metallurgical coal mine in north america 
our surface mining segment generated solid cash flow in a challenging market 
on a normalized basis  excluding the fiber plant closure charges  walter coke was profitable in despite an unprecedented decline in domestic steel capacity utilization 
we paid more than million in regular dividends to our shareholders and also repurchased million in stock 
overall  we were very pleased with our performance in but more importantly  based on our current expectations we are looking forward to significant revenue and income growth in  led by increased hard coking coal production and higher prices 
in addition  we re very well positioned to capitalize on opportunities to grow the company and add significant value for our shareholders 
seaborne coking coal demand  which declined to about million tons in  is expected to rebound to about million tons in china will continue to be a key driver  with coking coal imports continuing at a strong pace in other pacific basin countries are also expected to grow strongly 
because of demand in asia  some metallurgical coal supply from australia  canada and the us that normally would have moved into the atlantic basin will likely be diverted to the pacific basin 
recent increases in commitments of coal out of the u 
s are examples of this trend  which will add to the pressure on supply into our strategic markets of europe and south america 
we also see a rebound in these regions  with metallurgical coal imports expected to increase percent in europe and percent in south america 
our performance  discussed in more detail below  demonstrates how well our business performs through a difficult cycle and affirms our confidence as the global steel industry improves 
we re looking forward to an outstanding and expect significant organic revenue and income growth and corresponding increases in cash flow 
we plan to use our expected strong financial performance as a platform for continued growth 
we are encouraged by the number and quality of projects in our strategic pipeline 
in addition  we have been consistently repurchasing our shares  with almost million shares repurchased in at an average price of per share  including about  shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of  and another  shares so far in at an average price of 
regarding  our planned million short tons sales volume within our underground mining segment equates to million metric tons  of which million metric tons are contracted at an average price of per metric ton 
the remaining million metric tons are open to pricing in an extremely strong market 
looking beyond  we expect continued growth in metallurgical coal demand globally  with imports possibly reaching million tons or more over the next three years 
this outlook includes a compound annual growth rate of almost percent in demand in both of our current core business areas of south america and europe 
this strong market environment emphasizes walter energy s investment considerations and growth prospects with our mine no 
east expansion complete and operating  we have already grown our metallurgical coal franchise and expect coking coal production capacity to reach up to million tons in our coking coal product is among the highest qualities in the world 
our low and mid vol coals possess the chemical and physical characteristics  including high coke strength and good fluidity  that steel producers prefer 
our strategic market areas of europe and south america  where we have meaningful transportation advantages  remain important but we will continue to explore opportunities outside of our traditional distribution footprint 
we believe that demand for high quality  hard coking coals  will continue to grow and that these raw materials will continue to grow in scarcity  particularly for the highest grade coals  such as ours

metallurgical coke pricing and volumes were down in primarily due to weak demand in the domestic steel market 
the decrease in coking coal sales volumes was due to lower sales of purchased coal 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  decreased million in compared to cost of sales represented of net sales and revenues in  up from in for the most part  cost of sales dollars decreased in line with the decrease in net sales 
however  the effect of lower average pricing at underground mining and walter coke contributed to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
depreciation expense in increased million compared to the increase was primarily due to our continued investment in the expansion of underground mining s mine operations

restructuring and impairment charges in includes million for the closure of walter coke s fiber plant in december  while includes a charge of million related to the impairment in the value of taft s mineral interests as of december  operating income is million in  down million versus  primarily due to lower coking coal  metallurgical coke and natural gas pricing and lower metallurgical coke volumes  with lower pricing of these products making up percent of the decrease in operating income 
net interest expense increased million in from  primarily as a result of million of interest income that was included in  which did not recur in  for a black lung excise tax refund claim 
the total amount of the claim recorded in was million 
of this amount  million was received in the effect of this item was partially offset by the effect of a reduction in both the weighted average borrowings and the weighted average interest rate in as compared to our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is lower than primarily due to a permanent tax benefit of million recognized in for non taxable opeb medicare part d subsidies and a million net tax benefit recognized in relating to a change in the effective state tax rate 
excluding these items  the effective tax rate in would have been 
both the and effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of percentage depletion deductions 
outlook for our operating segments in addition to the general overview discussions above  the following discussion provides specific operating and forward looking information regarding each of our operating segments 
underground mining we produced and sold approximately million tons of hard coking coal in  compared to million tons in  despite historic lows in global steel capacity utilization 
coking coal sales are expected to total approximately million tons 
the growth in coking coal sales volume is expected to be derived from additional production from the start up of longwall operations at mine no 
east  purchased coal and coal available in inventory 
we recently concluded settlement of our remaining carryover tons priced at approximately per metric ton and expect to deliver million short tons in and million short tons in the first quarter of coking coal sales committed and priced for are projected as follows coking coal sales committed and priced short tons in millions q e q e q e q e carryover tons contract tons na na pricing on all carryover tons is at original contract of approximately per metric ton fob port approximately per short ton fob port 
pricing on the benchmark tons is at approximately per metric ton fob port approximately per short ton fob port 
the remainder of forecasted coking coal sales volume for is unpriced 
given the current market environment  we expect to achieve record average realized pricing in in the fourth quarter of  we sold million short tons at an operating income of per ton 
our sales volume expectation for the first quarter of ranges from million to million tons and our forecasted first quarter operating income per ton ranges from to 
the fourth quarter includes million tons at carryover pricing of approximately per metric ton  while the first quarter forecast includes million tons at this carryover pricing 
with our mine no 
east expansion longwall in full operation  as noted above  our overall hard coking coal production is expected to total to million tons in the first quarter  with costs averaging between and per ton 
two longwall moves in the first quarter will result in slightly lower production volumes and a slightly higher cost per ton compared to our full year cost projection of to per ton 
due to slower than planned development rates on the replacement north longwall panel at mine no 
 startup of the next panel will have an extended day delay between the first and second quarters of we expect total hard coking coal production tons for the second quarter to be between and million tons at a cost of to per ton 
we expect to increase coking coal production to between and million tons in and between and million tons in transportation and handling costs on metallurgical coal sales are expected to remain consistent in the first quarter of as compared to  at an average of to per ton 
royalty expenses were of hard coking coal revenues in  but are expected to return to our normal average of to of hard coking coal revenues in now that production for mine no 
s southwest a panel has been completed 
our natural gas business sold billion cubic feet of natural gas at an average price of per thousand cubic feet in versus billion cubic feet at per thousand cubic feet in pricing forecasts for have recently strengthened 
in october  we hedged the sale of approximately of our full year production  or bcf  at per thousand cubic feet 
we will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities  potential acquisitions and further investments in coal and natural gas 
surface mining during  our surface mining operations sold million tons of steam and industrial coal at an average selling price of per ton  as compared to million tons at an average selling price of per ton in results in benefited from a full year of production from taft  which was acquired in september  as well as increased pricing at tri on new contracts that began in january in the fourth quarter of  we sold  tons at an average operating income of per ton 
in the first quarter of  we expect to sell between  and  tons at an average operating income per ton of between and 
we expect surface mining to produce and sell to million tons in  with all expected sales volumes priced 
operating results for are expected to remain consistent with the results in walter coke walter coke sold  tons of metallurgical coke at an average price of per ton in in  we sold  tons at an average price of per ton 
the decline in average selling price and sales volume reflect lower domestic steel capacity utilization in versus coke sales in the fourth quarter of were  tons at an average operating income of per ton 
this operating income per ton excludes million of pre tax charges for the december closure of walter coke s fiber plant 
first quarter coke sales are expected to be between  and  tons at an average operating margin per ton of between and 
production has increased during the year from a low of coking ovens per day to coking ovens per day by the end of  and we expect to return to full production of approximately ovens per day by april we expect sales to be between  and  tons 
pricing beyond the first quarter for furnace coke remains uncertain and is subject to negotiation 
the current and prior year period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis underground mining underground mining s revenues decreased million to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was due to lower average selling prices of coking coal  while of the decrease was due to lower coking coal volumes 
lower natural gas pricing resulted in a million decrease in revenues  or approximately of the total decrease 
for the years ended december  average coal selling price per ton at the port tons of coal sold in thousands average hedged natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells underground mining reported a decrease in operating income of million in  compared to approximately of the decrease in operating income is attributable to decreased pricing of coking coal and natural gas 
lower coking coal volumes  increased labor costs and depreciation expense contributed to the remainder of the decrease in operating income 
surface mining surface mining reported a revenue increase of million in compared to more than of the increase in revenues is due to an increase in the average coal selling price at tri  while the remainder is due to volume increases  primarily related to the acquisition of taft in september statistics for surface mining are presented in the following table for the years ended december  average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold in thousands surface mining reported operating income of million in versus an operating loss of million in the results include a million impairment charge related to a decline in value of taft s mineral interests as of december  excluding this charge  operating income in was million 
the million improvement in operating income from is almost entirely due to an increase in average coal selling prices 
walter coke walter coke s revenues decreased million in  compared to  due to decreased customer demand in the weak domestic steel market 
approximately of the decrease in revenues is due to lower volumes  with the remainder due to a decrease in metallurgical coke selling price as indicated in the table below for the years ended december  metallurgical coke average selling price per ton metallurgical coke tons sold walter coke s operating loss was million in compared to an operating profit of million in approximately of the decline in operating results is due to lower volumes  while approximately is due to lower average selling prices 
in addition  walter coke recorded a million restructuring and impairment charge and million of inventory write downs in the fourth quarter related to the closure of walter coke s fiber plant

surface mining results in include a full year for tri  which was acquired in september  and four months from taft  which was acquired in september cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  for increased million from cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to the effect of increases in metallurgical coal and coke pricing which significantly exceeded the effect of increased costs at underground mining and walter coke  respectively 
operating income was million in  a million increase from the majority of the increase was due to increased selling prices for both metallurgical coal and coke in  the effect of which was partially offset by a million impairment of the value of taft s mineral interests in our effective tax rate for continuing operations in and was and  respectively 
both years rates are lower than the statutory rate due to the benefit of percentage depletion deductions 
the results of discontinued operations in includes a tax benefit of million from the deemed liquidation for income tax purposes of homebuilding resulting from the decision to close this business 
the current and prior year results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis underground mining underground mining reported revenues of million in  an increase of million from million in approximately of the increase in revenues was attributable to increased coking coal pricing 
increased volumes of coking coal contributed to approximately of the increase 
for the years ended december  average coal selling price per ton at the port tons of coal sold in thousands average hedged natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells for  underground mining s operating income was million  compared to operating income of million in results in benefited from the effect of record metallurgical coal pricing  which was partially offset by higher production costs 
production costs per ton for were higher than due to inflationary increases in labor and materials as well as a higher mix of continuous miner tons versus longwall tons 
in addition  operating income benefited from a increase in production over the prior year but decreased due to higher depreciation expense 
surface mining surface mining reported revenues of million in compared to million in of the million increase  million is due to an additional eight months of revenues generated by tri in versus  resulting from the september acquisition of tri  and million of the increase is due to the september acquisition of taft 
partially offsetting these items is a slight decrease in revenues at tri due to lower average selling prices in compared to statistics for surface mining are presented in the following table for the years ended december  average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold in thousands surface mining reported an operating loss of million in versus operating income of million in the results in include a million impairment charge related to the decline in value of taft s mineral interests as of december  see critical accounting estimates for additional discussion of this impairment charge 
excluding this charge  operating income in was million  or a million improvement in as compared to the improvement in operating income is due to the addition of taft and a full year of operating income at tri 
the increase from these subsidiaries was partially offset by the effect of a gain on the sale of land at walter minerals in that did not recur in walter coke net sales and revenues were million for  an increase of million compared to this increase in revenues is due to an increase in metallurgical coke pricing as shown in the table below  which more than offset a slight decrease in tons sold 
for the years ended december  metallurgical coke tons sold metallurgical coke average selling price per ton walter coke reported operating income of million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million 
most of the increase results from the increase in metallurgical coke pricing  partially offset by higher raw material coal cost and a million charge related to the resolution of a legal matter 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december  to million at december  reflecting million in cash flows provided by operating activities  partially offset by million of cash flows used in investing activities and million of cash flows used in financing activities 
see additional discussion in the statement of cash flows section that follows 
net receivables were million at december   a decrease of million from december  primarily attributable to lower sales at underground mining in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of also  net receivables declined million due to the cash receipt of a black lung excise tax refund claim  which was recorded in december inventories were million at december   an increase of million from december  primarily due to increased inventories at surface mining and walter coke  as production at these segments exceeded shipments in the current portion of our net deferred income tax asset was million at december   an increase of million from december   primarily due to an increase in the expected utilization of our net operating loss carryforward during the next twelve months 
accounts payable decreased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to lower freight payables at underground mining and lower raw material purchases at walter coke due to reduced activity 
accrued expenses decreased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to lower workers compensation liabilities  lower state tax liabilities and lower litigation related claims liabilities 
long term debt decreased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to million in payments made on our revolving line of credit during the long term portion of the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation was million at december   up million from million at december  due to an increase in the number of inactive participants  a decrease in the discount rate  an increase in the medical trend assumption  a change in the mortality assumptions and unfavorable claims experience for the united mine workers of america postretirement benefit plan  all of which caused an million actuarially determined increase to the liability as of december  this adjustment is recognized as a decrease to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of short term funding are our existing cash balances  operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our principal source of long term funding is our bank term loan 
as of december   total debt decreased million as compared to december  see discussion below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  operating cash flows and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet substantially all operating needs  to make planned capital expenditures and to make all required interest and principal payments on indebtedness for the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors  including prices and sales of coal and natural gas  coal production  costs of raw materials  interest rates and the general economy 
although markets have generally improved during the second half of  there remains uncertainty in the financial markets  less availability and higher relative costs of credit 
while we have no indication that the uncertainty in the financial markets would impact our current credit facility or our current credit providers  the possibility does exist 
walter credit agreement in  we entered into a million credit agreement walter credit agreement which included  prior to its amendments  an amortizing term loan facility with an initial aggregate principal amount of million  million and million of which was outstanding as of december  and with weighted average interest rates of and respectively  and an initial million revolving credit facility revolver which provides for loans and letters of credit 
our obligations under the walter credit agreement credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our and our guarantors real  personal and intellectual property  and our ownership interest in the guarantors 
under the credit agreement  we are allowed to pay dividends and repurchase our own capital stock up to a maximum of million plus of consolidated net income from the immediately preceding year  provided that after such dividend and or stock purchase  the remaining amount available to be drawn under the revolver is at least million 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of million through october   at which time the remaining outstanding principal is due 
in  we amended the credit agreement to increase the revolver to million 
available funds of million were used to repay principal  interest and fees and terminate certain debt related to our financing business prior to its spin off 
the amendment also increased the interest rate on the revolver and the term loan to as much as libor plus basis points 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver also increased from per year to per year 
in addition  the amended walter credit agreement contained a reducing revolver commitment feature  where the total available revolver commitment would not exceed million at march   million at june   million at september   and million at december  certain other terms  including affirmative and negative covenants as well as restrictions on our ability to engage in specified activities  were also amended  and included  but were not limited to  increased indebtedness and approval of certain activities associated with our strategic initiatives in businesses that are now discontinued 
in connection with the amendment to the credit agreement  we incurred million of refinancing fees 
these fees were deferred and are being amortized over the remaining life of the revolver 
during  we borrowed million under the revolver 
on june   we completed an offering of shares of our common stock and received million of net proceeds  as more fully discussed in note the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay million on the outstanding term loan and million on the revolver 
additional repayments during totaled million  leaving a revolver balance of million at december  this remaining balance was repaid during under the terms of our amended credit agreement  availability under the revolver was reduced from million to million in connection with the completion of the stock offering 
in connection with the repayments discussed above  we recognized additional amortization of million of previously deferred financing fees  which was included in interest expense in the statement of operations 
in we amended the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the revolver from october  to july  and amend the size of the revolver to million that  subject to certain conditions  can be increased to million 
the amendment also increases the interest rate on the revolver by basis points to as much as libor plus basis points 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver was set at per year for all pricing levels compared to a range of to per year prior to the change 
in addition  certain financial covenants in the credit agreement were eliminated 
the amendment did not affect the term loan portion of the credit agreement 
as of december   the term loan currently bears interest at libor plus basis points 
as of december   we had million in outstanding stand by letters of credit  of which million relates to the support letter of credit discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  revolver borrowings  and million of availability for future borrowings under the revolver 
other debt in october  we entered into a million equipment financing arrangement for certain previously procured mining equipment 
this facility requires monthly payments using a commercial mortgage style amortization  carries an interest rate of month libor plus basis points  will mature in the first quarter of and is secured by the financed equipment 
at december   there was million outstanding at a stated interest rate of 
in addition  in  we entered into a million capital lease arrangement to procure certain mining equipment 
the capital lease covers a sixty month period and has an implicit fixed interest rate of 
at december  there was a balance remaining of million 
in june  we entered into a million arrangement to finance the premium payments of our property insurance 
the debt obligation is being repaid in nine monthly installments of million that began in july and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   million was outstanding 
in addition  as of december   million of other debt was outstanding 
statements of cash flows the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands for the years ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by continuing operations cash flows provided by used in discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash balances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash in results from cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million  debt repayments of million  purchases of stock of million  and cash dividend payments of million 
in addition  million of cash was spun off with financing 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the decrease of million is primarily attributable to million of lower income from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by million favorable effect from changes in current assets and liabilities  primarily resulting from a favorable change in receivables 
cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in cash flows used in investing activities in were almost entirely related to million of capital expenditures 
significant cash flows used in investing activities in included million for capital expenditures and million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of taft 
cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million of cash flows provided by financing activities in cash used in included million of debt repayments  million of stock purchased under the stock repurchase program  million of cash spun off to financing and million of dividends 
cash flows provided by financing activities in included proceeds from debt issuance of million and proceeds from a stock offering of million  partially offset by debt repayments of million  purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program of million and dividends paid of million 
capital expenditures totaled million in related principally to the mine no 
east expansion project and other mine development activities at underground mining 
capital expenditures for are expected to total approximately million 
current expectations include approximately million of maintenance capital for all of our segments 
an additional million is projected for the initial development of the million tons of reserves acquired at mine no 
in the remainder includes various expenditures primarily for replacement shields at underground mining and oven wall repairs at walter coke 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
contractual obligations are those that will require cash payments in accordance with the terms of a contract  such as a borrowing or lease agreement 
commercial commitments represent potential obligations for performance in the event of demands by third parties or other contingent events  such as lines of credit or guarantees of debt 
the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  this table does not include interest payable on these obligations 
in  we paid approximately million of interest on the term loan  revolver and other debt financings 
in  we estimate total cash interest payments related to these obligations will be approximately the same as that paid in contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period in thousands total thereafter walter term loan other debt operating leases long term purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations other long term liabilities total cash obligations primarily includes equipment financing  capital leases and a one year property insurance financing agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
subsequent to december   we signed a year  non cancellable lease agreement for  square feet of space for our new headquarters location in the rent on this space ranges from million to million per year 
this obligation is not included in the table above 
represents minimum maintenance payments due for assets under capital lease 
other long term liabilities include pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities 
while the estimated total liability is actuarially determined  there are no definitive payments by period  as pension contributions depend on government mandated minimum funding requirements and other post retirement benefits are paid as incurred 
accordingly  amounts by period included in this schedule are estimates and primarily include estimated post retirement benefits 
the timing of cash outflows related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and the interest thereon  as established pursuant to asc topic  income taxes  cannot be estimated and  therefore  has not been included in the table 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental  miscellaneous litigation and other commitments and contingencies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of these matters not included in the tables above due to their contingent nature 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents net sales and revenues and operating income by reportable segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates are based upon management s historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
inventory valuation the valuation of coal inventories are subject to estimates due to possible gains or losses resulting from inventory movements from the mine site to storage facilities at the port of mobile  inherent inaccuracies in belt scales and aerial surveys used to measure quantities and due to fluctuations in moisture content 
adjustments to coal tonnages on hand are made for an estimate of coal shortages due to these inherent losses  primarily based on historical findings  the results of aerial surveys and periodic coal pile clean ups 
during the four years ended december   results of aerial surveys have indicated that perpetual records require adjustments ranging from to of the ending inventory tonnage balance 
as a result of these historical results  we have recognized a reduction to the ending coal inventory at december  in the amount of million  or of the ending balance  as the estimate of the probable valuation inaccuracy inherent in the inventory balance 
a gain or loss of the inventory balance at december  potentially resulting from these inherent inaccuracies in the measurement processes would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  to income of approximately million 
employee benefits we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions used in developing the required estimates including the following key factors discount rate salary growth retirement rates mortality rates healthcare cost trends expected return on plan assets pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase december  pre post pre post assumed health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rate assumed for next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the discount rate used to determine pension and other post retirement expense is for both and the rate of return on plan assets used to determine pension expense is for both and the discount rate is based on a yield curve approach which discounts each projected benefit obligation based cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective liability stream cash flow 
the model sums the present values of all of the cash flows and then calculates the equivalent weighted average discount rate by imputing the single interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in the rate for each of these assumptions would have the following effects as of and for the year ended december  in thousands increase decrease percentage point increase percentage point decrease healthcare cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense we also have significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities  and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims  discount factors  benefit increases and mortality rates 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience  changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
for the workers compensation liability  we apply a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the us require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
no valuation allowance has been established against our net deferred tax asset because we believe that the entire deferred tax asset will be realized during the allowed statutory carryforward period 
in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  we considered various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in this evaluation  we may need to record a charge to earnings to reflect the change in our expected valuation of the net deferred tax asset 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues primarily related to the discontinued homebuilding and financing businesses 
we believe that our tax filing positions have substantial merit and we intend to vigorously defend these positions 
we have established accruals that we believe are sufficient to address claims related to our uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
assumptions made in the evaluation of impairment testing can have a significant effect on financial results 
as discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired taft in september a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to the mineral interests  valued at million 
the value of the mineral interests was based  in part  on the market price of similar coals at the date of acquisition and the forecasts that existed as of that date 
subsequent to the acquisition  the market price and future forecasted market prices for similar coal dropped significantly  triggering a need for an impairment test of the mineral interests 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of the mineral interests were significantly below the carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter 
the estimated fair value of the mineral interests used in the impairment testing was extremely sensitive to the estimated market price of similar coals 
for example  a increase or decrease in the market pricing used as of the date of the impairment testing of this asset would have increased or decreased  respectively  the estimated fair value by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb amended its guidance in asc topic extractive activities oil and gas  expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons from oil sands  shale and coalbeds  clarifying that entities equity method investments must be considered in oil and gas activities  and requiring new disclosures 
this updated guidance is generally effective for annual periods ending on or after december   but for entities becoming subject to this standard because of the change in the definition of significant oil and gas producing activities  disclosure is required for periods beginning after december  since we are subject to this guidance because we extract hydrocarbons from coalbeds  disclosures under asc topic will be provided for our reporting period  as required 
we do not expect the effect of applying the amendment to have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition 
market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk and commodity risks 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the interest rates on third party indebtedness 
as described more fully under the caption liquidity and capital resources  above  we have the following financial instruments that inherently expose us to interest rate risk the walter credit agreement  an equipment financing arrangement  a capital lease for certain mining equipment and an insurance premium financing arrangement 
in addition  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have entered into an interest rate hedge agreement to convert our equipment financing from a floating rate of interest to a fixed rate of interest 
a ten percent decrease in interest rates from the december  and rates would result in an increase to annual pre tax income from these financial instruments of approximately million and million  respectively  while a ten percent increase in rates would decrease annual pre tax income approximately million and million  respectively 
commodity risks we are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of natural gas 
on an annual basis  our sales of natural gas approximates to million mmbtus equivalent of to billion cubic feet 
we occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing natural gas prices 
such derivative instruments are structured as cash flow hedges and not for trading 
during and  we hedged approximately and  respectively  of our natural gas sales with swap contracts 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
these swap contracts resulted in million of cash inflows in and million of cash outflows in  impacting net sales and revenues 
at december   swap contracts to hedge approximately million mmbtus of anticipated natural gas sales in and  at december   swap contracts to hedge approximately million mmbtus of anticipated natural gas sales in were outstanding as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a ten percent favorable or unfavorable change in the natural gas prices would not have a material effect in the fair value of the swap contracts outstanding at december  and unaudited interim financial information in thousands  except per share amounts quarter ended fiscal year march june september december net sales and revenues income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income diluted income loss per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income quarter ended fiscal year march june september december net sales and revenues income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income diluted income loss per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income amounts vary from previous form q disclosures as a result of classifying kodiak  financing and homebuilding as discontinued operations 
the sum of quarterly eps amounts may be different than annual amounts as a result of the impact of variations in shares outstanding 
fourth quarter results from discontinued operations includes a tax benefit of million related to the deemed liquidation of homebuilding for tax purposes
