overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges  including leased barges  and million barrels of capacity as of december  the company operated an average of towing vessels during  of which an average of were chartered 
the company uses the united states inland waterway system to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
the company also owns and operates four ocean going barge and tug units transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastwise trade 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
for  net earnings attributable to kirby were  or per share  on revenues of  compared with net earnings attributable to kirby of  or per share  on revenues of  the performance reflected lower demand in both its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments  driven by the united states and global economic recession 
the decline in volumes in all four marine transportation markets resulted in lower tank barge utilization levels industry wide that led to increased downward pressure on term contract and spot contract pricing throughout the diesel engine services marine and railroad markets service levels and direct parts sales were below levels due to weak marine transportation  offshore oil services and railroad markets  that resulted in deferred maintenance on customers idled equipment 
results for were negatively impacted by two major gulf coast hurricanes  gustav on september and ike on september hurricane gustav disrupted marine transportation and diesel engine services operations in louisiana for several days 
hurricane ike struck houston galveston  significantly affecting the petrochemical and refining facilities in the path of the storm 
the results included an estimated 
per share negative impact from hurricanes gustav and ike 
as a result of the lower demand in both the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments  the company took specific steps to reduce overhead and lower expenditures during the first and fourth quarters and first quarter 
during the first quarter  the shore staffs of the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments were reduced by approximately through early retirement incentives and staff reductions and this resulted in a charge of  before taxes  or 
per share 
this staff reduction is expected to achieve an annual savings of approximately  a charge of  before taxes  or 
per share  was taken in the fourth quarter and an estimated charge of  before taxes  or 
per share will be taken in the first quarter for additional shore staff reductions 
the fourth quarter and first quarter charges will result in an additional reduction of in the shore staffs of the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
this is expected to result in an annual savings of approximately  as of january   the shore staffs of the marine transportation segment  including shore tankering services  and the diesel engine services segment were down compared with the company s peak headcount in october due to early retirement incentives  staff reductions and employee attrition 
employee attrition since october is expected to result in an annual savings of approximately  the marine transportation segment operated an average of towboats during compared with an average of during as demand softened during the fourth quarter and throughout  the company 
table of contents released chartered towboats and laid up company owned towboats in an effort to balance horsepower needs with current requirements 
going forward  the company will continue to monitor towboat requirements and downsize or increase the towboat fleet as market changes warrant 
marine transportation for  of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the united states 
products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the united states economy and volumes produced by the company s customer base  enhanced by the inherent efficiencies of barge transportation which is generally the lowest cost mode of surface transportation

term contract and spot contract pricing declined throughout as overall industry demand declined 
favorable operating conditions during offset to some degree the impact of the lower demand  but also drove down barge utilization due to faster trip times 
in addition  lower diesel fuel prices resulted in lower revenues associated with the pass through of diesel fuel to customers through fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in term contracts when compared with during the second and third quarters  petrochemical demand of more finished products into the midwest improved modestly and demand along the gulf coast stabilized when compared with the first quarter 
black oil products and refined products demand stabilized during the third quarter  but remained well below prior year levels 
fourth quarter demand levels in the petrochemical  black oil products and refined products were slightly weaker when compared with the third quarter 
agricultural chemical demand was weak throughout due to high midwest inventory levels 
during  approximately of the marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
with the decline in industry wide demand  excess equipment throughout the industry was moved into the spot market  placing downward pressure on spot contract pricing  as well as on contract renewals 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented approximately of marine transportation revenues 
table of contents under term contracts during and rates on term contracts  net of fuel  renewed during the first quarter were generally renewed at existing rates and in some cases rates were traded for longer terms  while second  third and fourth quarter contract renewals declined in the zero to  to and to range  respectively  when compared with the corresponding quarters of spot contract rates for  which include the cost of fuel  decreased an average of to in the first quarter  to in second quarter  to in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter when compared with the corresponding quarters of in  the company estimates that approximately to of the spot contract rate decreases were fuel related 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to  excluding fuel 
the marine transportation operating margin for was compared with for  reflecting lower fuel costs  lower shoreside headcount  reduction of towboats operated  reduced maintenance on laid up equipment  ongoing cost reduction initiatives  more efficient operations at lower utilization levels and more favorable operating conditions  partially offset by the marine transportation s portion of the first and fourth quarters early retirement and staff reduction charges of  the operating margin included the loss of revenue and additional operating expenses associated with hurricanes gustav and ike 
diesel engine services during  of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated through service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the industries it serves 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market revenue markets serviced distribution customers marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial diesel engine services revenue and operating income for decreased and  respectively  compared with demand levels for service and direct parts sales across all segments of the inland and offshore marine markets and offshore oil services markets remained weak as customers deferred maintenance on equipment in response to the economic slowdown 
the medium speed railroad parts and service market was also weak as industrial and shortline railroad customers deferred maintenance in response to lower railroad traffic 
the medium speed power generation market benefited from favorable service and parts sales in the first half but revenues declined in the second half 
the results were negatively impacted by hurricane gustav  as noted above  which resulted in the closure of the segment s facilities for several days  as well as customers facilities and operations 
the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for was compared with for the lower operating margin for reflected lower service levels and direct parts sales and resulting lower labor utilization 
the first and fourth quarters charges for early retirements and staff reductions of  also lowered the operating margin 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during with net cash provided by operating activities of  compared with net cash provided by operating activities for of  the increase was aided by a decline in accounts receivable caused by lower business activity levels during in addition during  the company generated cash of  from the exercise of stock options and  from proceeds from the disposition of assets 
during  cash and borrowings under the 
table of contents company s revolving credit facility were used for capital expenditures of  including  for new tank barge and towboat construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to the increase in equity from net earnings attributable to kirby for of  the exercise of stock options  issuance of restricted stock and lower outstanding debt 
as of december   the company had no outstanding balance under its  revolving credit facility and had  of cash and cash equivalents 
during  the company took delivery of new barges and seven new chartered barges with a total capacity of  barrels  and four horsepower towboats 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
for  new construction commitments from and orders include six barges with a total capacity of  barrels and three horsepower towboats 
new construction for will also include barges  with a total capacity of  barrels  ordered in late for delivery throughout the company s strong cash flow and unutilized loan facilities position the company to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
the marine transportation segment s external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent inland tank barge operators and captive fleet owners seeking to outsource tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size through external growth opportunities would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargoes  less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power and minimal incremental administrative staff 
the diesel engine services segment s external growth opportunities include further consolidation of strategically located diesel service providers  and expanded service capability for other engine and marine gear related products 
as a result of the global recession  petrochemical and refining production during was well below levels 
petrochemical demand of more finished products into the midwest improved modestly as the year progressed and demand along the gulf coast stabilized when compared with the first half  however  the united states economy will have to start expanding before the company sees any significant improvement in demand 
during the first nine months of  of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts 
during the fourth quarter  the term contract portion of marine transportation revenues declined to as certain customers switched to spot contracts when their term contracts expired 
based on current market conditions  the company anticipates that term contracts will continue to be renewed during at lower rates until utilization improves 
spot contract rates for will be driven by volumes and equipment utilization 
the company believes that during and  some incremental capacity was likely added to the industry fleet and that the current reduction of petrochemical and refining production has resulted in excess barge capacity and lower utilization 
during  the company retired older tank barges 
with the weak market conditions  the age of the industry fleet and the high cost of maintaining older barges  industry tank barge capacity may decline in as fewer new barges are anticipated to be built and the retirement of older barges may be accelerated 
the company anticipates that the diesel engine services segment may see some improvement in  as the segment likely reached the bottom of its business cycle in late critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  the current united states and global recession could impact the collectability of certain customers trade receivables which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 
acquisitions on june   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of lake charles diesel for  in cash

the lower demand levels in all four marine transportation markets resulted in lower tank barge utilization levels industry wide that led to increased downward pressure on term contract and spot contract pricing over the last nine months of in addition  approximately of the decrease in marine transportation revenues in compared with was due to negative term contract diesel fuel price escalation adjustments associated with the pass through of diesel fuel to customers through fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in term contracts 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenue for during  petrochemical transportation demand was soft  driven by the deteriorating economic environment  with demand levels well below levels 
movements of more finished petrochemical products to the midwest improved modestly during the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth quarters  when significant destocking of inventories occurred

fourth quarter demand levels in the petrochemical  black oil products and refined products markets were slightly weaker when compared with the third quarter 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was weak throughout the year due to high midwest inventory levels  fueled by heavy rain events which reduced the farmer s ability to apply fertilizer 
for  the marine transportation segment incurred  delay days  less than delay days of  delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more tank barges during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather  lock conditions and other navigational factors 
the delay days reflected milder winter weather conditions and more normal water levels compared with that experienced ice and high water conditions in the midwest throughout the first quarter  high water conditions throughout the mississippi river system during the majority of the second quarter and hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter 
the lower delay days led to a reduction of operating expenses compared with and helped offset some of the financial impact of the lower demand levels

demand for the upriver movements of petrochemicals weakened during the fourth quarter 
the third quarter was negatively impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  more fully described above 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenue for during the first nine months of  the demand for the movement of petrochemical products remained strong  with term contract customers continuing to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates until the september hurricanes  resulting in high tank barge utilization 
with the deteriorating economic environment during the fourth quarter  petrochemical customers responded with numerous plant closures and volume reductions in order to reduce inventories  thereby reducing upriver movements of more finished petrochemical products to the end users 
the black oil products market contributed of marine transportation revenue reflecting relatively strong demand throughout refined petroleum products contributed of marine transportation revenue  experiencing softness in the movement of products from the gulf coast to the midwest  driven by higher gasoline prices and resulting lower gasoline demand  but benefiting from more gulf intracoastal waterway movements 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was unseasonably strong during the first quarter in advance of the traditional spring planting season  remained strong during the first two months of the second quarter until upper mississippi river flooding in june and july curtailed the traditional spring planting season
