executive summary we offer a range of products and services through our alot division 
alot offers toolbar  homepage  and desktop applications  which are marketed under the alot brand 
our customizable alot homepage  desktop and toolbar products are designed to make the internet easy for consumers by providing direct access to affinity content and search results 
these products during the fourth quarter of generated an average of approximately million internet searches per day 
on march   we sold certain assets relating to our miva media division 
following the sale  we no longer operate the miva media business and as a result these operations are presented as discontinued for all periods presented see gain on sale of discontinued operations below 
our miva media division was an auction based pay per click advertising and publishing network that operated across north america and europe 
organization of information this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative on our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
it includes the following sections results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations use of estimates and critical accounting policies results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue during  we recorded revenue from continuing operation of million  a decrease of approximately from the million recorded in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in revenue rates generated per live user year over year and a smaller live user base during live users are defined as the number of unique toolbar users active on the internet in the last days of each period 
we believe our decline in revenue rates per live user was primarily due to the following reasons i reductions beginning in q in revenue sharing rates and available services from certain advertising partners  ii reductions in the number of revenue generating events on our installed product base  iii reductions in search volume in q and q triggering lower revenue sharing rates in a tiered rate structure  and iv general adverse economic conditions broadly affecting the value of search advertising 
with respect to the size of the live user base  the year started with a base of million 
over the year the alot brand  which was started in  grew from million to million 
however  our legacy brand shrank at a faster rate  going from million at the beginning of the year to million at the end 
thus  we ended the year with a total live user base of million  a reduction of approximately 
in the legacy brand continued to shrink to million but the growth in the alot brand to million matched the decline 
at the end of our live user base of million was slightly better than the million at the end of we believe the growth of the alot brand over would have been better except for reductions in advertising spend for cash conservation purposes 
advertising spend for the year ending december   was million  approximately less than the million spent in over the year the amount of advertising to promote our legacy toolbar brand was lowered and then completely eliminated  thus leaving all the advertising spend to promote only the alot brand 
as noted above  the alot brand increased from million live users at the end of to million live users at the end of the fourth quarter of was the third consecutive quarter where our growth in alot toolbar users was greater than the attrition for our legacy toolbar users 
it should be noted we reduced our advertising spend over the last part of december based on historical experience relating to the effectiveness of such spend during the final weeks of the holiday season 
subsequently  our advertising spend in january was increased and by month s end the number of live users increased to million 
we are continuing to focus on cost effective distribution and retention of our alot branded products with our end users 
in addition to more efficient buying that reduces our advertising cost per acquisition  we have engaged in other on going initiatives to expand distribution and reduce attrition for our alot products that include i diversifying our product line to include new platforms  ii adding widget content to our products to expand the number of categories of end user interest   iii optimizing landing pages for our advertisements  and iv seeking new distribution relationships 
if our effort to improve our live toolbar user base is not successful  it may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
for the year ended december   one customer of our alot division  google  accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we have been named in certain litigation  the outcome of which could directly or indirectly impact the results of our operations 
for additional information regarding pending litigation  refer to part i  item legal proceedings below 
we plan to continue our efforts to invest in our business and seek additional revenue through branded toolbars and other initiatives 
we cannot assure you that any of these efforts will be successful 
cost of services cost of services for continuing operations consists of costs associated with designing and maintaining the technical infrastructure that supports our various services and fees paid to telecommunications carriers for internet connectivity 
costs associated with our technical infrastructure  which supports our various services  include salaries of related technical personnel  depreciation of related computer equipment  co location charges for our network equipment  and software license fees 
cost of services for continuing operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease was related to a reduction in the depreciation charges million caused by the impairment charges taken in the quarter ended december   a reduction in cost of services million that corresponds to the drop in revenue  and reduced it costs million related to a streamlining of operations 
cost of services for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  remained at of revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses for continuing operations in the years ended december  and  were as follows in millions for the year ended december  vs 
marketing  sales  and service general and administrative product development amortization impairment loss on goodwill and other assets restructuring charges legal settlement total operating expenses for continuing operations as a percent of revenue for the years ended december  and were as follows for the year ended december  vs 
marketing  sales  and service general and administrative product development amortization impairment loss on goodwill and other assets restructuring charges legal settlement total marketing  sales  and service marketing  sales  and service expense for continuing operations consists primarily of advertising spend that results in product downloads by our end users and also includes payroll expense and benefits related to individuals within this category 
marketing  sales  and service expense for continuing operations decreased approximately million for the year ended december   to million compared to million for the same period in the year over year decrease is related primarily to a reduction in our internet keyword and display advertising spend million used primarily to attract users of our alot 
com brand and secondarily to a reduction in employee related costs million related to operational streamlining 
the initial decrease in advertising spend was implemented to conserve cash during the first quarter of and that decrease had a suppressing effect on subsequent revenue caused by the drop off in our live user base 
additionally  the lower costs can be partially attributed to our more efficient keyword buying program that reduced the average cost for getting an end user to download our products as our advertising program was restored and our live user base was rebuilt 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for continuing operations consists primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  fees for professional services  costs related to leasing  maintaining  and operating our facilities  travel costs for administrative personnel  insurance  depreciation of property and equipment not related to search serving or product development activities  expenses and fees associated with the reporting and other obligations of a public company  bad debts  and other general and administrative services 
fees for professional services include amounts due to lawyers  auditors  tax advisors  and other professionals in connection with operating our business  litigation  and evaluating and pursuing new opportunities 
general and administrative expenses for continuing operations decreased by million in the year ended december   to million compared to million for the same period in the previous year 
decreases contributing to this variance include rent and office related expense million  consulting services million related to lower legal  accounting  and other consulting costs  reduced other taxes that included a franchise tax refund million  lower salaries  benefits  and other employee expenses  including share based compensation million  and lower insurance expenses million 
these cost reductions were indirectly related to our sale of our miva media assets in march  and the reductions are expected to continue into the amount of leased space we required was significantly reduced and we sublet a portion of our space to the buyer of our assets in march for the most part  our office related expenses and share based compensation are directly related to the number of people that we employ  and that number was significantly reduced in the smaller size and less complex structure of our continuing operations had the effect of reducing costs for legal  accounting  and other consulting fees  as well as insurance costs 
currently there are no plans for an employee expansion in no significant changes to the size and complexity of our business are planned in product development product development expense consists primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel responsible for the development and maintenance of features  enhancements  and functionality for our proprietary services  and depreciation for related equipment used in these activities 
product development expenses decreased by million in the year ended december   to million compared to million for the same period in the previous year due primarily to reduced employee related costs from streamlining operations 
in  we expect the product development program to operate at a level comparable to amortization amortization expense is primarily related to the amortization of capitalized software costs 
amortization expense decreased by from million in to million in these decreases were attributed to an overall reduction in our intangible asset base eligible for amortization  primarily as a result of the recorded impairment losses in impairment loss we did not record an impairment loss in  compared to a million impairment loss recorded for the same period in the impairment recognized in reduced the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to zero 
litigation settlement in  we settled with the former shareholders of comet systems  inc for a net amount of million related to a dispute regarding the calculation of a contingent payment due for a company that was acquired in non operating income we recorded other income of million related to the sale of one of our patents to a third party during the gain from the sale recorded in other income included the proceeds from the patent sale less the fees and direct costs related to the sale 
interest income expense net we had net interest expense of approximately million in compared to the net interest income of million in the prior year 
the net interest expense for both years relates to interest for our capital lease obligations and our bridge bank secured line of credit 
in the prior year we earned net interest income through our cash and cash equivalent balances and had only entered our capital lease obligations and our secured line of credit with bridge bank after september exchange loss we incurred an exchange loss of approximately million in compared to no loss or gain recognized in we discontinued european operations when we sold our operating assets to adknowledge in march however  we retained certain financial assets and liabilities that were contained within the related vertro owned european legal entities whose liquidation is expected to occur in given this post sale structure  the us dollar became the functional currency for the eu entities causing us to record exchange rate changes in our consolidated statement of operations 
most of the exchange rate loss relates to the outstanding intercompany loans between the eu subsidiaries and our us parent corporation that previous to the miva media sale were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in anticipation of final liquidation of the eu legal entities  similar exchange rate losses or possible exchange rate gains could occur in should the relationship between the us dollar and european currencies change 
gain on sale of discontinued operations on march   with the exception of certain retained assets and liabilities  including assets and liabilities of the miva media division in france  we sold the assets  net of liabilities assumed  of our miva media business for cash consideration of approximately million less post closing adjustments of approximately million  plus the assumption of a software license of million  which resulted in a gain on sale of approximately million during we incurred approximately million of legal and financial advisory fees in connection with the sale of the miva media division  which are included in the net gain on sale 
our decision to divest our miva media business was due primarily to inconsistencies between the division s products and services and our current strategic plan 
loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the same period in the previous year 
these losses in included approximately a million in miva media operating losses incurred up to the date of sale on march  plus wind down costs incurred for the remainder of the year  restructuring charges of approximately million primarily related to severance expense resulting from the termination of our senior vice president of miva media  and exchange losses of approximately million 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended  includes approximately million in losses from miva media operations  million for an impairment loss from the writedown of our goodwill  million for restructuring charges  and million for exchange losses  which was partially offset by million related to a tax benefit and interest income 
there is an estimated corresponding consolidated tax loss on this transaction  the difference in the book gain and tax loss is estimated to be approximately million and is predominately related to basis differences in goodwill  which was impaired at december   for book purposes  other intangible assets also impaired at december   and fixed assets  all of which we had tax basis in excess of book basis 
as a result of the miva media sale we have terminated eu centered operations and all operations are now centered in the us as a result  the us dollar subsequently became the functional currency for all operations 
effective april   we are recording all current foreign currency translation adjustments in income loss from continuing operations 
the balance of foreign currency translation adjustments accumulated through the date of sale  will be reflected in discontinued operations when the retained assets of the foreign subsidiaries are substantially liquidated 
income taxes for the years ended december  and  we recorded the following loss from continuing operations before the tax provision benefit in thousands except percentages provision benefit for taxes loss before provision for income taxes effective tax rates the primary reasons for the relationship of income taxes to pretax losses in and are the non deductibility of the goodwill and other indefinite lived asset portions of the impairment charges of million in continuing operations  our inability to recognize the tax benefits of losses carried forward to future years  and the geographic distribution of profits and losses in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
the tax benefit recorded in results from a federal tax receivable of thousand originating from the carry back of a net operating loss that became available in due to changes in tax carryback regulations  net of the additional interest of thousand accrued in related to our liability for uncertain tax positions 
as a result of the geographic distribution of the loss from discontinued operations and of the gain on sale of discontinued operations in the applicable jurisdictions  no income tax provision or benefit is allocable to discontinued operations for in  a benefit of thousand has been allocated to the loss from discontinued operations resulting from the release of certain estimated tax liabilities of thousand which were determined during to no longer be payable  offset by state tax expenses of thousand in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  loss carry forwards  and tax credit carry forwards for which income tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we have recorded million in deferred tax assets  offset by valuation allowances of million  and deferred tax liabilities of million 
included in deferred tax assets at december   is million related to the tax benefits of net operating loss nol carry forwards 
the nol carry forwards include million gross federal nol in the united states of which million in losses is restricted to annual usage of million pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
any amounts not used may be carried forward to the following year  however  the annual limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of the affected nols before they are utilized 
the balance of the us nol was generated as a result of operations from to  and is not limited in usage 
we have uk nol carry forwards of million 
as of december   the deferred tax assets from all remaining nols are fully offset by valuation allowances or deferred tax liabilities 
per the adoption of new accounting guidance for business combinations on january   subsequent releases  if any  of valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carry forwards at the time of acquisition will be recorded as a reduction of the income tax provision 
net loss as a result of the factors described above  we generated a net loss from continuing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  was and  respectively 
weighted average common shares used in the earnings per share computation increased million shares from million shares for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to shares issued upon the vesting of restricted stock units 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a total unrestricted cash of million 
this represents a million or decrease from the total cash of million at december  the decrease in cash was primarily due to payouts related to the june and august restructuring initiatives  expenses associated with perot  our outsourcing partner  repayment to bridge bank of our outstanding line of credit and operating expenses in excess of revenue in the year ending december   offset by the cash received in the sale of the media business on march  cash flow from continuing operations has improved steadily since march   the date of our asset sale 
by that date  our live user base suffered significant deterioration as a direct result of our decision to lower ad spend in order to conserve cash 
the reduced advertising spend  which is used to obtain new live users to download our products and services resulted in lower revenue 
subsequent to the sale  and as we forecasted  it took the rest of the year to scale up our live user base to a point that could generate sustainable margins 
we went from negative cash flow from continuing operations in the second and third quarters to positive cash flow in the fourth quarter 
we expect this fourth quarter trend to continue as our restored live user base continues to scale and at a lower cost per acquisition 
operating activities net cash used in operations totaled million in the year ended december  cash flow from operations can be understood by starting with the amount of net income or loss and adjusting that amount for non cash items and variations in the timing between revenue recorded and revenue collected and between expenses recorded and expenses paid 
the net loss million included non cash items of  depreciation and amortization million  write off the deferred finance costs million  compensation expense based on equity grants rather than cash million  offset by gains on the sale of one of our patents million and the gain on sale of business million 
thus  the cash used in operations before the effect of timing differences was million 
with respect to revenue  the amount collected was more than the amount recorded million decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by the increase in the income taxes receivable million 
with respect to expenses  the amount paid was more than the amount recorded by million 
net cash used in operations totaled million in the year ended december  the net loss million included non cash items of an impairment for goodwill and other assets million  bad debt provision related to doubtful accounts million  depreciation and amortization million  and compensation expense based on equity grants rather than cash million 
thus  the cash used in operations before the effect of timing differences was million 
with respect to revenue  the amount collected was more than the amount recorded million decrease in accounts receivable but offset by a decrease in the revenue collected but deferred to the future million decrease in deferred revenue 
with respect to expenses  the amount paid was more than the amount recorded by million  payments on accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities were higher than the related amount of expenses million  but were offset by the decrease in prepaid expenses and other items million 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  cash was provided by the net proceeds from the sale of the miva media business million  net proceeds from the sale of a patent million  and cash released from restriction million as collateral for the secured line of credit agreement with bridge bank 
offsetting these sources was cash restricted to secure the credit limit for credit cards issued to us by bridge bank million and the purchase of capital items million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  this use of cash was for the purchase of capital assets  including internally developed software 
we were also required to provide a restricted cash balance of million under our loan agreement with bridge bank 
at december   our existing infrastructure used to support the development and delivery of our products and services is more than adequate for the foreseeable future 
therefore the cash investment requirement is expected to be limited 
additionally  we continuously review our strategy in an effort to enhance or refine our business model 
from time to time  we consider mergers and acquisitions that could require the use of cash or divesting non core assets that alternatively could raise cash 
currently  there are no immediate plans to engage in merger  acquisition  or divesture activity 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  this use of cash consisted of a one time payment to pay off the secured line of credit agreement with bridge bank million and cash used to pay the quarterly payments on the capital lease obligations million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  we received proceeds of under our loan agreement with bridge bank 
offsetting thee proceeds  we used cash of approximately million for payments on our capital lease obligations for the software and hardware related to our transformation project and approximately million in fees associated with the loan from bridge bank 
we also incurred non cash financing of approximately million related to our two capital lease obligations 
liquidity we currently anticipate that our working capital of approximately million  including unrestricted cash of approximately million as of december   along with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our expected liquidity needs for working capital and capital expenditures over at least the next months 
our working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets on our balance sheet 
our forecast for future liquidity and capital requirements is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to monetize our products  our ability to retain our most significant customer  our ability to distribute our products  our ability to execute on our business plans  and our ability to meet financial forecasts 
based on the progressive improvements we achieved throughout  the positive results in the fourth quarter of  and the continuing positive trend so far in  we expect to show positive liquidity throughout nevertheless  in the future  we may seek additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity to fund working capital  expansion of our business and or acquisitions  or to capitalize on market conditions 
as we require additional capital resources  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or draw down cash under our loan agreement 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors or that  if our expectations are not met  we will have sufficient capital resources to meet our obligations 
in the ordinary course of business  we have provided indemnifications of varying scope and terms to advertisers  advertising agencies  distribution partners  vendors  lessors  business partners  and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements including our recently executed miva media sale  services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
we may have future liabilities for some of these miva media related indemnifications even though we have sold that division 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we also have agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors  and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors  officers  and employees of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
at this time  it is not possible to determine any potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
if a need arises to fund any of these indemnifications  it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary materially as a result of the factors described above and in the section included in part i  item a  titled risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations operating leases our primary administrative  sales  customer service  and technical facilities are in a leased office facility in new york  new york 
our new york office is approximately  square feet and the lease expires in january we also lease approximately  square feet in fort myers  florida  that served primarily as our headquarters and operations center for miva media and the lease will expire in november we sublease portions of our fort myers facility as set forth below 
sublease income in march  in conjunction with the miva media sale  we licensed one floor in our office located in fort myers  florida approximately  square feet to the buyer with the intent to convert into a sublease agreement upon receipt of landlord consent 
the term of the license agreement commenced on march   and it is expected to end on november  the sublease payments are expected to be received over this term 
from august until december  we had entered into a real estate sublease agreement with an unrelated party to sublease approximately  square feet of our office located in fort myers  florida 
in december  the lease was amended whereby the landlord entered into a direct lease arrangement with vertro s sublessor thereby relieving vertro of any further contractual obligation for this space 
in february vertro  through its then searchfeed subsidiary  entered into a lease for office space in bridgewater  nj with an expiration date of february in december  a sublease was executed between vertro and an unrelated party for the remaining life of the lease 
the sublease payments are expected to be received over this term 
guaranteed royalty payments we have minimum contractual payments as part of our royalty bearing non exclusive license to certain yahoo patents that were used in our miva media operations  that are payable quarterly through august in addition  we have ongoing royalty payments based on our use of those patents 
we are not currently using these patents in our operations 
our rights and minimum payment obligations under this agreement were not assigned to or assumed by adknowledge as part of the miva media sale 
therefore  since we would no longer be operating the miva media business after the date of sale  the remaining minimum payments of approximately million due by us under the agreement were accrued as of the date of the miva media sale  and are included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  at december   million of minimum payments remain outstanding the following table illustrates the above contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period in thousands due in due in due in more than total years operating leases sublease income guaranteed royalty payments total use of estimates and critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on our balance sheets and income statements  and our related disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in order to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily ascertained from other sources 
different results would be obtained if alternative assumptions or conditions are used and actual results will differ from these estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue when an alot user clicks on a sponsored advertisement which is routed to a distribution partner s network  revenues and related profit are recognized in the amount of alot s share of the partner s fee 
non click through related revenue from alot resulting from a variety of search related applications is recognized when earned under the terms of the contractual arrangement with the advertiser or advertising agency  provided that collection is probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payments by our billable customers and partners 
our allowance for bad debt must be considered from both a continuing and discontinued operational perspective 
a relatively small allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded for continuing operations since there is minimal delinquency for all the customer accounts 
the discontinued operations allowance for the year ending december   primarily relates to all of the eu trade receivables that were considered uncollectible and resulted in a full allowance against these receivables at the date of the miva media sale 
with the sale of the miva media in march  we retained only the eu receivable accounts and their related allowance 
subsequent to the sale  we were able to collect a portion of those receivables 
we will continue our eu collection efforts until the legal entities are liquidated 
the total allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  of which million and million related to the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with continuing operations 
the following table illustrates the related bad debt expense recovery as a percentage of revenues from continuing operations for and in thousands  except percentages revenues from continuning operations bad debt recovery from continuing operations bad debt recovery as a percent of revenue bad debt recovery expense discontinued operations the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate calculated based on an analysis of current business and economic risks  customer credit worthiness  specific identifiable risks such as bankruptcies  terminations  or discontinued customers  or other factors that may indicate a potential loss 
the allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to provide for all reasonably expected losses in the receivable balances and an expense is recorded using a reserve rate based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable or when it is probable that a certain receivable will not be collected 
an account may be determined to be uncollectible if all collection efforts have been exhausted  the customer has filed for bankruptcy and all recourse against the account is exhausted  or disputes are unresolved and negotiations to settle are exhausted 
this uncollectible amount is written off against the allowance 
if our billable customers ability to pay our invoices were to suffer  resulting in the likelihood that we would not be paid for services rendered  additional allowances may be necessary  which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
historically  our actual results have been consistent with these allowances 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statement of income and cash flows 
based on the results of our continuing operations for the year ended december   a point basis deviation from our estimates would have had a minimal effect on operating income 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  loss carry forwards  and tax credit carry forwards for which income tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of such deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering the available positive and negative evidence 
this also requires us to make estimates of our future taxable results by taxable jurisdiction and to evaluate tax planning strategies 
as of december   we have deferred tax assets of million offset by valuation allowances of million  and deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
at december   we had a united states net operating loss nol carry forward of million  of which million can currently be used at an annual rate of million pursuant to internal revenue code section the balance of the us nol was generated as a result of current operations from to  and is not expected to be limited in usage 
we have uk nol carry forwards of million 
as of december   the deferred tax assets from all remaining nols are fully offset by valuation allowances or deferred tax liabilities 
upon the adoption of new accounting guidance for business combinations on january   subsequent releases  if any  of valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carry forwards at the time of acquisition will be recorded as a reductions of the income tax provision 
the following table illustrates the effective total tax rates for and for continuing operations in thousands  except percentages provision benefit for taxes loss before provision for income taxes effective tax rates impairment evaluations we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  including property  plant  and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we perform indefinite lived impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances  if necessary 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets  or the strategy for the overall business  significant decrease in the market value of the assets  declines in our market capitalization below our book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the indicators  the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
goodwill  other indefinite lived intangible asset  and other long lived asset impairment assessments are generally determined based on fair value techniques  including determining the estimated future discounted and undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures  and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  and industry data 
discounted cash flows are calculated using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
determining the fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we might be required to record impairment charges for the assets 
as disclosed in note d to our consolidated financial statements  impairment of goodwill  other intangibles  and long lived assets  we recorded total goodwill and other tangible asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of this amount consists of million of goodwill impairment charges  million of other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment  and million of long lived asset impairment 
of the total  million related to and is classified in discontinued operations 
as of december   we have no remaining recorded goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets 
share based compensation share based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by option pricing models and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements  accounting for share based compensation  for a further discussion of share based compensation 
legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits and other claims related to our business and operations 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and might revise our estimates 
the lawsuits against us could result in material losses for us  both as a result of paying legal defense costs and any damages that may result if we are unsuccessful in our defense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk as a result of the sale of the miva media  we have terminated eu centered operations 
however  as part of the sale  certain assets and liabilities were retained by us  and these items will continue to be subject to foreign currency risk until the eu legal entities can be liquidated 
our international operations are subject to risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states

these intercompany accounts were typically denominated in the functional currency of the international subsidiary
