we believe we can satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months with continuous reliance on related party debt financing 
however  completion of our plan of operation is subject to attaining adequate revenue 
we cannot assure investors that adequate revenues will be generated 
in the absence of our projected revenues  we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations 
even without adequate revenues within the next twelve months  we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities  but we may require financing to potentially achieve our profit  revenue  and growth goals 
we anticipate that our operational  and general and administrative expenses for the next months will total approximately  we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any significant equipment 
we also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees 
the foregoing represents our best estimate of our cash needs based on current planning and business conditions 
the exact allocation  purposes and timing of any monies raised in subsequent private financings may vary significantly depending upon the exact amount of funds raised and our progress with the execution of our business plan 
we have several companies in various stages of the acquisition process along with the filing of provisional patents regarding new technology acquired and will commence to market and license these technologies immediately 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies  risk and financial condition 
we believe our use if estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our management believes that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report
