item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mesa laboratories  inc manufactures and distributes electronic measurement systems and disposable products for various niche applications  including renal treatment  food processing  medical sterilization  pharmaceutical processing and other industrial applications 
our company follows a philosophy of manufacturing a high quality product and providing a high level of on going service for those products 
in order to optimize the performance of our company and to build the value of the company for its shareholders  we continually follow the trend of various key financial indicators 
a sample of some of the most important of these indicators is presented in the following table 
key financial indicators cash and investments trade receivables days sales outstanding inventory net inventory turns working capital current ratio average return on stockholder investment assets invested capital net sales gross profit gross margin operating income operating margin net profit net profit margin earnings per diluted share capital expenditures net head count sales per employee average return on stockholder investment is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year total stockholder s equity 
average return on invested capital invested capital total assets current liabilities cash and short term investments is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year invested capital 
while we continually try to optimize the overall performance and trends  the table above does highlight various exceptions 
most of the indicators above have declined small amounts in the most recent fiscal year 
a small decrease in net profit margin combined with increasing balance sheet levels during fiscal caused the average return calculations to decrease in the current fiscal year 
our company saw a small decrease in net profit margin in fiscal due to a decrease in gross profit margins and decreased interest income on invested cash due to lower interest rates 
results of operations net sales net sales for fiscal increased two percent from fiscal  and net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal in dollars  net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in  and net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in our revenues come from two main sources  which include product revenues and parts and service revenues 
parts and service revenues are derived from on going repair and recalibration or certification of our products 
the certification or recalibration of product is usually a key component of the customer s own quality system and many of our customers operate in regulated industries  such as food processing or medical and pharmaceutical processing 
for this reason  these revenues tend to be fairly stable and grow slowly over time 
also  it is important to note that the raven products are disposables and thus do not contribute to the company s parts and service revenue 
during fiscal years  and our company had parts and service revenue of   and  as a percentage of total revenue  parts and service revenues were in  in and in the performance of new product sales is dependent on several factors  including general economic conditions in the united states and abroad  capital spending trends  competition and the introduction of new products 
new products released to the market over the past five fiscal years include the xl dialysate meter for kidney dialysis which was introduced late in fiscal  and the datatrace rf system which was introduced in early fiscal for fiscal years  and  product sales for our company were   and during the twelve months of fiscal  sales of the company s medical products and services increased two percent compared to the prior year periods 
for the twelve month period  increases in shipments of meter accessories  standard solutions and parts and service were partially offset by a decrease in meter sales compared to prior year 
sales for the twelve month period saw declines in micropack iii products and service which were partially offset by increased sales of the micropack rf products 
for the fourth quarter  datatrace sales increased percent compared to the same period last year  reducing the sales decrease to seven percent for the twelve month period compared to the same period last year 
during most of fiscal  capital spending was impacted negatively by the recession  but we have seen a recovery during the fourth quarter ended march  as many major customers moved into a new budget year 
during the twelve months of fiscal  sales of raven biological indicator products increased seven percent compared to the prior year period 
the increase in raven sales for the twelve month period was due to increases in sales of disposable biological indicator and chemical indicator products 
most raven sales are made to customers in medical related industries and did not suffer decline as a result of the recession 
sales during fiscal also benefited from increased production capabilities and automation  which is allowing our company to better penetrate the market with additional product size configurations and increased production of key products 
since the acquisition of the torqo bottle cap testing equipment late in december  shipments have totaled  over the same period  orders for the torqo products were just under  like our other capital equipment products  we have seen strong order rates for the torqo products in the quarter ended march   and we expect to see this product line make larger contributions to sales during fiscal during fiscal  sales of the nusonics line of ultrasonic fluid measurement systems decreased percent 
the nusonics products currently contribute less than three percent of the company s total sales and are not expected to grow in the future 
during fiscal  sales of the company s medical products and services increased for the fiscal year compared to the prior year period 
for the year  medical saw increased sales of meter products  disposables and service  which were partially offset by lower sales of the discontinued dialyzer reprocessor 
sales of our new xl meter continued to progress well during fiscal during fiscal  sales of datatrace data logger products performed at the same level as the prior year 
for the year  datatrace products did not experience an increase in sales due to existing economic trends which influenced some industrial customers to delay their capital equipment purchases 
sales for the twelve month period saw small declines though the various categories of micropack iii products which were off set by increased sales of the new micropack rf products 
fiscal sales of raven biological indicator products increased percent compared to the prior year period 
in fiscal  raven experienced an increase in biological indicator and chemical indicator sales 
sales during fiscal benefited from increased production capabilities and automation  which is allowing our company to better penetrate the market with increased production of key products 
during fiscal  sales of the nusonics line of ultrasonic fluid measurement systems increased by three percent compared to prior year 
sales of these products remained stable  but nusonics products currently contribute less than four percent of the company s total sales and are not expected to grow in the future 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales in fiscal increased percentage points from fiscal to percent  and in fiscal increased percentage points from fiscal to percent from percent 
most of our products enjoy gross margins in excess of percent 
due to the fact that the dialysis products have sales concentrated with several companies that maintain large chains of treatment centers  the products that are sold to the renal market tend to be slightly more price sensitive than the data logging products 
also  due to the nature of the market for biological indicators  the raven products produce gross margins lower than datatrace and medical 
therefore  shifts in product mix toward higher sales of datatrace and medical products will tend to produce lower cost of sales expense and higher gross margins while shifts toward higher sales of raven products will normally produce the opposite effect on cost of sales expense and gross margins 
during fiscal  our company saw increases in datatrace cost of sales as a percent of sales due to lower datarace sales 
this has combined with a shift in overall product mix between the datatrace logger and raven biological indicator product lines resulting in a lower gross margin for the overall company 
the acquisition of the torqo products also has had a negative effect on margins due to the use of vibrac  llc to manufacture these products for the first year 
once manufacturing of the torqo products is consolidated at our lakewood  co facility we will expect to see cost of sales decline to less than percent as a percent of sales 
while cost of sales have increased during the year as a percent of sales  these increases are being significantly offset by decreases in our operating expenses 
the company continues to monitor and implement cost reduction programs  price increases and improvements in freight cost recovery 
during fiscal  our company saw an increase in costs of sales due to flat datatrace sales as a result of the economic downturn  and increases in raven and medical products 
the company continued to monitor and implement cost reduction programs  price increases and improvements in freight cost recovery 
selling  general and administrative general and administrative expenses tend to be fairly fixed and stable from year to year 
to the greatest extent possible  we work at containing and minimizing these costs 
total administrative costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  which represents a  increase from fiscal to fiscal and a  increase from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  we saw increases in professional fees related to acquisitions  which were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense 
as we progress into fiscal  we expect to see a significant rise in amortization expense due to the torqo acquisition and the recently completed sgm biotech  inc acquisition 
fiscal general and administrative costs increased due to general increases in operating costs and the addition of a controller position 
our selling and marketing costs tend to be far more variable in relation to sales  although there are various exceptions 
some of these exceptions include the introduction of new products and the mix of international sales to domestic sales 
for a product line experiencing introduction of a new product  costs will tend to be higher as a percent of sales due to higher advertising development and sales training programs 
our company s international sales are usually discounted and recorded at the net discounted price  so that a change in mix between international and domestic sales may influence selling and marketing costs 
one other major influence on selling and marketing costs is the mix of domestic dialysis product sales to all other domestic sales 
domestic dialysis product sales are made by direct telemarketing representatives  which gives us a lower cost structure  when compared to the field salesman and independent representative sales channels utilized by our other products 
through fiscal and fiscal the company continued to focus additional resources on its selling and marketing efforts 
since acquiring the torqo bottle cap testing line we have been incorporating this line of products into our datatrace direct sales channel for domestic sales 
in dollars  selling and marketing costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling cost were percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal during both fiscal and  selling and marketing costs as a percent of sales declined 
fiscal selling and marketing costs declined due to a small decline in head count and a reduction of trade show costs during the fiscal year 
fiscal selling and marketing costs declined as a percent of sales due to sales increasing at a rate slightly higher than the growth of costs 
research and development company sponsored research and development cost was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we are currently executing a strategy of increasing the flow of internally developed products 
late in the first quarter of fiscal  the datatrace micropack rf product was introduced  and on going research to introduce this technology into the environmental monitoring segment of the market has proceeded during fiscal most of our work during fiscal was focused on the development of the new micropack rf products as part of our datatrace line 
net income net income decreased to  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal from  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal  and fiscal increased from  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal during fiscal profitability was impacted chiefly by an increase in cost of sales and a decrease in interest income  which was mostly offset by a decrease on sales and marketing costs and a decrease in income tax expense due to a decrease in state income taxes 
for the fiscal year  mesa experienced net income growth of four percent  which was behind the sales growth rate of percent for the fiscal year 
this lower profitability growth in fiscal  was due to flat datatrace product growth and higher cost of sales liquidity and capital resources on march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  in addition  we had other current assets totaling  and total current assets of  current liabilities of our company were  which resulted in a current ratio of for comparison purposes at march   we had cash and short term investments of  other current assets of  total current assets of  current liabilities of  and a current ratio of on december   mesa announced that it had purchased the assets associated with the bottle cap torque testing products of vibrac  llc 
the instruments acquired by mesa include their original high performance cap testing product  the torqo i  along with the newer torqo ii and the innovative smart bottle 
under the terms of the agreement  mesa agreed to pay approximately  in total  and vibrac has agreed to manufacture these products for a one year period 
currently  the company owes a holdback amount of  to vibrac  llc  which is to be paid in equal installments at june and december due to the timing of the acquisition of these products  they only made a minor contribution to sales and gross profits in the fiscal year 
our company has made capital acquisitions of  in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal included approximately  expended on equipment to automate certain manufacturing processes for our raven products 
we have instituted a program to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
under the plan  the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
shares purchased will be canceled and repurchases will be made with existing cash reserves 
we do not maintain a set policy for our buyback program 
most of our stock buybacks have occurred during periods when the price to earnings multiple has been near historical low points  or during times when selling activity in the stock is out of balance with buying demand 
during fiscal  the company paid regular quarterly dividends of 
per share of common stock during the first two quarters of the year and increased the quarterly dividend rate to 
per share of common stock during the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
total dividends paid during fiscal were 
per share of common stock 
for fiscal year  dividends totaled 
per common share of stock 
our company invests its surplus capital in various interest bearing instruments  including money market funds and short term treasuries 
all investments are fixed dollar investments with variable rates in order to minimize the risk of principal loss 
at the end of fiscal  the company did not maintain a line of credit or any other form of debt 
nor did the company guarantee the debt of any other entity 
the company has maintained a long history of surplus cash flow from operations 
this surplus cash flow has been used in the past to fund acquisitions and stock buybacks and has been partially utilized to fund past special dividends 
on april    the company completed the purchase of sgm biotech  inc located in bozeman  mt 
under the terms of this acquisition the company acquired all of the stock of sgm biotech for a cash payment of  after the completion of the acquisition the company repaid  of loans owed to the shareholders of sgm biotech 
on april   the company also completed the acquisition of the facility that houses the sgm biotech operations for  to finance these acquisitions  the company entered into a credit facility consisting of a month reducing line of credit for  which was fully utilized at april   and a revolving line of credit for  of which  was utilized at april  contractual obligations at march  we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders for routine purchases of supplies and inventory  which would be payable in less than one year 
in addition  the company is liable for payments to vibrac  llc of  of holdback to be paid in two equal payments  june and in december  with accumulated interest at a rate of three percent per annum

factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  include but are not limited to general economic  financial and business conditions  competition in the data logging market  competition in the kidney dialysis market  competition in the fluid measurement market  competition in the biological indicator market  competition in the bottle cap torque testing market  the business abilities and judgment of personnel  the impacts of unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  and changes in business strategy 
we do not intend to update these forward looking statements 
you are advised to review the item a 
risk factors of this report for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of mesa laboratories  inc critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  research and development costs  valuation of inventory  valuation of long lived assets and stock based compensation 
these policies  and the company s procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition we sell our products directly through our sales force and through distributors and manufacturer s representatives 
revenue from direct sales of our product is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
revenue from ongoing product service and repair is fully recognized upon completion and shipment of serviced product 
accounts receivable at the time the accounts are originated  the company considers a reserve for doubtful accounts based on the creditworthiness of the customer 
the provision for uncollectible amounts is continually reviewed and adjusted to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover future losses 
the allowance is management s best estimate of uncollectible amounts and is determined based on historical performance that is tracked by the company on an ongoing basis 
the losses ultimately incurred could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance 
research development costs research and development activities consist primarily of new product development and continuing engineering on existing products 
costs related to research and development efforts on existing or potential products are expensed as incurred 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method fifo to determine cost 
the company s policy is to periodically evaluate the market value of the inventory and the stage of product life cycle  and record a reserve for any inventory considered slow moving or obsolete 
as of march  and  the company had recorded a reserve of  and  each year  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the realizable value of long lived assets for potential impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated fair value is less than its carrying value 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
as of march   we evaluated our long lived assets for potential impairment 
based on our evaluation  no impairment charge was recognized 
stock based compensation the company implemented the provisions of sfas r and now codified as asc effective april  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended march  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to april  and previously granted awards not vested as of april  the company uses the black scholes valuation model to value option grants 
we use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for the estimated life of the option 
the dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend payments made during the prior four quarters as a percent of average stock price for that period 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any viable alternative would not produce a materially different result
