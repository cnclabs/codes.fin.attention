item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for an explanation of forward looking statements 
risks related to our business if we continue to suffer significant losses  it may be difficult to continue in operation 
we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of  in  and  in  for a two year total of  further significant losses will make it difficult for us to continue in operation 
our losses have largely resulted from loan and investment impairments 
during and  we recorded total provisions for loan losses of  and other than temporary losses on investments of  while our losses also included a charge off of goodwill of  and charges to establish an allowance against the realization of our deferred tax asset of  these latter charges would not have been required had we not incurred the losses on loans and investments 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate and consumer loans  which made up the remaining of our loan portfolio 
because the portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans can lead to a significant increase in non performing loans 
increases in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not successfully execute our plan to return to profitability 
we are executing a plan to return to profitability on a long term basis by stabilizing and then reducing our level of non performing assets  enhancing our capital and liquidity  and increasing the operating income of our core community banking franchise 
we are in the process of selling multiple clusters of branches and loans to help us achieve our priorities 
while we expect to reach agreements for these divestiture transactions  they must not materially reduce our liquidity  we must agree on other terms with prospective purchasers and the transactions must be approved by regulators 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing sufficient divestiture transactions that will permit us to reach our regulatory capital targets 
we may not succeed in our efforts to maintain regulatory capital at desired levels 
integra bank has agreed with the occ to develop a plan to increase its total capital ratio to at least and its tier leverage ratio to by march  we plan to increase regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets through divestitures of branch offices and sales of loans 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the decline in the market prices of financial stocks in general  and our stock in particular  since january   could make it more expensive for us to raise capital in the public or private markets 
in many situations  our board of directors has the authority  without any vote of our shareholders  to issue shares of our authorized but unissued securities  including shares of common stock authorized and unissued under our stock option plans or additional shares of preferred stock 
in the future  we may issue additional securities  through public or private offerings  in order to raise additional capital 
any such issuance of common stock at current trading prices would significantly dilute the ownership of our current shareholders because we would have to issue more shares than if we had raised the same amount of capital when our share price was higher 
a decline in our performance could adversely impact our stock price and the level of interest in an equity offering making it more difficult or expensive to attract investors interest 
in the case of a debt offering  it could also result in a higher cost of funds  which could negatively impact our future earnings 
if we are not able to maintain integra bank s regulatory capital at levels that are satisfactory to us and our regulators  our regulators could take additional  more stringent  enforcement actions 
in addition  declines in integra bank s capital levels could impact its ability to access lower cost sources of funding that are currently available  such as public funds and brokered deposits 
future earnings and liquidity may be adversely affected 
failure to comply with both the agreement with the occ and the memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the bank is subject to primary supervision and regulation by the occ  while we are subject to primary supervision and regulation by the federal reserve 
our good standing with regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation of our businesses 
in may  the bank entered into a formal written agreement by which the bank agreed to develop and implement actions to reduce the amount of classified assets and improve earnings 
any material failures to comply with the agreement would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the occ which could damage the reputation of the bank and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in september  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis 
pursuant to the memorandum  we made informal commitments to  among other things  use our financial and management resources to assist the bank in addressing weaknesses identified by the occ  not pay dividends on outstanding shares or interest or other sums on outstanding trust preferred securities and not incur any additional debt 
any material failures to comply with the agreement would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the federal reserve which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net interest income could decline 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is dependent on both the level of our earning assets and interest spread 
the portion of our assets that are non earning have increased significantly in and  reducing our net interest income 
further increases in non earning assets would further reduce net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
this reserve represents our best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in our judgment is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of various factors  including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of regulatory examinations  and current economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and guarantors  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
our non performing assets increased  to  in any further significant increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual provision for was   more than our net charge offs of  our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions and trends 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in southern indiana  southern and central illinois  as well as in the chicago area  western  central and northern kentucky and southwest ohio 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations 
at the time of filing this report  the united states  as well as the global economy  appears to be emerging from a deep and prolonged recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
the current slow economy is evidenced by the continued negative outlook and sentiment  market disruptions  slow growth rates  declines in housing prices  values of commercial real estate  and increases in the consumer price index  in part driven by higher energy and food prices and by employment concerns 
dramatic declines in the housing market since  with lower home prices and increased foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to securities issued by government sponsored entities  credit default swaps and other derivative securities  in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit worthy borrowers or to other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our access to capital 
in particular  we face the following risks in connection with these events further declines in the housing market and the increased volatility of the stock market may adversely affect consumer confidence and may cause adverse changes in loan payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates 
the processes we use to estimate probable losses and impairment of assets  including investment securities  may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
additional losses and declines in financial performance in the banking industry could negatively impact the value of our trust preferred securities portfolio and result in additional other than temporary impairment 
a decline in consumer confidence could also result in withdrawal of deposit funds by consumers  negatively impacting our liquidity 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events 
we may be required to pay higher fdic premiums because of the increased deposit coverage and the closure of other financial institutions could deplete the insurance fund of the fdic 
as each of the above conditions continues to exist or worsen  we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance that recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions will stabilize the united states banking system and the enactment of these initiatives may significantly affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or stock price 
in and continuing through  governments  regulators and central banks in the united states and worldwide have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  however  asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited 
the eesa authorizes the treasury department to  among other things  purchase up to  of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions and their holding companies 
the purpose of eesa is to restore confidence and stability to the united states banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
under the cpp  the treasury department is purchasing equity securities from participating institutions 
for more information regarding our participation in the cpp  see the discussion under the caption participation in capital purchase program in item business of this report 
the eesa also increased federal deposit insurance on most deposit accounts from to this increase is in place until the end of the fdic announced an extension of the transaction account guarantee program  which provides unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts  as well as transaction accounts bearing an interest rate no higher than 
financial institutions may opt out of this program 
we did not opt out and plan to maintain the higher coverage amounts until the expiration date of june  the arra  which was signed into law on february   includes a wide array of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
the failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa and the arra have been followed by numerous actions by the federal reserve  the united states congress  the treasury department  the fdic  the sec and others to address the current liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime mortgage market meltdown that began in these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to stabilize the united states banking system 
the eesa  the arra and the other regulatory initiatives described above may not have their desired effects 
if the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because of our participation in the capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends and repurchase our shares as well as restrictions on compensation paid to our executive officers 
during  we suspended the payment of dividends on the treasury preferred stock 
as a result  we cannot pay dividends on our shares of common stock 
as a participant in the cpp  we must comply with the executive compensation and corporate governance standards imposed by the arra for so long as the treasury department holds any securities acquired from us pursuant to the securities purchase agreement or upon exercise of the warrant  excluding any period during which the treasury department holds only the warrant 
these standards include but are not limited to i ensuring that incentive compensation plans and arrangements for senior executive officers do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten our value  ii required clawback of any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid or under a legally binding obligation to be paid to a senior executive officer or any of our next most highly compensated employees based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria  iii prohibitions on making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and our five next most highly compensated employees  except for payments for services performed or benefits accrued  iv prohibitions on paying or accruing any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation with respect to our five most highly compensated employees or such higher number as the secretary of the treasury department may determine is in the public interest  except for grants of restricted stock that do not fully vest while we participate in the capital purchase program and do not have a value which exceeds one third of an employee s total annual compensation  v prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  vi retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards or other compensation that the treasury department finds to be inconsistent with the purposes of the capital purchase program or otherwise contrary to the public interest  vii required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  viii inclusion in our proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a non binding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives  and ix agreement not to claim a deduction  for federal income tax purposes  for compensation paid to any of the senior executive officers in excess of  per year 
if we are unable to redeem the treasury preferred stock after five years  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
if we do not redeem the treasury preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially on that date  from per annum to per annum 
depending on our financial condition at the time  this increase in the annual dividend rate on the treasury preferred stock could have a material negative effect on our liquidity 
the treasury preferred stock impacts net income available to holders of our common stock and earnings per share of our common stock  and the exercise of the warrant we issued to the treasury department would be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
while the additional capital we raised through our participation in the treasury department s capital purchase program provides further funding to our business and we believe has improved investor perceptions with regard to our financial position  it has increased our equity and the number of actual and diluted outstanding shares of common stock as well as our preferred dividend requirements 
the dividends declared and the accretion of discount on the treasury preferred stock will reduce the net income available to holders of our common stock and our earnings per share 
the treasury preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to the treasury department in conjunction with the sale to the treasury department of the treasury preferred stock is exercised 
although the treasury department has agreed not to vote any of the common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
we are not paying cash dividends on our common and preferred stock and are deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures that relate to our trust preferred securities  and we are restricted in our ability to resume such payments 
the failure to resume paying dividends and distributions on our securities may adversely affect us 
we historically paid cash dividends on our common stock before we suspended them in september subsequently  we also suspended cash dividends on the treasury preferred stock and began deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes relating to our trust preferred securities 
deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes will result in a deferral of distributions on our trust preferred securities 
future payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be subject to the prior payment of all unpaid dividends on the treasury preferred stock and all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
if we miss six quarterly dividend payments on the treasury preferred stock  whether or not consecutive  the treasury department will have the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
dividends on the treasury preferred stock and deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities are cumulative and therefore unpaid dividends and distributions will accrue and compound on each subsequent payment date 
in the event we become subject to any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of affairs  holders of the trust preferred securities and then holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive the liquidation amounts they are entitled to plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions and dividends  before any distribution to the holders of common stock 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
additionally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
some of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
local or privately held community banking organizations in certain markets may price or structure their products in such a way that it makes it difficult for us to compete in those markets in a way that allows us to meet our profitability or credit goals 
any competitor may choose to offer pricing on loans and deposits that we think is irrational and choose to not compete with 
competitors may also be willing to extend credit without obtaining covenants or collateral and by offering weaker loan structures than we are willing to accept 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services  our reputation with consumers who reside in the markets we serve  the rate at which we introduce new products and services  customer satisfaction  and industry and general economic trends 
if we fail to perform in any of these areas  our competitive position and ability to retain market share or grow would be weakened  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and face legal risks 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not creditors or shareholders 
these regulations affect several areas  including our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  and requirements to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to our customers 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation of statutes  regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies  or the agreements with our regulators could result in more severe enforcement sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
additionally  the number of regulations we must comply with and the financial resources required to comply with those regulations has continually increased 
the cost of complying with these regulations makes it more difficult to remain competitive 
proposals for legislation that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are under consideration in the united states congress and in state legislatures 
the agencies regulating the financial services industry also frequently adopt changes to their regulations 
substantial regulatory and legislative initiatives  including a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory system in the united states are possible in the years ahead 
we are unable to predict whether any of these initiatives will succeed  which form they will take  or whether any additional changes to statutes or regulations  including the interpretation or implementation thereof  will occur in the future 
any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in fraud  operational or other losses that adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fraud risks could include fraud by employees  vendors  customers or anyone we or our customers do business or come in contact with 
the holding company cannot rely on dividends from integra bank 
our holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
historically  it has received substantially all of its revenue from dividends from integra bank 
federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the holding company 
also  a holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event integra bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company  when needed  the holding company may not be able to service debt or pay its obligations  including dividends on the treasury preferred stock 
the inability to receive dividends from integra bank could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our recent losses have had the consequence of not allowing integra bank to pay dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our local markets  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems  including risks to data integrity 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to the risk of additional impairment charges relating to our securities portfolio 
our investment securities portfolio is our second largest earning asset 
the value of our investment portfolio has been adversely affected by the unfavorable conditions of the capital markets in general as well as declines in values of the securities we hold 
we have taken an aggregate of  in charges against earnings since january  for impairments to the value of pooled collateralized debt obligations that we have concluded were other than temporary 
the value of this segment is particularly sensitive to adverse developments affecting the banking industry and the financial condition or performance of the issuing banks factors that we have no control over and as to which we may receive no advance warning  as was the case in the second quarter for one of these securities 
although we believe we have appropriately valued our securities portfolio  we cannot assure you that there will not be additional material impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
possible restrictions on bank overdraft programs could significantly reduce our deposit service charge income 
on november   the federal reserve board announced final rules that prohibit financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine atm and one time debit card transactions 
the new rules require consumers to consent  or opt in  to the overdraft service for these two types of transactions before fees can be charged 
we anticipate these new rules could significantly impact our non sufficient funds and overdraft income the last two quarters of because of the required implementation dates of july for new accounts and august for existing accounts 
a team is currently in place ensuring our systems are ready to meet the new rules 
in addition  this team is working on a communication plan for existing accounts  which will educate our customers on the various overdraft options 
beyond this regulatory change  a bill has been introduced to the house which could place further restrictions on overdraft charges 
if this bill or one similar to it is passed  our service charge income could be reduced even further 
we may not be able to return our stock price to a level necessary to be listed on the nasdaq stock exchange 
we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market inc nasdaq on december   indicating that we no longer met the requirement under rule a the bid price rule because the closing bid price per share of our common stock has been below per share for consecutive business days 
the letter stated that we have until june   to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
nasdaq will provide us written confirmation of compliance with rule a if this condition is met 
should we not regain compliance with the bid price rule prior to the expiration of the grace period  we will receive written notification from nasdaq that our securities are subject to delisting 
alternatively  we may be eligible for an additional grace period if we meet the initial listing standards  with the exception of bid price  for the nasdaq capital market 
we will need to submit an application to transfer our securities from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
if the application is approved  nasdaq will notify us that we have been granted an additional calendar day grace period

overview the unfavorable economic conditions that have persisted since continued to significantly impact the banking industry and our performance during during  we continued to experience significant increases in non performing assets and loan loss provisions

non performing assets increased to  at december   compared to  at december  net interest income was  for  compared to  for  while the net interest margin was for  compared to in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a higher level of non accrual loans throughout non interest income decreased  to  primarily driven by higher securities losses of  and  for a mark to market adjustment for the warrant we issued in february discussed further below  partially offset by  of deposit premiums from the branch sales  higher loan sale gains of and an increase in debit card interchange income 
non interest expense decreased  to  primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge taken in the expenses include increases in fdic assessments of  and loan collection and other real estate owned oreo costs of  partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses of  low cost deposit average balances  which include non interest checking  now and savings deposits were  during the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or from the fourth quarter of  primarily from savings deposits 
commercial loan average balances were  in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  or from the fourth quarter of this included declines in commercial real estate of  or and commercial and industrial of  or 
direct consumer balances decreased  or  while home equity loans increased  or 
we successfully executed a number of strategic initiatives during we increased our capital by  by participating in the treasury department s capital purchase program  we successfully completed three branch and loan sale transactions  which improved our capital and liquidity 
we collected  in deposit premiums on the ten sold branches 
the loan sales included the sale of  of commercial loans generated by our commercial and industrial c i loan production group based in covington  kentucky 
this c i loan production office  or lpo  was then closed and the entire staff was hired by the purchaser 
to date in  we have announced the signing of definitive agreements to sell thirteen more branches  which is expected to generate capital  while being liquidity neutral 
we realized early payoffs or paydowns of  of commercial real estate loans through an early repayment incentive program 
our workout team developed and is executing plans to exit the commercial real estate loans and non performing assets in chicago area  while implementing a similar approach for our other non performing commercial real estate cre loans 
we closed our louisville  kentucky and nashville  tennessee commercial real estate lpos and announced the closure of our cleveland  ohio lpo which was subsequently completed in january  as part of our plans to exit that business 
we negotiated a sale or surrender of  of bank owned life insurance  receiving  of those proceeds during  with the remainder expected in we repositioned our investment securities portfolio to reduce the credit risk in that portfolio 
we executed a profit improvement initiative  which resulted in a significant reduction in non interest expenses and enhancement of non interest income 
we suspended payment of cash dividends on our outstanding preferred stock  suspended dividends on our common stock  and deferred the payment of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated notes related to our trust preferred securities 
we continued to execute efforts to retain and grow deposits  and saw deposit growth  even with the branch divestitures 
we completed the transition to new executive leadership that is clearly focused on the execution of strategies to position us for long term success 
during the fourth quarter our new management team and the board of directors clearly defined our future vision and execution strategies that will drive short term actions and position us for long term success 
our future vision calls for a disciplined focus on community banking within a narrower geographic footprint 
accordingly  we are pursuing multiple execution strategies as follows first  we are exiting the commercial real estate lending line of business  not just for the short term in these challenging economic times  but for the long term as well 
we will manage our current commercial real estate exposure downward through the sale of performing and nonperforming loans  discontinue the generation of any new commitments  and provide incentives to our customers and relationship managers to prepay their outstanding loans and increase our yields as pricing opportunities arise 
our remaining cre relationship managers have been reassigned to our loan workout group to emphasize our strategy and desired outcome 
second  we will narrow our geographic operating footprint through the sale of multiple branch clusters 
the sale completed in december was the first transaction executed under this strategy and the definitive agreement for the sale of three branches in eastern indiana announced on february   is the next 
on february   we announced signing another definitive agreement for the sale of two kentucky branches 
we also announced on march   the agreement to sale five kentucky and three indiana branches 
we have received multiple letters of intent regarding significant additional branch clusters with numerous parties having completed  or being in the midst of completing due diligence toward reaching definitive agreements regarding these transactions and anticipate announcing multiple transactions during the first half of regarding these efforts 
third  the additional capital generated from these asset divestitures  both from the gain on sale as well as reduced risk weighted assets  will allow us to increase sales of both performing and nonperforming assets  ensuring adequate levels of liquidity and improving our credit quality measures 
finally  as we execute branch and asset divestitures  we will aggressively reduce our cost structure to match our core earning capacity  aggressively market our services to community relationship customers  and return to profitability 
throughout this process  we will continue to focus on delivering exceptional customer service and transitioning our customers in a seamless fashion 
at december   integra bank s ratios were above the regulatory minimum for well capitalized status 
in august  integra bank agreed with the occ to develop a plan to increase its tier one capital level to at least  and its risk based capital to at least 
at december   these capital ratios were not met 
we notified the occ that the increased capital levels would not be achieved 
we expect the occ will reevaluate our progress toward the higher capital ratios at march  integra bank corporation s capital ratios were within the regulatory requirements for being adequately capitalized 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the section labeled credit management below provides additional information on this subject 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  we use assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience and the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale and other real estate owned  as well as fair values associated with derivative financial instruments  intangible assets and the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are typically based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities or level values 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information on how we determine level values 
the fair values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted prices 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
if necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we assessed goodwill for impairment quarterly during by applying a series of fair value based tests 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded goodwill impairment of  and  respectively 
impairment exists when the net book value of our one reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
core deposit intangibles are recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash flow model valuation at the time of acquisition and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
customer relationship intangibles utilize a method that discounts the cash flows related to future loan relationships that are expected to result from referrals from existing customers 
estimated cash flows are determined based on estimated future net interest income resulting from these relationships  less a provision for loan losses  non interest expense  income taxes and contributory asset charges 
other than temporary securities impairment declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are other than temporary are reflected as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  we consider the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
for securities falling under eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  which was subsequently incorporated into asc  such as collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred when there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows principal or interest to be received and the fair value of the beneficial interest is less than its carrying amount 
in determining whether an adverse change in cash flows occurred  the present value of the remaining cash flows  as estimated at the initial transaction date or the last date previously revised  was compared to the present value of the expected cash flows at the current reporting date 
the estimated cash flows reflect those a market participant would use and were discounted at a rate equal to the current effective yield 
if an other than temporary impairment was recognized as a result of this analysis  the yield was changed to the market rate 
the last revised estimated cash flows were then used for future impairment analysis purposes 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no asc 
this asc substantially aligns the basis for determining impairment with the guidance found in paragraph of sfas no 
 or asc  which requires entities to assess whether it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms 
asc does not require exclusive reliance on market participant assumptions regarding future cash flows  permitting the use of reasonable management judgment of the probability that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due 
in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
and no 
 recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends existing guidance for determining otti for debt securities 
the fsp requires an entity to assess whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the amount related to credit losses  while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
additionally  the fsp expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other than temporary impairments for debt and equity securities 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
an assessment is made as to whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized

net interest income net interest income in the following tables is presented on a tax equivalent basis and is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense paid on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates  and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the schedule following the three year average balance sheet analysis

the net interest margin was  compared to in major components of the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets decreased  or  and consisted mainly of lower residential mortgage loan average balances of  and lower securities average balances of  the increase in commercial loan average balances was largely in our commercial real estate portfolio due to additional funding against committed credit facilities 
the average rate of commercial loans decreased basis points  as rates declined throughout and the level of non accrual loans increased 
approximately of our variable rate loans are tied to prime  to a libor index and to other floating rate indexes 
during  the prime rate remained the same  while one month and three month libor rates decreased and basis points  respectively

total average commercial loans represented of total earning assets for  up from for the yield on commercial loans for was basis points lower than the yield on securities compared to  when commercial loan yields were basis points higher than more stable securities yields 
we are asset sensitive  meaning that a change in prevailing interest rates impacts our assets more quickly than our liabilities 
if rates were to rise  our asset yields should increase faster and more than the cost of the liabilities funding those assets  causing our net interest margin to increase 
non interest bearing deposit average balances increased  while the average balances of savings and interest bearing demand deposits  which have an average cost of basis points  increased  while the average balance of earning assets decreased  the cash balance included in other non earning assets increased in order to maintain a higher level of liquidity 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased which helped generate the additional cash 
low cost deposits increased  brokered deposits increased  term auction facility borrowings from the federal reserve increased  and borrowings under the fdic s temporary loan guaranty program increased  this was partially offset by declines in federal home loan bank advances of  retail certificates of deposit of  money market accounts of  federal funds purchased of  and repurchase agreements of  the decline in interest rates throughout resulted in lower liabilities costs 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was for  a basis point decline from short term borrowings rates declined basis points and long term borrowings rates declined basis points 
net interest income for was  or higher than an increase in overall earning assets contributed positively to net interest income 
a higher level of non accrual loans offset this increase  as did the impact from reductions in interest rates  coupled with the inability to further reduce certain funding costs that have reached a floor

non interest bearing deposit average balances increased  while the average balances of savings and interest bearing demand deposits  which have an average cost of basis points  increased  the increase in the average balance of earning assets was funded by the increase in low cost deposits  along with increases in short term federal home loan bank advances of  long term advances of  brokered deposits of  and federal funds purchased of  this was partially offset by a decline in retail certificates of deposit of  the average cost of funds for federal home loan bank advances declined basis points to  money market declined basis points to and time deposits declined basis points to non interest income non interest income for was  which was  or lower than results for included deposit premiums of  from the branch sales and higher loan sale gains of which were offset by decreases in bank owned life insurance income of  trading income of  deposit service charges of  annuity commissions of  and the warrant fair value adjustment of  securities losses were  for  compared to losses of  for major contributors to the change in non interest income from to are as follows premiums received from the assumption of deposits in the sales of branch locations in totaled  however deposit service charges declined by  in part  due to these sales 
bank owned life insurance declined  due to our decision to sell or surrender the majority of the policies in order to reduce risk weighted assets to improve our regulatory capital ratios 
trading income decreased due to the decline in fair value of our securities classified as held for trading 
during the fourth quarter  we sold all of our treasury notes that were held for trading 
annuity commissions decreased as interest rates declined on the products 
the decrease was also a result of the economy and customers preference to invest in short term fdic insured products instead of a long term product 
the tax deferral element became less attractive as rates fell 
our treasury warrant was reflected as a liability at march   because it was not fully exercisable at the time of issuance 
the  non tax deductible fair value adjustment reflects the change in value of the treasury warrant from march   through the date it was reclassified to equity

this increase is attributed to higher levels of real estate owned and related expenses  expenses incurred in connection with loan workout and collection activities and loan portfolio management expenses  such as the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans 
the increase in writedowns on oreo properties in totaled  fdic insurance premiums increased by  in for several reasons

the decrease in stock based compensation expense occurred mainly from adjustments to our forfeiture rates 
due to the sale or surrender of the boli policies  the liability from the related compensation cost of the split dollar policies was reversed through post retirement insurance 
the reduction in k plan expense reflects the suspension of our matching k contribution in an effort to control personnel expense

the increase in stock based compensation expense included of forfeiture adjustments 
at december   we had ftes compared to ftes in loan and oreo expenses increased  or 
this increase is attributed to higher levels of oreo and related expenses  expenses incurred in connection with loan workout and collection activities  and loan portfolio management expenses  such as the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans 
occupancy expenses increased  or  due to the full year of the chicago locations  increases in building maintenance and repairs  and higher utilities 
fraud and other losses increased  or  due primarily to higher check kiting losses 
sales and franchise taxes increased  or  due to increases in kentucky and ohio franchise taxes because of a change in apportionment ratios resulting from the prairie acquisition  coupled with sales tax liabilities resulting from an audit by the indiana department of revenue 
communication and transportation expenses increased  or  due primarily to an increase of in telephone expense related to a data line upgrade that included start up costs and a short period of time where both expense from the old and new lines was being incurred  as well as  the addition of two new locations and a full year of expense in chicago 
software expense increased  or  because of additional investments in remote branch capture  treasury management  account opening  budgeting and payroll processing software and maintenance 
processing expense increased  or  primarily in the areas of atm and debit card processing  in large part due to the impact of a full year of expense from the chicago region  coupled with higher debit card costs attributed to higher levels of debit card usage 
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of  in  as compared to income tax benefit of  in  and expense of  in the recognition of income tax expense for resulted mainly from a non cash charge of approximately  to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
the full valuation allowance was equal to our deferred tax asset at year end 
the effective rate of the income tax provision for the year ended december   was 
the effective rate for the year ended december   is not meaningful due to the size of our operating loss relative to the income tax expense resulting from the increase in the valuation allowance 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of the expected future taxable income is not sufficient to support the use of the carryforward  credit or other deferred tax asset 
a three year cumulative loss position and continued near term losses represent significant negative evidence that caused us to conclude that a  increase in the valuation allowance was necessary at december  the increase in the valuation allowance does not have any impact on our liquidity  nor does it preclude us from using the tax losses  tax credits or other timing differences in the future 
to the extent that we generate taxable income in a given quarter  the valuation allowance may be reduced to fully or partially offset the corresponding income tax expense 
any remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed through income tax expense once we can demonstrate a sustainable return to profitability and conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be utilized prior to expiration

fourth quarter and fourth quarter net loss available to common shareholders was  or per diluted share  while the pre tax loss was  the pre tax loss for the fourth quarter of was largely attributable to the provision for loan losses of  the income tax expense for the fourth quarter of was  which included an increase in our deferred income tax valuation allowance of  fourth quarter results  as compared to third quarter  included an increase in the provision for loan losses of  and a decrease in non interest expense of  as well as a decrease in non interest income of and net interest income of the increased provision was primarily allocated to cre and construction and land development loans which represented of total non performing loans 
the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by  for the fourth quarter of the allowance to total loans increased basis points to at december   while annualized net charge offs increased basis points to 
non performing loans increased to  or of total loans  compared to at september   while the allowance to non performing loans decreased from to for the same dates 
non performing assets increased to  compared to  at september  the net charge off ratio for all of was 
net interest income was  for the fourth quarter of  compared to  for the third quarter of  while the net interest margin increased basis points to 
the increase in the margin was due mainly from the improvement in deposit funding costs 
low cost deposits  which include non interest checking  now and savings deposits  decreased during the fourth quarter by  primarily due to the branch sale completed during the fourth quarter 
retail certificates of deposit decreased  brokered certificates of deposit increased  and money market balances declined  commercial loan average balances decreased  in the fourth quarter of cre decreased  and commercial and land development loans decreased  the remaining commercial decreased  mainly due to the loan sale that occurred late in the third quarter 
the remaining loan and branch divestiture that closed late in the fourth quarter had only a small impact on average balances 
non interest income was  for the fourth quarter of  compared to  for the third quarter 
the fourth quarter included  for the deposit premium from the branch sale  compared to the third quarter securities gains of  non interest expense for the fourth quarter of was  the income tax expense for the fourth quarter of was  which includes an increase in our deferred income tax valuation allowance of  including this charge  the reserve is equal to the entire deferred income tax asset 
the tax expense from the increase in the valuation allowance is partially offset by the income tax benefit resulting from the fourth quarter loss adjusted for tax credits and tax free loan and municipal security income 
the fourth quarter net loss was  or  per diluted share 
financial condition total assets at december   were  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  including federal funds sold and other short term investments totaled  at december   compared to  one year prior 
the balance of this account fluctuates daily based on the needs of our customers 
however  the majority of the year over year increase in the cash position was driven by our desire to maintain a higher level of liquidity during securities available for sale and trading securities the securities portfolio represents our second largest earning asset after loans and serves as a liquidity source for us 
total investment securities classified as available for sale of  comprised of total assets at december   compared to at december   reflecting a  decrease during securities held for trading totaled at december  and were comprised of four pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations  or cdos 
during and  we continued to reduce the size of our securities portfolio 
we used the cash flows in to help fund growth in our commercial loan portfolio 
in  we used the cash flow to reduce debt and improve liquidity

mortgage backed securities and cmos represented of the available for sale securities portfolio at december   as compared to at december  mortgage backed securities carry an inherent prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates

we regularly review the composition of our securities portfolio  taking into account market risks  the current and expected interest rate environment  liquidity needs  and our overall interest rate risk profile and strategic goals 
on a quarterly basis or more frequently when necessary  we evaluate each security in our portfolio with an individual unrealized loss to determine if that loss represents other than temporary impairment 
the factors we consider in evaluating the securities include whether the securities were guaranteed by the us government or its agencies and the securities public ratings  if available  and how those two factors affect credit quality and recovery of the full principal balance  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  the length of time the securities have had temporary impairment and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
we also review the payment performance  delinquency history and credit support of the underlying collateral for certain securities in our portfolio as part of our impairment analysis and review 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional discussion of securities

the shift out of construction and land development loans to commercial mortgage loans reflects the completion of construction for several of the projects securing these loans 
commercial loans in the chicago region totaled  at december   compared to  at december  during  the chicago commercial portfolio experienced significant increases in past due and non performing loans  as well as higher losses

a total of  of our non performing loans at december   were located in south carolina  in which we had  of loans outstanding 
the majority of projects located outside of indiana  kentucky  illinois and ohio are with developers located in or with a major presence in our four state area that have developed or are developing properties in other states 
we do not execute non recourse financing 
the reduction in size of our loan portfolio  along with the change in the cre segment  and the planned decline in our indirect consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios has increased our level of concentration risk 
the balance in our non owner occupied cre portfolio decreased from  or of the total loan portfolio at december   to  or of the total portfolio at december  the change in our non owner occupied cre portfolio from to is attributable  in part  to the disruption of the permanent financing market  which has made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance completed and stabilized projects on a permanent basis 
during the third quarter of  we discontinued pursuing new non owner occupied cre opportunities  regardless of property type  as additional stress of this product became apparent 
we are now exiting the cre line of business all together 
we will reduce our current cre exposure through the sale of performing and nonperforming loans  not make any new commitments  and incent our customers and relationship managers to reduce their outstandings ahead of their prescribed maturities and increase our yields as pricing opportunities arise 
during the second and third quarters of  we offered a discount to some of our cre customers in exchange for early repayment 
we did this to reduce our concentration in commercial real estate  which in turn reduces our credit risk and improves our regulatory capital ratios 
the discounts are reflected as charge offs at the time the payments are received 
the provision for loan loss recorded as payments are received is the difference between the discount given and the reserves for those credits already included in the allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs for this program totaled  while payoffs or paydowns totaled  this program ended on september  cre loan balances in chicago were  at december  compared to  at december  cre balances from our team headquartered in cincinnati  ohio were  at december  compared to  at december  c i loans decreased  or  from year end this decline reflected the sale of  of a pool of primarily commercial loans originated in our covington  kentucky lpo in the fourth quarter of residential mortgage loans decreased  or  from year end we expect the balance of residential mortgage loans will continue to decline during  since we sell substantially all originations to a private label provider on a servicing released basis 
we evaluate our counterparty risk with this provider on a quarterly basis by evaluating their financial results and the potential impact to our relationship with them of any declines in financial performance 
if we were unable to sell loans to this provider  we would seek an alternate provider and record new loans on our balance sheet until one was found  impacting both our liquidity and our interest rate risk 
we have never had a strategy of originating subprime or alt a mortgages  option adjustable rate mortgages or any other exotic mortgage products 
the impact of private mortgage insurance is not material to our determination of loss factors within the allowance for loan losses for the residential mortgage portfolio 
loans with private mortgage insurance comprise only a portion of our portfolio and the coverage amount typically does not exceed of the loan balance 
home equity lines of credit  or heloc loans decreased  or  at december   from year end  mainly due to the branch and loan sales

nonaccrual loans are loans on which we have suspended recognizing interest because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question or when we determine the loan is impaired 
loans which are less than days past due  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position

the increase in non performing loans and oreo is primarily due to the ongoing housing downturn that began in  affecting not only residential mortgage lending  but also cre lending related to residential construction 
during  we continued to experience a decline in credit quality  primarily limited to residential construction and development  although we did begin to experience some decline in other portfolios as macro factors continued to deteriorate in the economy

the case schiller index of residential housing values shows a decline in the value of chicago single family residential properties of from the peak of the index in september to the most recent index for november  as published in january the zillow index for the fourth quarter of shows a decline of from its peak during the second quarter of on a year over year basis  the zillow index shows a decline of for all homes  with a decline for single family housing and a decline for condominiums 
new appraisal values we have obtained for existing loans have been consistent generally with the declines indicated by the case schiller and zillow indices 
many potential buyers are choosing to rent rather than buy at this time  with market information indicating an increase in rental demand and rental rates 
should sales levels in chicago remain stable at their current values or continue to decline in  there is risk that we would experience further deterioration in this segment

potential problem loans  which consisted of primarily non owner occupied cre loans at december   are maintained on a watch list and reviewed at least quarterly 
for the most part  loans are designated as watch list loans to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to ensure proper earning status and management strategy 
if we determine that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract  then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
we also review nonaccrual loans on an ongoing basis 
credit management our credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee met eleven times during the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department  as well as by a compliance department and regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of limited individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers  senior loan committee  the chief credit and risk officer and the chief executive officer 
a limited number of officers have the authority  in certain cases and for certain loan types  to override centrally denied loan requests 
those overrides must meet certain conditions and are centrally tracked and monitored for performance 
in addition  any relationship that has an aggregate exposure of  must be approved by a senior loan committee consisting of senior credit officers  the chief credit administration officer  the chief credit and risk officer  and the chief executive officer 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount that  in our opinion  is adequate to absorb probable incurred loan losses as determined by our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the loan portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  loss data over an extended period of time  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  industry concentrations  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and current economic conditions 
we charge off loans that we deem uncollectible to the allowance  and credit recoveries of previously charged off amounts to the allowance 
we charge a provision for loan losses against earnings at levels we believe are necessary to assure that the allowance can absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
we conduct reviews on selected loans  based on size to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses quarterly or more frequently as stated within our formal agreement with our federal regulators 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the relationship manager responsible for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to us 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which was subsequently incorporated into asc we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer  installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in our geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any forecasting methodology 
at december   the unallocated reserve included within the allowance for loan losses was  as compared to  at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance increased during for two reasons 
the first was to reflect the pace of change and unpredictability of the current economic environment and how it could affect our estimate of losses 
the second is to provide for those loans which are collateral dependent in terms of potential additional collateral stress  given the continued declines in the market value of real estate collateral across our lending footprint 
the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which was subsequently incorporated into asc  are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by our periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the credit and risk management committee of the board of directors for review  and to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
we have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  we rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
our process to perform this analysis includes expanded data analysis  back testing and ongoing refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance provides reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for our categories of loans with similar risk characteristics and analyzes loss data over the period of time that we believe is appropriate when coupled with management adjustments we apply towards that data 
the appropriateness of management adjustments is considered in terms of market conditions  portfolio performance and portfolio concentrations 
in considering market conditions  we review a variety of information including unemployment statistics  foreclosure rates and housing statistics from third party indices and reports 
we believe this improves the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
this process does not impact losses estimated in accordance with asc the allowance for loan losses was  at december   representing of total loans  compared to  at september   or of total loans and  at december   or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans ratio was at december   compared to at september  and at december  we do not target specific allowance to total loans or allowance to non performing loan percentages when determining the adequacy of the allowance  but we do consider and evaluate the factors that go into making that determination 
at december   we believe that our allowance appropriately considers the expected loss in our non performing loans 
the provision for loan losses was  for the three months ended december   and  for the twelve months ended december  this compares to  and  for the three and twelve months ended december  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by  during the fourth quarter of annualized net charge offs to average loans were for the quarter  compared to for the fourth quarter of  and for the twelve months ended december  for the fourth quarter of  net charge offs included  of cre  of commercial  of indirect consumer loan  of home equity  and of checking account net charge offs  while the remaining came from various other loan categories 
cre net charge offs during the fourth quarter of included  for a multifamily purpose property located in ohio   for a land acquisition property located in chicago  and  for a residential development purpose property located in indiana 
for  net charge offs included  of cre   of commercial   of indirect consumer loans   of home equity loans   of residential mortgage and of checking accounts net charge offs while the remaining came from various other loan categories 
the largest loss taken during the year was for a  line of credit secured by the stock for a financial institution located in ohio  which was subsequently seized by the regulators 
the other four largest losses were commercial real estate projects originated and managed by our cre line of business as the second largest loss of  was secured by a multifamily residential project located in florida followed by  secured by a multifamily commercial real estate project located in ohio 
the next large loss was a project secured by a large condominium development located in south carolina which totaled  and managed by our cre line of business 
the fifth large loss is a project for retail purposes located in ohio that totaled a loss of  we continuously improve our credit management processes 
in  we took the following actions 
we continued to obtain new appraisals on properties securing our cre non performing loans and used those appraisals to help determine any specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses 
as we receive new appraisals on properties securing non performing loans  we recognize charge offs  and adjust specific reserves as appropriate 
we reorganized our chicago staff and have dedicated additional resources to reducing the chicago portfolio 
we shifted the credit analysis effort for our chicago portfolio from chicago to our centralized business service center in evansville 
we are exiting the cre lending line of business  and have closed and consolidated our nashville  louisville and cleveland cre lpos into our cincinnati based cre group 
we offered a discount to some of our cre customers in exchange for early repayment in an effort to reduce our cre balances 
we have added additional loan workout specialists to our chicago and cre group and transitioned our relationship managers to assist with orderly exit strategy similar to our chicago plan 
loans  for which the terms have been modified  and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties  are considered troubled debt restructurings

long term borrowings remained nearly unchanged at  at december   compared to  at december  we continuously review our liability composition 
any modifications could adversely affect our profitability and capital levels over the near term  but would be undertaken if we believe that restructuring the balance sheet will improve our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile on a longer term basis 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about our long term debt

our long term borrowings represent fhlb advances with various terms and rates collateralized primarily by first mortgage loans and certain specifically assigned securities  securities sold under repurchase agreements  notes payable secured by equipment  subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
we are also committed under various operating leases for premises and equipment 
in the normal course of our business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingencies  including letters of credit and standby letters of credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to credit loss in the event the nonperformance by the other party to the commitment is limited to the contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for other on balance sheet instruments

the treasury preferred stock bears a five percent dividend for each of the first five years of the investment  and nine percent thereafter  unless the shares are redeemed 
the shares are callable at par at any time subject to prior consultation with the federal reserve and may be repurchased at any time under certain conditions 
the treasury department also received a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
we are subject to the cpp s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds our securities 
see the discussion of the capital purchase program  in the regulation and supervision section contained in item of this document for further details about those standards 
during  we made capital contributions of  into integra bank using cpp funds 
this additional capital positively impacted integra bank s capital ratios and liquidity 
we paid cash dividends on our common stock until we suspended them in september we also suspended cash dividends on the treasury preferred stock and began deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes relating to our trust preferred securities obligations 
future payment of any cash dividends on our common stock will be subject to the prior payment of all unpaid dividends on the treasury preferred stock and all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
if we miss six quarterly dividend payments on this preferred stock  whether or not consecutive  the treasury department will have the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
the first quarter of included a  reduction to non interest income for a non tax deductible mark to market adjustment for the treasury warrant 
the treasury warrant was reflected as a liability because it was not fully exercisable at the time of issuance 
the value of the treasury warrant increased by  in april  prior to being transferred to equity 
this resulted in  of expense in the second quarter 
the transfer of the treasury warrant to equity improved the holding company s capital ratios  but did not affect those of integra bank 
the banking industry is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december  and  we and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
integra bank has agreed with the occ to develop a plan to increase its total capital ratio to at least and its tier leverage ratio to by march  see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital for the parent holding company under federal reserve guidelines 
as part of our capital improvement plan  we sold eight banking offices and selected assets and deposits of two other offices  receiving  of deposit premiums 
the eight branches sold were located in georgetown  lexington  lawrenceburg  warsaw  crittenden  and dry ridge  kentucky 
we also closed an office in chicago  illinois 
we restructured our investment portfolio  improving our capital position as the sale generated a gain of  while we replaced the sold securities with gnma securities and us treasuries that carry a zero percent risk weight  therefore lowering risk weighted assets and improving our total risk based capital ratios by approximately basis points 
we sold  of bank owned life insurance  receiving  of those proceeds during reducing assets with a higher risk weighting 
we also offered an early repayment incentive program for commercial real estate loans thus reducing  of these higher risk weighted assets 
our on going strategy for maintaining or increasing capital and positioning us for long term success  include the following exiting our cre lending line of business  narrowing our geographic operating footprint through the sale of multiple branch clusters  selling performing and nonperforming loans  reducing risk weighted assets while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and improving our credit quality measures  and reducing our cost structures to match our core earning capacity and return to profitability 
liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to fund existing commitments  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings 
we continuously monitor our current and prospective business activity in order to design maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments that are in line with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
during the second half of  the financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility as the interbank markets were severely disrupted and federal funds rates varied widely intraday 
the actions taken by the treasury department and the fdic included increases in insurance coverage  extension of discount window availability and borrowing terms  creation of the cpp  and term auction facility taf along with the creation of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program s debt guarantee program as alternative sources of liquidity tlgp 
all of these actions have improved the performance of the financial markets and reduced deposit volatility for integra bank  the primary sources of short term asset liquidity have been cash  federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans along with monthly cash flows from mortgage back security portfolio and maturing securities 
the balance between these sources and the need to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under our capital markets risk policy 
when these sources are not considered to be adequate  we have utilized brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  secured funding through the tlgp program and utilized borrowing programs from the federal reserve including taf 
we may also utilize integra bank s borrowing capacity with the fhlb and sell investment securities and loans 
due to continued uncertainty in the financial markets we elected to maintain a higher level of liquidity during we took steps to increase our cash position throughout cash and due from banks totaled  at december  as compared to  at december  we increased use of the brokered certificate of deposit markets to diversify our sources of funding  extend our maturities and improve pricing at various desired terms as compared to local market pricing 
we utilized the taf program at various times throughout as a source of short term funding and paid off the  balance in october integra bank participated in the tlgp debt program and issued a  aggregate principal amount fdic guaranteed note during the first quarter this senior unsecured note is due in and carries an interest rate of 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold and other short term investments were  and additionally  at december   we had in excess of  in unencumbered securities available for repurchase agreements or liquidation 
at december   integra bank is also eligible for over  in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and had in excess of  with the federal reserve bank under the secondary credit program 
the bank has  available from unused  uncommitted federal funds lines  however  in the current economic environment it is highly unlikely that we would be able to access these unsecured lines 
during the third and fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the federal reserve cited improvement in financial markets conditions allowing the federal reserve and fdic to begin designing and implementing exit strategies that would normalize the emergency lending facilities and liquidity initiatives described above 
the federal reserve is encouraging banks to utilize pre financial crisis funding sources 
they announced the final auction for taf would take place on march  meanwhile they also raised the discount window borrowing rate and reduced the maturity on discount window loans from days back to overnight 
therefore at the end of  integra bank began the process of shifting collateral pledged for borrowing capacity from the federal reserve back to the fhlb in an effort to maximize the borrowing capacity and allow for longer maturities 
subsequently as of january  the excess borrowing capacity at the fhlb was in excess of  while the capacity at the federal reserve was in excess of  under the secondary credit program 
on august   the fdic announced an extension of the transaction account guarantee program  which provides unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts  as well as transaction accounts bearing an interest rate no higher than 
financial institutions may opt out of this program 
we did not opt out and plan to maintain the higher coverage amounts until the expiration date of june  this follows extension of the per depositor insurance coverage  which had been increased from  through december liquidity at the holding company level has historically been provided by dividends from integra bank  cash balances  liquid assets  and proceeds from capital market transactions 
federal banking law limits the amount of dividends that national banks can pay to their holding companies without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
at december   the holding company did not have availability under an existing credit line 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including the amount of its net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and net profits for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration 
because of recent losses  integra bank cannot pay any dividends to us without advance approval from the bank s primary regulator 
should integra bank make such a request  no assurance can be given that it would be approved 
liquidity is required to support operational expenses  pay taxes  meet outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations  and other general corporate purposes 
in order to enhance our liquidity  we have suspended payments of cash dividends on all of our outstanding stock  and deferred the payment of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated notes 
the trust documents allow us to defer payments of interest for up to five years without default or penalty 
during the deferral period  the respective trusts will likewise suspend the declaration and payment of distributions on the trust preferred securities 
also during the deferral period  we may not  among other things and with limited exceptions  pay cash dividends on or repurchase our common stock or preferred stock nor make any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated notes 
we believe that the dividend suspension and deferred distributions will preserve approximately  per quarter based on the level of dividend and interest payments at time of deferral  thereby enhancing our liquidity and our ability to bolster integra bank s capital ratios 
at december   the cash balance held by the parent company was  which is expected to remain stable as our cash inflows are similar to our cash outflows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
our interest rate risk management program is comprised of several components 
they include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
the objective of our interest rate risk management processes is to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and capital 
our interest rate risk is managed through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least quarterly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
we measure and monitor interest rate risk on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the model is externally validated periodically by an independent third party 
we use the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
we consider ear to be our best measure for managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income nii that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
since march   we have used a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using a static yield curve 
prior to that  implied forward rates were used for the base scenario 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the base scenario yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolios 
this simulation model projects the net interest income under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   we would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a positive change in net interest income 
the positive change in nii to rising rates is driven by a high volume of floating rate loans  an absence of overnight funding and the use of longer term fixed rate brokered cds to lock in liquidity 
because current rates are near historically low levels  it is remote that rates could decline basis points 
therefore  this scenario has minimal meaning and we have chosen to evaluate the impact in a downward basis point rate shock to evaluate our risk 
ear in the downward basis point scenario was negative at december  versus a negative at december  the simulation for the upward bp scenario is well within the policy limits established by the board alco 
the positive change in ear in the scenario from to was largely driven by a change in the balance sheet mix 
this included reductions in long term fixed rate securities and overnight funding combined with locking in additional longer term fixed rate debt  primarily broker cds 
trends in earnings at risk estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
we consider eve to be our best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario based on the current yield curve 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the current yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects multiple rate paths under each rate scenario and projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities for each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points with a limit of minus 
at december   we would experience a negative change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a positive change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
again  as a basis point reduction in rates currently has minimal meaning  we have chosen to evaluate the impact in a downward basis point rate shock to evaluate our risk 
eve risk in the downward basis point scenario was negative at december  versus a negative at december  eve risk to rising rates was largely unchanged as the impact from the reduction in the volume of the fixed rate securities portfolio was partially offset by an increase in the average life of the portfolio 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the impact from extending term debt through broker cds was offset by a decrease in year end demand deposits along with an increase in premium rate savings deposits 
trends in economic value of equity estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
