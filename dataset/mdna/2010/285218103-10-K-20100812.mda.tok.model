this report and all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section 
we do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report

part i item business 
we are one of the largest global organizations devoted to the rental  lease and sale of new and used electronic test and measurement t m equipment 
we purchase that equipment from leading manufacturers such as agilent technologies  inc agilent and tektronix primarily for use by our customers in the aerospace  defense  telecommunications  electronics  industrial and semiconductor industries 
although it represents only approximately of our revenues in fiscal  we believe our data products dp division is one of the largest rental companies in the united states for personal computers and servers from manufacturers including dell  hp compaq  ibm and toshiba 
we have also recently expanded our efforts in the rental  lease and sale of industrial equipment such as electrical test equipment and inspection equipment 
the electro rent approach 
for the most part  customers who purchase or lease equipment from us place orders through our inside sales force  which has access to our proprietary computer system that is updated in real time for equipment availability and pricing 
in the case of rentals and some leases  we generally use a pool of equipment we have previously purchased for that purpose or we may add equipment to that pool to fill a lease or rental order if the addition makes sense 
our equipment fulfillment team typically can arrange delivery of equipment from our pool to our customers within one or two days of a request 
most of our equipment is technically complex and must be calibrated and serviced when returned to us 
we do most of that calibration in house  using a team of experienced technicians and our state of the art calibration laboratory 
although our customers respond to equipment pricing and availabilities in making their decisions to choose to work with us  we believe that our success also depends on other factors customer responsiveness 
our customer service  responsiveness and expert technical staff provide us a key competitive advantage 
our new authorized technology partnership atp sales agreement with agilent  for the united states and canada  has enabled us to substantially expand the number and technical expertise of our t m sales force  which at approximately persons is the largest among our principal competitors 
our management team is the most experienced and stable in the industry  averaging years at electro rent 
forbes magazine named us as one of their most trustworthy companies out of the more than  publicly traded companies for what forbes termed transparent and conservative accounting practices and solid corporate governance and management 
global platform 
although our customers represent a cross section of the economy  much of our business is conducted with large companies in the aerospace and defense  semiconductor  electronics and telecommunications industries 
as the largest t m rental  leasing and sales company in north america  and one of the only rental companies in the world with a global platform and key locations in the us  canada  china and europe  our size and reach appeals to our multinational customers and assists us in maximizing our equipment utilization and inventory management across different geographic markets 
multichannel offerings 
in the last two years  we have expanded our business to offer customers a single source for their equipment acquisitions  whether they want to rent  lease or buy new or used equipment 
we believe that we offer the greatest breadth of acquisition options in the industry  allowing our customers to match the appropriate option to their usage and capital and other factors  such as accounting rules and regulatory requirements 
in addition  spreading costs over multiple channels allows us to maintain the largest sales force among our principal competitors  which in turn broadens and deepens our customer contacts and provides them more technical strength and assistance 
deep vendor relationships 
we have worked to develop and maintain strong relationships with the major manufacturers of equipment  who are our principal suppliers 
we build these relationships not only on our rental and leasing activities  which makes us one of the largest customers of these manufacturers  but also by partnering with our vendors to sell their products 
by maintaining close relationships with multiple vendors  we can help our customers select the right equipment for their needs  better fill customer orders for equipment with long lead times  and understand product development trends which tend to shape the nature of the demands of our rental and leasing customers as well as the prices for our used equipment 
dynamic inventory management systems 
to maximize our overall profit from the rental  leasing  and sales of equipment  we manage our equipment pool on an on going basis by controlling the timing  pricing and mix of our purchases and sales 
we acquire new and used equipment to meet current technological standards and current and anticipated customer demand  and we sell our used equipment where we believe that is the most lucrative option 
we employ a complex equipment management strategy and our proprietary perfect software to adjust our inventory and pricing on a dynamic basis in order to maximize equipment availability  utilization and profitability 
we manage each specific equipment class based on a separate assessment of that equipment s historical and projected life cycle and numerous other factors  including the us and global economy  interest rates and new product launches 
our strategic growth initiatives 
we believe that our resources and financial infrastructure remain capable of handling a significantly greater volume of business activity without a proportionate increase in expenses 
based on this belief  we have been seeking ways to increase revenues to leverage that infrastructure through internal growth and external acquisitions 
these strategies include sales and distribution channel initiative 
beginning in fiscal  we have been expanding our business by adding new equipment sales channels to our rental  leasing and used equipment sales offerings 
in addition to adding revenue and expanding our sales organization  we can capture related rental and lease opportunities and provide customers with a full range of equipment acquisition options 
our atp agreement with agilent  commencing in fiscal  gives us the exclusive right to sell agilent s more complex t m equipment to small to medium size customers who previously purchased directly from agilent in the united states and canada 
equipment pool expansion initiatives 
despite the global economic downturn  we have used our strong balance sheet to make significant equipment purchases to meet t m rental demand  support areas of potential growth and keep our equipment pool technologically up to date 
in response to increasing customer demand  we increased our purchases of equipment during fiscal by compared to fiscal  including million of equipment acquired in our purchase of the assets of telogy  llc telogy in march as a result  we have been able to expand and upgrade our equipment base with equipment that is limited in supply but growing in demand  enhancing our ability to meet the needs of a wide range of customers  as well as expand our equipment pool offerings in some related areas such as telecom and industrial products business 
vendor leasing initiative 
in fiscal  we began an initiative to develop a substantial worldwide t m leasing program by partnering with agilent  ixia  jdsu and other major manufacturers 
these relationships have expanded our leasing program and enhanced our ability to meet the needs of our customers by offering competitive finance and operating leases 
our markets and competition 
the north american general purpose test equipment rental market has generated in excess of million of annual rental and lease revenue in a normal economic environment  and is characterized by intense competition from several large competitors 
although no single competitor holds a dominant market share in north america  our primary competitors in the t m rental area include mcgrath rent corp  continental resources  test equity  and microlease plc 
we compete for rental business with microlease plc and livingston group ltd 
in europe and orix corporation in asia 
these entities also compete with us in leasing t m equipment  as do banks  vendors and other financing sources 
in addition  in selling our equipment  we may also compete with sales of new equipment by our suppliers  including agilent and tektronix  and their other distributors 
our competitors engage in aggressive pricing for both rentals and sales  as well as offering customers extended warranties in excess of the underlying manufacturers warranties and other services 
in order to maintain or increase our market share  we may choose to lower our prices  resulting in lower revenues and decreased profitability 
the market for the lease and rental of computers and servers is highly fragmented  although our principal competitors include smartsource computer audio visual rentals  rent a computer  icc rents  source one rentals  pc rentals  rentex and cre rentals 
the computer rental market has been characterized by intense competition that has lead to industry consolidation 
we acquired two competitors during the last fifteen years and smartsource  our largest competitor  has expanded primarily due to its eighteen acquisitions 
while we have focused on the rental of large quantities of computers to unique customers  smartsource concentrates more on audio visual and trade show technology rentals 
our backlog 
as of may   we had an order backlog of million  the result of sales in connection with our atp sales agreement 
there was no such backlog in fiscal we expect that a majority of the backlog will be delivered to customers within six months of our fiscal year end 
backlog represents the cumulative balance  at a given point in time  of recorded customer sales orders that have not yet been shipped or recognized as sales 
backlog is increased when an order is received  and backlog is decreased when we recognize sales 
although backlog consists of firm orders for which goods and services are yet to be provided  customers can  and sometimes do  terminate or modify these orders 
backlog  on any particular date  while indicative of short term revenue performance  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long term revenue performance

risk factors 
please carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties 
we believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward looking statements made by us 
the following risk factors are not the only risk factors that we face 
additional risks that we do not consider material  or of which we are not currently aware  may also have an adverse impact on us 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs or materializes 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline  and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment 
common stock price fluctuations our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
general factors 
we believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our stock have included announcements of developments related to our business  announcements concerning new products or enhancements in the equipment that we rent  or developments in our relationships with our customers  variations in our revenues  gross margins  earnings or other financial results from investors expectations  and fluctuations in results of our operations and general conditions in the economy  our market  and the markets served by our customers 
in addition  prices in the stock market have been volatile in recent years 
in many cases  the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
as a result  the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of our shares 
additionally  the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
in addition to the  shares outstanding as of august   as of such date  we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and conversion of our stock units previously granted under our equity incentive plans 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
fluctuations in operating results historically  our operating results have fluctuated  and we expect that fluctuations could continue in the future 
the fluctuations in our past results have resulted from many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the future  these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease 
timing of equipment purchases and sales and equipment pool management 
the profitability of our business depends in part on controlling the timing  pricing and mix of purchases and sales of equipment and on managing our equipment pool 
we seek to acquire new and used equipment at attractive prices  from which we feel we can make a profit as a result of a combination of renting and or selling that equipment 
we base expenditures for equipment purchases  sales and marketing and other items on our expectations of future customer demand 
in order to maximize overall profit from the rental  leasing  and sales of equipment  we manage our equipment pool on an on going basis by analyzing our product strategy for each specific equipment class in light of that equipment s historical and projected lifecycle 
in doing so  we compare our estimate of potential profit from rental with the potential profit from the product s immediate sale and replacement with new or other equipment 
our overall equipment management is complex and our equipment strategy can change during the equipment s lifetime based upon numerous factors  including the us and global economy  interest rates and new product launches 
our strategic equipment decisions are based on the following fundamentals our acquisition cost  our estimates of current and future market demand for rentals  our estimates of current and future supply of equipment  the book value of the equipment after depreciation and other impairment  our estimates of the effect of interest rates on rental and leasing fees as well as capital financing  and our estimates of the potential current and future sale prices of equipment 
however  historical trends are not necessarily indicative of future trends 
if our assumptions prove to be wrong  not only may our revenues fall short of our expectations  but we may not be able to adjust our inventory quickly enough to compensate for lower demand for one or more products in our inventory 
in addition  as demand for a product falls  we may have difficulty in selling any of our excess equipment at a favorable price or at all 
both of these factors can compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our stock 
risks associated with changing economic conditions 
the us economy and international markets that we serve are currently in a recession  which has resulted in more stringent credit requirements and reduced access to capital  and which may deepen and continue for the foreseeable future 
our customers historically have reduced their expenditures for electronic equipment during economic downturns 
accordingly  when the domestic and or international economy weakens  demand for our services declines 
a large part of our equipment pool is rented or leased to customers in the aerospace  defense  electronics and telecommunications industries 
continued slowdowns in the us and global economy  or one or more of these specific industries  resulting in lower demand and price pressure  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
in fact  in fiscal and fiscal  the us economy experienced a downturn and the core industries we serve were negatively impacted 
as a result  we experienced a decline in revenues  and we recorded a loss on impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
beginning in fiscal  the recession in the us and global economy resulted in reduced revenues and a decline in our operating results 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
regardless of the overall economic outlook domestically and globally  december  january and february typically reflect lower rental activity 
in addition  because february is a short month  revenue billing in that month is reduced 
we cannot predict whether these seasonal factors or their effects will change in the future 
the seasonal spending patterns of our customers are affected by factors such as weather  holiday and vacation considerations  and budgetary considerations 
additionally  our operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including remarketing activities  product announcements by manufacturers  economic conditions and variations in the financial mix of new rentals and leases 
the financial mix of new rentals and leases is a result of a combination of factors such as changes in customer demands and or requirements  new product announcements  price changes  changes in delivery dates  changes in maintenance policies and the pricing policies of equipment manufacturers  and price competition from other rental  leasing and finance companies 
other factors 
other factors that may affect our operating results include competitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets  changes in interest rates  our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  currency fluctuations and other risks of international operations  general economic conditions  and differences in the timing of our spending on acquiring equipment  renting or leasing that equipment and receiving revenues from our customers 
all or any of these and similar factors could result in our operating results differing substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
risks associated with technology changes if we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
technological advancements 
we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware  software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers 
the equipment we rent can be the subject of rapid technological developments  evolving customer demands and frequent new product announcements and enhancements 
if we fail to adequately anticipate or adapt to new technological developments or to recognize changing market conditions  our operating results and stock price could be materially and adversely affected 
expenses resulting from technological advancements 
as a result of technology developments  we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to acquire new equipment or invest in further staff education on operating and servicing the equipment we deliver to our customers 
further  we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technological changes for many reasons  including misjudging the impact of technological changes as well as financial  technological or other constraints 
if we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technological advancements or customer preferences  it would likely have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
introduction of new products and services 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and declining prices of certain products 
our operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to introduce new services and to control and or reduce costs on existing services 
whether we succeed in our new offerings depends on several factors such as proper identification of customer needs  our costs  timely completion and introduction of products and services as compared to our competitors  our ability to differentiate our equipment and services from our competitors  and market acceptance of our business 
risks associated with customer solvency if we do not collect on contracts with customers  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent or lease electronic equipment than owning that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere 
this can be particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the telecommunications industry 
however  some of our customers have liquidity issues  which have been compounded by the current economic recession  and ultimately cannot fulfill the terms of their agreements with us 
if we are not able to manage credit risk issues  or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time  our credit losses would increase above historical levels 
if this should occur  our results of operations and stock price may be materially and adversely affected 
competition if we do not effectively compete in our market  our operating results and stock price will be materially and adversely affected 
our industry is characterized by intense competition from several large competitors  some of which have access to greater financial and other resources than we do 
although no single competitor holds a dominant market share  we face competition from both established entities and new entries in the market 
our primary competitors in the north american t m rental area include mcgrath rent corp  continental resources  test equity and microlease plc 
we compete for rental business with microlease plc and livingston group ltd 
in europe and orix corporation in asia 
these entities also compete with us in leasing t m equipment  as do banks  vendors and other financing sources 
in addition  in selling our equipment  we may also compete with sales of new equipment by our suppliers  including agilent and tektronix  and their other distributors 
the market for the lease and rental of computers and servers is highly fragmented  although our principal competitors include smartsource computer audio visual rentals  rent a computer  icc rents  source one rentals  pc rentals  rentex and cre rentals 
the computer rental market has been characterized by intense competition that has lead to industry consolidation 
we acquired two competitors during the last fifteen years and smartsource  our largest competitor  has expanded primarily due to its eighteen acquisitions 
our competitors engage in aggressive pricing for both rentals and sales  as well as offering customers extended warranties in excess of the underlying manufacturers warranties and other services 
in order to maintain or increase our market share  we may choose to lower our prices  resulting in lower revenues and decreased profitability 
risks associated with international operations if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
currency risks 
we generate a meaningful portion of our revenues from international operations 
our contracts to supply equipment outside of the us are generally priced in local currency 
however  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results  and could result in exchange losses 
although we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates  we may not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations 
thus  exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
other risks associated with international operations 
additionally  our financial results may be adversely affected by other international risks  such as international political and economic conditions  changes in government regulation in various countries  trade barriers  difficulty in staffing our foreign sales and service centers  and in training and retaining foreign employees  issues relating to the repatriation of any profits  adverse tax consequences  and costs associated with expansion into new territories 
we expect to continue our international operations and that the revenues we derive from these activities will continue to be a meaningful portion of our total revenues 
if we do not anticipate and respond to the risks associated with international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with our manufacturers and suppliers if we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
about of our equipment portfolio at acquisition cost consists of general purpose t m instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as agilent and tektronix 
the remainder of our equipment pool consists of personal computers and workstations  which include personal computers from compaq  dell  ibm  apple  and toshiba and workstations primarily from sun microsystems and hewlett packard 
we depend on these manufacturers and suppliers to contract for our equipment 
if  in the future  we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms  we may not be able to meet our customers demands in a timely manner or for a price that generates a profit 
if this should occur  we can make no assurance that we will be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and stock price may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers  our senior managers and other key personnel  including  among others  our chief executive officer  daniel greenberg  our president  steven markheim  and our chief financial officer  craig jones 
the loss of these people  especially without advance notice  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
it is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel to accommodate growth and to replace personnel who leave 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  especially in technology industries  and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience to market  sell and service our equipment 
under these conditions  we could be unable to recruit  train  and retain employees 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
control by management and others senior management has significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions 
as of august   our executive officers and directors collectively own approximately of our common stock 
as of that date  i mr 
daniel greenberg  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock  and ii one other shareholder controls of our outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  these shareholders may have significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
these may include  for example  the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our corporate documents and the approval of mergers and sales of our assets 
risks associated with possible acquisitions and new business ventures if we cannot successfully implement any recent or future acquisitions or new business ventures  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
on occasion  we evaluate business opportunities that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
in fiscal  we acquired rush computer rentals  inc  a private company based in wallingford  connecticut that rents and sells a wide range of dp equipment 
in fiscal  we acquired certain assets and select post closing liabilities of telogy  a private company headquartered in union city  california  and a leading provider of electronic t m equipment 
in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with agilent to sell new t m equipment through our new atp sales agreement in the us and canada  resulting in the hiring of additional sales and support staff 
we could decide to pursue one or more other opportunities by acquisition or internal development 
acquisitions and new business ventures  both domestic and foreign  involve many risks  including the difficulty of integrating acquired operations and personnel with our existing operations  the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services  the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures  our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  and the loss of key employees of an acquired operation 
in addition  an acquisition or new business venture could adversely impact cash flows and or operating results  and dilute shareholder interests  for many reasons  including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture  and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current shareholders 
additionally  we have implemented various new business ventures in the past  and not all of such ventures have been successful 
the risks associated with acquisitions and new business ventures could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with fluctuating interest rates interest rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our leasing yields generally directly correlate with market interest rates when interest rates are higher  our leasing terms incorporate a higher financing charge 
however  in times of relatively lower interest rates our financing charges also decrease  and some of our customers choose to purchase new equipment  rather than leasing equipment at all 
lower leasing yields are reflected in lower rental and lease revenues 
anti takeover provisions the anti takeover provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and in california law could materially and adversely impact the value of our common stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and california law could  together or separately  discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might benefit our shareholders 
this may adversely impact the interests of our shareholders with respect to a potential acquisition and may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of common stock 
some examples of these provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws are the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock  without prior shareholder approval  and certain limitations of the rights of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders
