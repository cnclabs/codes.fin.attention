item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under risk factors in item a 
all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix develops  manufactures  and markets non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph 
bph is a disease caused by the proliferation of non cancerous cells in the prostate gland  better known as an enlarged prostate 
this disease affects more than million men worldwide and presents itself with clinical symptoms including nocturia night voiding  urinary obstruction  frequency  urgency  and incomplete voiding 
any or all of these symptoms can negatively affect the quality of life among bph sufferers 
without proper treatment  bph can cause substantial upper and lower urinary tract dysfunction including recurrent bladder infections  bladder decompensation and kidney failure 
we market our control units under the targis and coolwave names and our procedure kits under the ctc advance  targis and prostaprobe names 
all systems utilize the company s cooled thermotherapy technology  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without general anesthesia or intravenous sedation and can be performed in a urologist s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe that cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph with results clinically superior to medication and without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the continued adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy will be keys to maintaining such reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive cooled thermotherapy treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
a majority of our cooled thermotherapy treatments are performed in the urologist s office  but our treatments can be performed in an ambulatory surgery center asc or in a hospital outpatient setting 
the national average reimbursement rate in the physician office setting which is a global fee paid entirely to the urologist is currently  for our cooled thermotherapy treatment 
the cms published the physician fee schedule pfs final rule for calendar on october  since publication  congress has acted four times to temporarily adjust the medicare reimbursement for all physician payments 
these adjustments are to offset broader prescribed reimbursement cuts to medicare driven by the sustainable growth rate sgr formula 
the current temporary adjustment expires november  if congress fails to act to extend the temporary adjustment to the medicare physician fee schedule  the level of medicare reimbursement in the physician office setting for cooled thermotherapy will decline to  while congress has acted four times since the publication of the final rule to delay the impacts from the sgr  we do not know when nor if these adjustments will be extended for the final month of calendar year and calendar year we are monitoring these developments closely and will continue to execute on our active reimbursement strategy 
urologists who perform cooled thermotherapy procedures in an asc are reimbursed under the two part system in which the asc receives a fixed fee of  in the pfs as compared to  in  while the urologist performing the treatment is reimbursed currently 
in the hospital outpatient setting  which is not affected by changes in the pfs conversion factor  the national average total reimbursement is  for calendar year compared to  in calendar year in the hospital outpatient setting the urologist performing the treatment is reimbursed private insurance companies and hmos make their own determinations regarding coverage and reimbursement based upon usual and customary fees 
to date  we have received coverage and reimbursement from private insurance companies and hmos throughout the united states 
we intend to continue our efforts to gain coverage and reimbursement across the united states 
there can be no assurance that we will receive favorable coverage nor reimbursement determinations for cooled thermotherapy from these payers or that amounts reimbursed to urologists for performing cooled thermotherapy procedures will be sufficient to encourage urologists to use urologix product and service offerings 

table of contents as a result of recently enacted federal health care reform legislation  substantial changes are anticipated in the united states health care system 
such legislation includes numerous provisions affecting the delivery of health care services  the financing of health care costs  reimbursement of health care providers and the legal obligations of health insurers  providers and employers 
these provisions are currently slated to take effect at specified times over approximately the next decade 
the federal health care reform legislation did not directly affect our fiscal year financial statements and we do not expect this legislation to affect our financial results for fiscal year our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is to i educate both patients and urologists on the benefits of cooled thermotherapy as an effective  safe and cost effective treatment option that can provide superior clinical outcomes with long term durability compared to other treatment options  including bph medication  ii increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by urologists who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  iii increase the number of urologists who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients  and iv provide more urologists with access to cooled thermotherapy through the use of our own cooled thermotherapy mobile service or third party mobile providers in the united states 
in the future  we expect to increase our investment in research and development and clinical trials to continue to improve our products and our therapy 
these investments are intended to broaden our product offering and expand the clinical evidence supporting our proprietary cooled thermotherapy treatment for bph 
in april at the american urological association annual meeting  we launched our newest cooled thermotherapy treatment catheter  the ctc advance short short antenna length  and had two separate presentations of our clinical data 
the presentations highlighted our year durability data and the ability of urologists using our system to customize the treatment for patients 
critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy control units with customers free of charge under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use  and also provide access to cooled thermotherapy treatments via our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
we retain title to the control units placed with our customers for evaluation and longer term use 
these programs  as well as our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue for the free use of our cooled thermotherapy control units are bundled with the sale of single use treatment catheters and are considered a single unit of accounting 
revenue from the bundled sales is recognized when the single use treatment catheters are shipped to our customers 
revenue from our mobile service is recognized upon treatment of the patient 
revenue for extended warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and specific customer based circumstances 
should actual sales returns differ from our estimates  revisions to the sales return reserve would be required 
sales and use taxes are reported on a net basis  excluding them from revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
accounts receivable are written off after management determines they are uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventories we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if estimated fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
in fiscal year  we did not generate positive cash flows from operations 
if our long term future plans do not yield positive cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  we would anticipate possible future impairments of those assets 
considerable management judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows and other factors affecting the valuation of long lived assets  including the operating and macroeconomic factors that may affect them 
we use historical financial information  internal plans and projections and industry information in making such estimates 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
we have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination 
we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
at june   we carried a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation the company uses the fair value recognition provisions of the revised authoritative guidance for equity based compensation and applies the modified prospective method in determining stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period which corresponds to the vesting period 
options and restricted stock awards typically vest percent after the first year of service with the remaining vesting th each month thereafter 
generally  options granted to non employee directors are immediately exercisable at the date of grant while restricted stock awards generally vest after one year 
options are priced based on the closing price of a share of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model  we use historical data to estimate expected volatility and the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the range of these assumptions and the range of option pricing and number of options granted at the different grant dates will impact our calculation of the fair value of the awards and will therefore impact the amount of expense reflected in our statement of operations for any given period 
fair value for restricted stock is based on the market price on the day of grant 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased percent to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in sales from fiscal year is primarily due to increased orders for procedure kits as well as an increase in the number of cooled thermotherapy mobile treatments performed 
during fiscal year  revenue from catheter sales to direct accounts constituted percent of sales compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while catheter sales to third party mobiles constituted percent of revenue in the current fiscal year compared to percent in fiscal year revenue derived from the urologix mobile service constituted percent of total sales in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the remaining two percent of our sales in fiscal year were from sales of our warranty service contracts  non kit items and other miscellaneous items 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy control units and single use treatment catheters  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year increased to million or percent from million in fiscal year this increase in cost of goods sold is attributed to the percent increase in sales year over year 
this overall increase was offset by a lower manufacturing expense per unit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the six percentage point increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is a result of lower manufacturing expense per unit due to higher production volume of our treatment catheters  which provided a larger base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  the delivery cost per treatment for our mobile service decreased by from the prior year 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of a reversal of  for a sales tax accrual in the first quarter of fiscal year and a net increase of  for commissions and bonuses achieved during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in freight and shipping costs  a decrease in audit and professional fees of  and a decrease in our stock based compensation expense of  due to the lower grant date fair value of options in recent periods 
in addition  as part of the company s expense reduction efforts  meeting expense decreased by  and recruiting  insurance and travel expense decreased by  research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million for fiscal year  a decline of percent from million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development is due to a  decrease in consulting and legal fees  a  decrease in payroll expenses due to employee turnover and a  decrease in expenses associated with clinical studies  offset by a  increase in temporary labor and outside services 
amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets remained consistent at  in fiscal years and this amortization expense relates to the amortization of our remaining customer base intangible asset over its remaining useful life of years 

table of contents net interest income due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in fiscal year  net interest income was less than  and is  therefore  not included on the face of the income statement compared to  in fiscal year provision for income taxes we recorded  of income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june  the  of income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  was the result of recording an income tax benefit of  related to a net operating loss carry back claim to recapture alternative minimum tax paid during fiscal years and and  related to research and development credits 
this income tax benefit was partially offset by the recording of  of state income tax expense 
the  of income tax expense for fiscal year june  was the result of the recording of  of state income tax expense partially offset by  of an income tax benefit related to research and development credits 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in sales from fiscal year is primarily due to reduced orders for procedure kits as well as a reduction in the number of cooled thermotherapy mobile treatments performed due to fewer accounts treating  partially offset by an increase in orders for procedure kits to our third party mobiles  as well as an increase in the mobile service asp 
during fiscal year  revenue from catheter sales to direct accounts constituted percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal year  while catheter sales to third party mobiles constituted percent of revenue in fiscal year compared to percent in fiscal year revenue derived from the urologix mobile service constituted percent of total sales in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior year 
the remaining three percent of our sales in fiscal year were from sales of our control units and warranty service contracts 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased to million or percent from million in fiscal year this decrease in cost of goods sold is a result of the percent decrease in sales year over year  as well as fiscal year non recurring charges related to the impairment of developed technologies of  and a  provision for prostaprobe inventories  purchase commitments and warranties as a result of the projected decline in sales as a result of the decision to end of life the prostatron product line 
these decreases were partially offset by higher manufacturing expense per unit and increased unabsorbed manufacturing expense due to lower production volume in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the four percentage point decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal is a result of higher manufacturing expense per unit and lower production volume of our treatment catheters  which provide a smaller base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  the number of mobile unit treatments as a percentage of sales increased  which have lower overall margins 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased million or percent to million from million in fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of a  increase to our sales tax accrual in fiscal year  of which approximately  was reversed in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of new information obtained which indicated that we would not owe as much sales tax as previously estimated 
in addition  the decrease in expenses from fiscal year to reflects a  decrease in legal and audit fees  a  decrease in consulting and professional fees due to certain one time expenses in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal  a  decrease in commission expense due to lower sales  a  decrease in stock option expense due to lower grant date fair values  a  decrease in advertising and promotion expense  a  decrease in wages and benefits as a result of severance accruals recorded during fiscal year for former company executives  as well as smaller decreases in several other areas 
much of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal year was a result of our continuing efforts to manage expenses 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million  or percent for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease in research and development is due to a  decrease in product testing and project materials as we launched our newest catheter  ctc advance at the end of the prior year 
in addition  wages and benefits decreased by approximately  as a result of a reduction in headcount 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in consulting expenses of  as a result of research and development employee turnover 
amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the decrease in amortization and impairment expense is the result of the implementation of an end of life plan in fiscal year for the prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
as a result of this plan  in fiscal year we wrote off the remaining balance of our trademark intangible asset of  as well as recorded an additional write down of the customer base intangible asset of  due to a decrease in projected sales of this end of life product line 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal year decreased to  from  in fiscal year the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded  of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to a million income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  the  of income tax expense for fiscal year was the result of  of state income tax expense partially offset by  of an income tax benefit related to research and development credits 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  is a result of a million reversal of the deferred tax liability balance related to goodwill which was no longer necessary after the impairment of goodwill at december  this was partially offset by  of tax expense mainly related to state income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our net operating loss of million in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year  we used million of cash from operating activities compared to million in fiscal year primarily as a result of the improvement in the net operating loss 
the net loss included non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization expense and  of stock based compensation expense 
changes in asset and liability balances used  of operating cash flow for the year as a result of an increase in inventory levels of  and a decrease in accrued expenses and deferred income of  partially offset by a decrease in other assets of  cash used for investing activities we used  for investing activities as a result of the purchase of property and equipment to support our mobile  office and manufacturing operations  as well as a slight increase in our intellectual property 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year  we generated  from financing activities as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we believe our million in cash and cash equivalents at june  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs beyond the next months 
in addition  we believe the majority of our cash equivalents are secure as they are backed by united states government treasuries 
contractual commitments we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use of our cooled thermotherapy control units in addition to purchase options  as well as grow our mobile service which provides urologists and patients with efficient access to our cooled thermotherapy control units on a pre scheduled basis 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately  of control units used in evaluation or longer term use programs and units used in our company owned mobile service 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance these programs 
future contractual commitments that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands building and equipment leases off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting standards information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in note to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash equivalent instruments 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair value of these instruments  as our investments are variable rate investments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and was not materially different from the quarter end carrying value 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents instruments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
