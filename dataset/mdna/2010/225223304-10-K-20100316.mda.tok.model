overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing hpc systems  commonly known as supercomputers  and provide engineering services related to hpc systems and solutions 
our supercomputer systems provide capability and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific  economic  engineering and national security computing problems 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the hpc market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect  packaging and system software capabilities that enable our systems to provide efficient and high sustained performance at scale that is  to continue to increase performance as our systems grow in size 
purpose built for the supercomputer market  our higher end systems balance highly capable processors  highly scalable system software and very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities 
our current plans are based on gaining market share in the high end supercomputer market segment  extending our technology leadership  maintaining our focus on execution and profitability and expanding our addressable market through broadening of our engineering services offerings  specifically our custom engineering practices  and selling our new cray cx and cray xtm systems 
summary of results revenue increased by million in compared to  with a million decrease in product revenue fully offset by a million increase in service revenue 
the decrease in product revenue was principally due to 
table of contents lower cray xt system sales as product revenue benefited from approximately million from a single transaction at oak ridge national laboratory 
the increase in service revenue was primarily due to increased engineering services revenue  primarily from our custom engineering initiative 
loss from operations decreased in to a loss of million compared to a loss from operations of million in total gross profit decreased million in from due to lower product revenue and gross profit margin and a million increase in excess and obsolescence inventory expense offset in part by increased gross profit from service revenue 
core operating expenses operating expenses less restructuring  severance and impairment charges increased million due primarily to higher net research and development expenses due to lower reimbursements  principally from our darpa phase iii program 
our loss from operations included a goodwill impairment charge of million 
net cash provided by operations during was million principally due to lower accounts receivable and inventory balances 
net cash used in operations during was million 
market overview and challenges significant trends in the hpc industry include the commoditization of hpc hardware  particularly processors and interconnect systems  the growing commoditization of software  including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software  supercomputing with many core commodity processors causing increasing scalability requirements  electrical power requirements becoming a design constraint and driver in total cost of ownership determinations  increased micro architectural diversity  including many core processors with vector extensions and growing experimentation with accelerators  as the rate of per core performance has decreased  and data needs growing faster than computational needs 
several of these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of lower bandwidth cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd and others combined with commercially available commodity networking and other components  particularly in the middle and lower portions of the hpc market 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and price peak performance is often the dominant factor in hpc procurements outside of the high end supercomputer market segment 
vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements  even at times in larger procurements where time to solution is of significant importance 
in the markets for the largest systems  those costing significantly in excess of million  the use of commodity processors and networking components can result in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication capability 
with the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to quad core and many core processors  these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications 
we and other vendors have also begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types  such as field programmable gate arrays and graphics processing units  in order to increase computational power  further complicating programming models 
in addition  with increasing scale  bandwidth and processor core counts  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
to position ourselves to meet the market s demanding needs  we concentrate our research and development efforts on the interconnect  system software and packaging capabilities that enable our supercomputers to perform at scale that is  to continue to increase actual performance as systems grow ever larger in size 
we have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies 
further  we offer unique capabilities in high speed  high bandwidth system interconnect design  compiler technology  system software and packaging capabilities 
we believe our experience and capabilities across each of these fronts are becoming ever more important  especially in larger procurements 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger many core processors 
table of contents become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems 
in addition  we intend to expand our addressable market by leveraging our technologies and customer base  the cray brand and industry trends by introducing complementary products and services to new and existing customers  as demonstrated by our emphasis on custom engineering projects and the introduction of our cray cx family and cray xtm and cray xtm systems 
key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
revenue growth is the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the markets we address 
the introduction of the cray xt family and our longer term product roadmap  including our intel initiative and our baker system  are efforts to increase product revenue 
we also plan to increase our engineering services offerings  specifically our custom engineering initiative  and market new products  such as the cray cx and cray xtm and successor systems  to increase revenue 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross profit margin 
our total gross profit margin and our product gross profit margin for were and  respectively  which reflect decreases from the levels which were each  due primarily to a million charge in the third quarter of for estimated excess inventory from a last time buy in we focus on maintaining and improving our product gross profit margin over the long term  which we believe is best achieved through product differentiation 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  the level of recognized co funding for research and development and contracted third party research and development services 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
core operating expenses  which excludes restructuring  severance and impairment charges  for were approximately million more than due primarily to increased net research and development expense due to lower recognized reimbursement amounts resulting from delays in completing a darpa co funded development contract amendment and passing associated milestones 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue and new contracts  our cash position also varies from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
sustained profitability over annual periods is our primary objective  which should improve our cash position 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules in part iv of this annual report should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in 
table of contents some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 
additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the fair value determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing of long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value  calculation of deferred income tax assets  including our ability to utilize such assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to our customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no significant unfulfilled obligations exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue in our consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are our statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services 
when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the element could be sold separately  the fair value of the undelivered element is established  and in cases with any general right of return  our performance with respect to any undelivered element is within our control and probable 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element as the elements would not be considered a separate unit of accounting and revenue would be recognized as described below under our product or service revenue recognition policies 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the sales price as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
products 
we recognize revenue from sales of our products  other than the cray cx system  upon customer acceptance of the system  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract that affect the customer s final acceptance  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is typically required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of our cray cx products are generally recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
project revenue 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex hpc systems to a customer s specifications is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components or services 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and gross profit on a cumulative basis 
to the extent 
table of contents the estimate of total costs to complete the contract indicates a loss  such amount is recognized in full in the period that the determination is made 
services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of fair value 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we consider fiscal funding clauses as contingencies for the recognition of revenue until the funding is virtually assured 
revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand of our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to inventory in excess of estimated future demand 
the largest portion of this write down related to a cray custom made component used on the cray xt products known as the cray seastar interconnect purchased in under a last time buy procurement 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  before our million valuation allowance  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
our net deferred tax assets relate to certain foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
during the third quarter of  we reversed million of the valuation allowance on certain deferred income tax assets in japan as we concluded it was more likely than not these deferred income tax assets would be realized 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development costs include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features and expenses related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from third parties 
we may also enter into arrangements whereby we make advance  non refundable payments to a vendor to perform certain research and development services 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor s estimated performance period 
during the third quarter of  we amended a vendor agreement to settle outstanding performance issues 
we had made advance payments of million to the vendor 
the amendment calls for us to receive a refund of million of amounts previously paid to the vendor and the right to receive rebates on future purchases 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the refund was million  which we expect to receive in the first half of we have estimated that the fair value of the rebate right is million which has been classified in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
no gain or loss was recorded as a result of this amendment 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as such  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed as in our third and fourth quarters of or the us government has not funded an agreement 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense  based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation by estimating the fair value of share based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued guidance now codified in fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities  which is designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
the guidance is effective for periods ending after june  accordingly  we adopted this guidance for our quarter ended june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the provisions of fasb asc topic will require additional disclosures with respect to the fair value of our investments when there are unrealized losses that are not deemed other than temporarily impaired 
in may  the fasb issued guidance now codified in fasb asc topic  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for  and disclosures of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after june  accordingly  we adopted these provisions of fasb asc topic during the quarter ended june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the provisions of fasb asc topic resulted in additional disclosures with respect to subsequent events 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued guidance now codified in fasb asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap 
fasb asc topic does not change current gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative gaap by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents have been superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the fasb codification is now considered non authoritative 
these provisions of fasb asc topic are effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and  accordingly  are effective for our current fiscal reporting period 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations  but will impact our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre codification standards 
on the effective date of this guidance  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  and all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance in asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which replaces fair value in the revenue allocation guidance  as the allocation of revenue will be based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the amendments in asu are effective for revenue transactions entered into during fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial results nor would it have had a material impact had the guidance been adopted on january  in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the guidance in asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are excluded from the guidance applicable to software revenue recognition 
the amendments in asu are effective for revenue transactions entered into during fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial results nor would it have had a material impact had the guidance been adopted on january  results of operations revenue and gross profit our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross profit percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross profit service gross profit percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross profit total gross profit percentage

reimbursed research and development decreased million in compared to due to lower amounts recognized related to our darpa phase iii project  principally the result in delays in our darpa co funded development contract amendment and related contract milestones 
during  we entered into discussions with darpa to amend the phase iii agreement 
in february  the company and darpa amended the phase iii agreement 
as with the previous contract  we expect to receive reimbursement after the achievement of a series of pre defined milestones culminating in the delivery of a prototype system in consistent with this change  certain deliverables have been eliminated from the contract  reducing the overall scope and cost of the project 
the remaining amount of the milestones under the contract has been reduced by million to million 
as of december   we had received million of reimbursement under the darpa phase iii agreement 
during march  we received a reimbursement of million for a milestone we passed in the first quarter of pursuant to the recently amended contract  we are required to spend million on our darpa phase iii project in order to receive the full million of co funding 
in  gross research and development expenses increased million from levels due to increased spending on the darpa phase iii project  which was partially offset by decreased spending on our cray xth system formerly known as our blackwidow project 
increases in variable pay expense of million were a significant driver of the overall increase

for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to million of cash paid to repurchase certain of our notes 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities included million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan 
over the next twelve months  we expect our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory associated with certain large scale product deliveries and spare parts  particularly those associated with our planned baker system deliveries  outside engineering expenses  particularly as we continue development of our cray xt and successor systems and internally fund a portion of the expenses pursuant to the darpa hpcs award and the acquisition of property and equipment 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases unrecognized income tax benefits total contractual cash obligations in july  we amended our line of credit agreement to increase the maximum line of credit to million and extend the maturity date to june  as of december   we were eligible to use the million 
in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products and to engage in custom engineering projects  with adequate gross profit 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in reestablishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis

we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in 
table of contents interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a percent change in interest rates would not be significant 
the table below presents fair values and related weighted average interest rate by investment class at december  in thousands  except for percentages 
the average maturity of these investments is less than six months with a credit quality range of a 
weighted averaged interest fair value maturities rate treasury bills foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced based on us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we often sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we had entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a partial natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million
