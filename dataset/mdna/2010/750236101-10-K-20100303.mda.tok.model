item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies reserve for losses of this annual report on form k 
losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio or financial guaranty portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty 
the gses  rating agencies and state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries 
these capital requirements include risk to capital ratios  risk based capital measures and surplus requirements that limit the amount of insurance that our insurance subsidiaries may write 
sixteen states currently have a statutory or regulatory requirement limiting a mortgage insurer s risk to capital ratio to to as a result of the significant losses we experienced in our mortgage insurance business  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio grew from to at december  to to at december   after giving effect to the contribution of our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business during the third quarter of based on current and expected future trends  we believe that we may continue to incur material losses in our mortgage insurance business 
the ultimate amount of losses will depend in part on general economic conditions and other factors  including the health of credit markets  home prices and unemployment rates  all of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
in the absence of additional new capital or capital relief through reinsurance or otherwise  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio is expected to increase during and could reach to before the end of the year if losses are materially worse than our current expectations 
we  along with others in our industry  are seeking regulatory changes or relief in those states that impose a to risk to capital requirement  primarily through new legislation or other means by which the insurance regulator in these states is granted discretionary authority to waive the to risk to capital requirement 
although these efforts have been successful in some states  it is uncertain whether regulatory changes or relief will be obtained in the remaining states in sufficient time to avoid a breach of the to limitation in these states 
further  in those states that currently allow for discretionary authority  there can be no assurance that the regulators in these states will exercise their discretion to permit us to write new business in the event that we exceed the to limitation  how long such regulators may allow any waiver of this requirement to exist or what  if any  other requirements may be imposed 
moreover  in those states that do not have a capital adequacy 
table of contents requirement in the form of a to limitation  it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if we failed to meet the capital adequacy requirement established by another state 
accordingly  if we fail to meet the capital adequacy requirements in one or more states  radian guaranty could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which we do business 
we are actively managing radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio by exploring alternatives to address our mortgage insurance capital needs  including potentially raising capital through one or more private or public offerings of debt or equity securities and by freeing up capital for use through liquidation of certain of our investments and through reinsurance or other risk transfer arrangements 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this annual report on form k 
we cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will embark upon or we will be successful in implementing any of these alternatives  many of which require regulatory and other approvals  or whether the capital or capital relief obtained through such alternatives will be sufficient to maintain our risk to capital ratio at or below to any future equity offerings could be dilutive to our existing stockholders  could result in a decrease in the price of our common stock  or could result in the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock 
we are also preparing  if necessary  to write new first lien mortgage insurance business through our wholly owned subsidiary  amerin guaranty  in those states that continue to impose a to risk to capital requirement 
we have received preliminary approval from the pennsylvania department of insurance to use amerin guaranty as a first lien mortgage insurance provider and are in the process of redomesticating amerin guaranty from illinois to pennsylvania for this purpose 
however  before amerin guaranty may write first lien mortgage insurance  we will need to add sufficient capital to amerin guaranty either from internal resources or from new capital and also will need to seek and obtain necessary regulatory or other approvals  including from the gses 
amerin guaranty is currently prohibited from writing new insurance business in six states without the addition of new capital 
we cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be successful in sufficiently capitalizing amerin guaranty or whether we will obtain the necessary approvals for implementing this alternative 
if radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio were to exceed to  state insurance regulators might limit the amount of new insurance business that radian guaranty may write or prohibit radian guaranty from writing new insurance altogether in their respective states  including those states that do not currently impose a to limitation 
in addition  the gses and our other customers may decide not to conduct new business with radian guaranty or reduce current business levels while its risk to capital ratio remained at elevated levels 
this could ultimately result in a loss of radian guaranty s eligibility with the gses 
the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business would likely be significantly diminished if radian guaranty was prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business it could write  especially in the event we are unable to execute on our strategy for writing new first lien mortgage insurance through amerin guaranty 
in addition  any restriction on radian guaranty s ability to continue to write new insurance would likely harm our ability to attract new capital 
we and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive  detailed regulation  principally designed for the protection of our insured policyholders  rather than for the benefit of investors  by the insurance departments in the various states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
insurance laws vary from state to state  but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business  including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company s ability to write new business 
given the significant losses incurred by many insurers in the mortgage and financial guaranty industries  our insurance subsidiaries have been subject to heightened scrutiny by insurance regulators 
we are currently in close communication with certain insurance regulatory authorities 
additionally  the hkia has directed radian insurance to continue to maintain sufficient assets in hong kong to cover its potential liabilities on insured loans 
table of contents in hong kong 
in light of current market conditions and ongoing losses in our insurance subsidiaries  insurance departments in the jurisdictions noted above or in other jurisdictions could impose restrictions or requirements that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses 
the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty depends  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio 
during the third quarter of  radian group contributed its ownership interest in radian asset assurance to radian guaranty 
while this reorganization provided radian guaranty with substantial regulatory capital  it also makes the capital adequacy of our mortgage insurance business dependent  to a significant degree  on the performance of our financial guaranty business 
if the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  including if we are required to establish one or more significant statutory reserves as a result of defaults in our insured obligations  the regulatory capital of radian guaranty also would be negatively impacted 
any decrease in the capital support derived from our financial guaranty business could  therefore  negatively impact the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business  and potentially lead to our inability to continue to write new mortgage insurance business 
see our financial guaranty portfolio has experienced deterioration as a result of general erosion in credit markets and the overall economy and is susceptible to further deterioration and we face risks associated with our financial guaranty insurance customers and our second to pay liabilities from these entities 
as of december   radian asset assurance maintained a statutory surplus of approximately billion and total claims paying resources of approximately billion 
we expect our financial guaranty business to issue significant dividends to radian guaranty over time as our existing financial guaranty portfolio matures and the exposure is reduced 
the timing and amount of these cash infusions will depend on the dividend capacity of our financial guaranty business  which is governed by new york insurance laws 
if our financial guaranty exposure is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture of insured business from our primary financial guaranty reinsurance customers or otherwise  we may have the ability to issue dividends to radian guaranty more quickly and in greater amounts 
if  however  the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  our financial guaranty statutory surplus could be reduced and our financial guaranty business would likely have less capacity to issue dividends to radian guaranty  and could be restricted from issuing dividends altogether 
our financial guaranty portfolio has experienced deterioration as a result of general erosion in credit markets and the overall economy and is susceptible to further deterioration 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of business results financial guaranty credit performance  in item of part ii below  we have experienced credit deterioration in our financial guaranty portfolio as a result of general deterioration in credit markets and the overall economy 
in particular  we have experienced credit deterioration within our insured portfolio of trups cdos 
for our cdo of abs transaction with million in net par outstanding as of december   we currently expect to begin paying claims in respect of interest shortfalls in upon our initial claim payment obligation  the statutory capital of radian asset assurance and consequently radian guaranty would be reduced by an amount equal to the present value of our expected future net losses net of taxes on this transaction 
see risk in force net par outstanding financial guaranty risk in 
table of contents force net par outstanding structured finance insured cdo portfolio risk in force net par outstanding financial guaranty for additional information regarding this cdo of abs transaction and certain circumstances where we may be obligated to pay outstanding principal prior to the legal final maturity date of our trups cdos 
while we have sought to underwrite our insured credits with levels of subordination designed to protect us from loss in the event of poor performance of the underlying collateral  we cannot be certain that such levels of subordination will protect us from future material losses in light of the significantly higher rates of delinquency and losses currently being observed within our insured credits 
we have guaranteed structured finance obligations that expose us to a variety of complex credit risks and indirectly to market  political and other risks beyond those that generally apply to financial guarantees of public finance obligations 
we have insured and reinsured certain asset backed transactions and securitizations secured by one or a few classes of assets  such as residential mortgages  auto loans and leases  credit card receivables and other consumer assets  both funded and synthetic 
we have also insured obligations under cds  including cdos of several asset classes  such as corporate debt  trups  rmbs  cmbs and other abs obligations 
we continue to have exposure to trade credit reinsurance which is currently in run off  which protects sellers of goods under certain circumstances against nonpayment of their accounts receivable 
losses associated with our structured finance and trade credit reinsurance businesses are difficult to predict accurately and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results  especially given the current economic disruption 
in addition to our structured finance risk  we have significant exposure to public finance obligations that are susceptible to default in an economic downturn 
historically  our financial guaranty public finance business has focused on smaller  regional  lower investment grade issuers and structures that were uneconomical for most of the larger  higher rated financial guarantors to insure 
as a result  we have greater exposure than other monoline financial guarantors to sectors such as healthcare and long term care and education that historically have had higher default rates than other public finance sectors 
these credits  which generally cover smaller  more rural and specialized issuers  tend to be lower rated and more susceptible to default in an economic downturn 
we face risks associated with our financial guaranty insurance customers and our second to pay liabilities from these entities 
as a result of rating agency downgrades of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries financial strength ratings  all of our unaffiliated primary reinsurance customers in our financial guaranty reinsurance business currently have the right to take back or recapture an aggregate of billion of business previously ceded to us under their reinsurance agreements with us 
while our treaties with our primary reinsurance customers do not permit our reinsurance customers to selectively recapture business previously ceded to us under their treaties  because we have entered into multiple treaties with each customer it is possible that a customer may choose to recapture business only under those treaties that they perceive as covering less risky portions of our reinsurance portfolio 
this could potentially leave us with risk that is more concentrated in troubled asset classes 
our reinsurance customers are primarily responsible for surveillance  loss mitigation and salvage on the risks that they cede to us 
some of these customers are experiencing financial difficulties  and therefore  may be less willing to or capable of performing these tasks to the extent necessary to minimize potential losses and or maximize potential salvage on the credits we reinsure 
due to their current financial difficulties  they may have different incentives to eliminate long term liabilities at a current discount than we do 
we generally do not have direct access to the insured obligation or the right to perform our own loss mitigation or salvage work on these transactions 
we also have limited visibility with respect to the performance of many of the obligations we reinsure 
see if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty businesses are incorrect  we may be required to take unexpected charges to income and could hurt our capital position below 
in addition  our primary reinsurance customers may delegate their loss adjustment functions to third parties  the cost of which would then be proportionally allocated to us and any other reinsurers for the insured transaction 
accordingly  the losses and loss adjustment expenses allocated to us on our reinsured risks may be significantly higher than otherwise would have been the case if we were responsible for 
table of contents surveillance  loss mitigation and salvage for these risks 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
approximately billion or of radian asset assurance s net par reinsurance exposure outstanding as of december   was ceded from primary insurer customers that are subsidiaries of one holding company 
consequently  such financial guaranty reinsurance is now dependent upon the surveillance and loss mitigation abilities of primary insurers under this one holding company 
we have insured several transactions on a second to pay basis  meaning that we are obligated to pay claims in these transactions only to the extent that another insurer fails to pay such a policy claim 
consequently  if the conservator for an insolvent financial guarantor rejects payment of all or a portion of a claim  we may be required to pay all or a portion of such claim 
because many insurers are currently experiencing significant financial difficulties  the likelihood of our having to pay a claim on our second to pay transactions has increased 
in  two of the companies that are the primary obligors on certain of the transactions for which we have provided second to pay protection  syncora guarantee inc and financial guaranty insurance company fgic  suspended all claims payments following orders by the nyid 
however  to date  we have not been obligated to pay claims on any of these transactions 
because most of the mortgage loans that we insure are sold to freddie mac and fannie mae  changes in their charters or business practices could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business 
freddie mac and fannie mae are the beneficiaries of the majority of our mortgage insurance policies 
freddie mac s and fannie mae s federal charters generally prohibit them from purchasing any mortgage with a loan amount that exceeds of a home s value  unless that mortgage is insured by a qualified insurer or the mortgage seller retains at least a participation in the loan or agrees to repurchase the loan in the event of a default 
as a result  high ltv mortgages purchased by freddie mac or fannie mae generally are insured with private mortgage insurance 
changes in the charters or business practices of freddie mac or fannie mae could reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value 
in particular  freddie mac and fannie mae may have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase see we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise below  alter the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law  require private mortgage insurers to perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are in default  and influence a mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage 
some of freddie mac s and fannie mae s more recent programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required  and they have the ability to further reduce coverage requirements  which could reduce the amount of mortgage insurance purchased and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
for a number of years  the gses have had programs under which lenders could choose  for certain loans  a mortgage insurance coverage percentage that was only the minimum required by the gse s charter  with the gses paying a lower price for these loans charter coverage 
the gses have also had programs under which  for certain loans  they would accept a level of mortgage insurance above the requirements of their charters  but below their standard coverage without any decrease in the purchase price they would pay for these loans reduced coverage 
in september  fannie mae announced that  effective january   it would expand broadly the types of loans eligible for charter coverage  and also that it would eliminate its reduced 
table of contents coverage program in the second quarter of to the extent lenders selling loans to fannie mae chose charter coverage for loans that we insure  our revenues would likely be reduced 
the gses business practices may be impacted by their results of operations as well as legislative or regulatory changes governing their operations 
in july  an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the gses was enacted 
the new provisions  contained within hera  encompass substantially all of the gses operations 
this new law abolished the former regulator for the gses and created a new  stronger regulator  the fhfa  in addition to other oversight reforms 
in september  the fhfa was appointed as the conservator of the gses to control and direct the operations of the gses 
the appointment of a conservator may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the gses will be changed in ways that may have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  if the private mortgage insurance industry does not have the ability  due to capital constraints  to continue to write sufficient business to meet the needs of the gses  the gses may seek alternatives other than private mortgage insurance to conduct their business 
the appointment of a conservator also increases the likelihood that the us congress will examine the role and purpose of the gses in the domestic housing market and potentially make certain structural and other changes to the gses 
it is uncertain when such changes could be proposed  which could be as early as spring of  and what the proposals would entail  which could include the abolishment of the gses and the replacement of the gses with a yet to be determined new system 
although we believe that private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future structure involving the gses  there is a possibility that new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the gses as credit enhancement or perhaps even eliminate the requirement altogether 
in connection with the homeownership affordability and stability plan  the fhfa will allow the gses to refinance their own qualifying loans without mortgage insurance if the original loan does not have mortgage insurance 
we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise 
in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility with freddie mac and fannie mae  mortgage insurers have historically been required to maintain an insurer financial strength rating of aa or aa from at least two of the three ratings agencies by which they are customarily rated 
if a mortgage insurer were to lose such eligibility  freddie mac and or fannie mae could restrict the mortgage insurer from conducting certain types of business with them  or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by the mortgage insurer 
in light of the housing market downturn  both freddie mac and fannie mae have indicated that loss of mortgage insurer eligibility due to such a downgrade will no longer be automatic and will be subject to review if and when the downgrade occurs 
we are aware of at least one private mortgage insurance company that has lost its top tier eligibility with freddie mac and fannie mae 
the eligibility requirements are subject to change from time to time  and the gses recently have proposed modifying their eligibility requirements 
we do not know whether or when such modifications may be implemented  or the form that any such modifications may take 
our mortgage insurance subsidiaries have been downgraded substantially below aa aa by s p and moody s 
in response to these ratings actions  we have presented business and financial plans to freddie mac and fannie mae for how to restore profitability and ultimately regain a higher rating for our mortgage insurance business 
see the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty depends  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio above for risks associated with this plan 
our ratings are also driven by the rating agencies views of the mortgage insurance industry as a whole 
if the capital credit we receive from the rating agencies and gses with respect to our plans is less than they believe may be required by our mortgage insurance business  we could lose our eligibility with the gses and or be further downgraded by the rating agencies 
our remediation plans include projections of our future financial performance  including the effect of significant changes to the underwriting and pricing of our business 
although their initial reactions to our plans were favorable  we cannot be certain that either of the gses will accept our plans or if we will be able to retain our eligibility status with either of them 
loss of our eligibility status with the gses would likely have an 
table of contents immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
a decrease in the volume of home mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business 
our ability to write new business depends  among other things  on a steady flow of high ltv mortgages that require our mortgage insurance 
the deterioration in the credit performance of non prime and other forms of non conforming loans has caused lenders to substantially reduce the availability of non prime mortgages and most other loan products that are not conforming loans  and to significantly tighten their underwriting standards 
fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications  while improving the overall quality of new mortgage originations  have in turn reduced the number of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult for buyers in particular first time buyers to obtain mortgage financing or to refinance their existing mortgages 
in addition  the significant disruption in the housing and related credit markets has led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mbs in the secondary market  which historically has been an available source of funding for many mortgage lenders 
this has significantly reduced liquidity in the mortgage funding marketplace  forcing many lenders to retain a larger portion of their mortgage loans and mbs and leaving them with less capacity to continue to originate new mortgages 
if the volume of new mortgage originations continues to decrease or persists at low levels for a prolonged period of time  we may experience fewer opportunities to write new insurance business  which could reduce our existing insurance in force and have a significant negative effect on both our ability to execute our business plans and our overall franchise value 
because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among a few significant customers  our new insurance written and franchise value could decline if we lose any significant customer 
our mortgage insurance business depends to a significant degree on a small number of lending customers 
as of december   our top mortgage insurance customers were generally responsible for over half of our primary new insurance written in and two mortgage insurance customers each accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues 
accordingly  maintaining our business relationships and business volumes with our largest lending customers is important to the success of our business 
challenging market conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the financial condition of a number of our largest lending customers 
these customers could become subject to serious financial constraints that may jeopardize the viability of their business plans or their access to additional capital  forcing them to consider alternatives such as bankruptcy or consolidation with others in the industry 
in addition  as a result of current market conditions  our lending customers may seek to diversify their exposure to any one or more mortgage insurers  may decide to write business only with those mortgage insurers that they perceive to have the strongest financial position  or may decide to write more business with the fha 
see our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition 
in response to the general deterioration in housing markets  we have tightened our underwriting guidelines  which has resulted in our declining to insure some of the loans originated by our larger customers 
we have also increased our pricing to reflect the increased risk of default in the current economic and housing downturn 
our increased pricing and tighter guidelines could negatively affect our relationships with our customers  potentially resulting in customers choosing to limit the amount of business they conduct with us 
the loss of business from even one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write  and consequently  our franchise value 
our master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require our mortgage insurance customers to do business with us  and we cannot be certain that any loss of business from a single lender will be recouped from other lending customers in the industry 

table of contents from time to time  we have disputes with our customers 
if not resolved  these disputes could lead to arbitration or litigation proceedings 
our recent experience with respect to increased insurance rescissions and claim denials have resulted in increased objections to certain insurance rescissions and claim denials  increasing the risk of disputes with our customers  which could potentially lead to the loss of one or more customers or to litigation with customers 
if we engage in material litigation with any customer  the customer could decide to limit the amount of business they conduct with us or terminate our business relationship altogether  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition 
the us mortgage insurance industry is highly dynamic and intensely competitive 
our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the va and the fha  which has significantly increased its competitive position in the mortgage market 
governmental and quasi governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have  and therefore  may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets decides to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political  social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
beginning in  the fha has substantially increased its market share  including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines at a lower cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance 
the fha s share of the mortgage insurance market increased significantly to for from for for information regarding certain legislative developments that have enhanced the fha s competitive position  see legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business below 
in light of the capital constraints currently facing most  if not all  private mortgage insurers and the need by private mortgage insurers to tighten underwriting guidelines based on past loan performance  we anticipate that the fha will continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position to the point that private mortgage insurers may be perceived as less significant to the future of the housing finance market 
one or more private mortgage insurers may seek to regain market share from the fha or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing as was recently publicly announced by one private mortgage insurer or loosening their underwriting guidelines  which could increase their competitive position in the industry and reduce the amount of business available to us 
it appears that the improvement in the credit quality of new loans being insured in the current market  combined with the deterioration of the financial strength ratings of most existing private mortgage insurance companies  in part due to their legacy books of insured mortgages  could encourage new entrants to our industry 
one potential new entrant  who appears to have significant capital commitments  has publicly disclosed that it has received a license to write mortgage insurance business in states and has received gse approval 
our inability to compete with other providers  including any new entrants that are not burdened by legacy credit risks  could have a material adverse effect on our business position  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  in the past  an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance developed  many of which reduced the demand for our mortgage insurance 
these alternatives included mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  mostly through loans or other forms of simultaneous second loans 
the use of simultaneous second loans increased significantly during the recent past to become a competitive alternative to private mortgage insurance  particularly in light of i the potential lower monthly cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance in a low interest rate environment and ii possible negative borrower  broker and realtor perceptions about mortgage insurance  investors using other forms of credit enhancement such as cds or securitizations as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance  and 
table of contents mortgage lenders and other intermediaries foregoing third party insurance coverage and retaining the full risk of loss on their high ltv loans 
as a result of the recent and continuing turmoil in the housing credit market  many of these alternatives to private mortgage insurance are not currently available in the mortgage market  although simultaneous second loans are still available and their use may grow again 
if market conditions were to change  however  we again could face significant competition from these alternatives as well as others that may develop 
our business depends  in part  on effective and reliable loan servicing  which may be negatively impacted by the current disruption in the housing and mortgage credit markets 
we depend on reliable  consistent third party servicing of the loans that we insure 
dependable servicing generally ensures timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near delinquent loans 
many of our customers also serve as the servicers for loans that we insure  whether the loans were originated by such customer or another lender 
therefore  the same market conditions affecting our customers as discussed above in because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among a few significant customers  our new insurance written and franchise value could decline if we lose any significant customer will also affect their ability to effectively maintain their servicing operations 
in addition  current housing trends have led to a significant increase in the number of delinquent mortgage loans requiring servicing 
these increases have strained the resources of servicers  reducing their ability to undertake loss mitigation efforts  including the processing of potential loan modifications through the us treasury department s hamp program  that could help limit our losses 
managing a substantially higher volume of under performing loans could create operational difficulties that our servicers may not have the resources to overcome 
if a disruption occurs in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies  this  in turn  could contribute to a rise in delinquencies and or claims among those loans and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
loan modification and other similar programs may not provide us with a material benefit 
the fdic  the gses and lenders have adopted programs to modify loans to make them more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures 
in february  the us treasury department announced the homeowner affordability and stability plan  which provides certain guidelines for loan modifications and allocates billion for this purpose 
some of the eligibility criteria require current information about borrowers  such as the borrowers current income and non mortgage debt payment 
because the gses and the lenders do not share such information with us  we cannot determine  with certainty  the number of loans in our delinquent inventory that are eligible to participate in such programs  therefore  our estimates of the number of qualifying loans are inherently uncertain 
while modifications made under these programs are increasing  it is unclear whether they will ultimately result in a significant number of loan modifications 
in addition  the eligibility guidelines may be changed  which may make it more difficult for some loans to be eligible for modification 
as of december   the gses changed how the net present value test is used for determining whether loan modifications may be offered under hamp 
these changes made it more difficult for some loans to be modified under hamp 
while we lack sufficient data to determine the impact of these changes  we believe that they may decrease the number of our loans that will participate in hamp 
in january  the us treasury department has further modified the hamp eligibility requirements 
for a discussion of these modifications  see business regulation federal regulation indirect regulation 
even if a loan is modified  we do not know how many modified loans will subsequently re default or whether they may eventually result in losses that would be greater than we would have suffered if the loan had 
table of contents not been modified 
in february  the obama administration announced billion of funding under the eesa to states where the average price for homes fell by more than from its peak price 
it is expected that these funds will be made available to eligible states and local housing finance agencies to assist borrowers  including unemployed borrowers  borrowers that owe more than the current value of their house  and borrowers with home equity loans or second liens 
additional guidelines for funding and other eligibility requirements are expected to be provided by the us treasury department in the near future 
we cannot ascertain with confidence whether these programs will provide material benefits to us 
the us treasury department also is supporting judicial modifications for home mortgages during bankruptcy proceedings 
if legislation is enacted to permit a mortgage balance to be reduced in bankruptcy  we would still be responsible under our master insurance policy to pay the original balance if the borrower re defaulted on that mortgage after its balance has been reduced 
various government entities and private parties have adopted foreclosure moratoriums 
a moratorium does not affect the accrual of interest and other expenses on a loan 
unless a loan is modified during a moratorium to cure the default  at the expiration of the moratorium  additional interest and expenses would be due subject to the limitation in our master policy with respect to interest  which could result in our losses on loans subject to the moratorium being higher than if there had been no moratorium 
there is no guarantee that these loan modification programs will be fully implemented or  if in effect  that they will continue to be available 
any termination or temporary cessation of any of these programs could result in an increased number of claims in our mortgage insurance business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
mortgage refinancings in the current housing market may increase the risk profile of our existing mortgage insurance portfolio 
mortgage interest rates currently are at historically low levels that have led many borrowers to seek to refinance their existing mortgages 
however  because most lenders are currently utilizing more restrictive underwriting guidelines  only those borrowers with strong credit profiles are generally able to qualify for the new loans required to refinance 
consequently  only highly qualified borrowers are generally able to refinance in the current market 
as more of these borrowers refinance and their existing mortgage insurance with us is canceled  the total percentage of our risk in force related to high risk borrowers could possibly increase  which could increase the risk profile of our existing mortgage insurance portfolio and potentially reduce the future profitability of our mortgage insurance business 
our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks  the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses 
our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty premium rates may not be adequate to cover future losses 
our mortgage insurance premiums are based on our long term expected risk of claims on insured loans  and take into account  among other factors  each loan s ltv  type eg  prime vs 
non prime or fixed vs 
variable payments  term  coverage percentage or the existence of a deductible in front of our loss position 
our financial guaranty premiums are based on our expected risk of claim on the insured obligation  and take into account  among other factors  the rating and creditworthiness of the issuer and of the insured obligations  the type of insured obligation  the policy term and the structure of the transaction being insured 
in addition  our premium rates take into account expected cancellation rates  operating expenses and reinsurance costs  as well as profit and capital needs and the prices that we expect our competitors to offer 
our estimates and expectations are based on assumptions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
in particular  the predictive value of historical data may be less reliable during periods of greater economic stress and  accordingly  our ability to correctly estimate our premium requirements may be impaired during the current economic uncertainty 
we generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance or financial guaranty insurance coverage we provide  and because we generally fix premium rates for the life of a policy when issued  we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums over the life of a policy 
therefore  even if the risk 
table of contents underlying many of the mortgage or financial guaranty products we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated  including as a result of the on going economic recession and housing market downturn  which has led to a significant increase in defaults and claims  and the premiums our customers are currently paying for similar coverage on new business from us and others has increased  we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in force business  or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage  to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments 
our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur 
an increase in the amount or frequency of claims beyond the levels contemplated by our pricing assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims 
in our mortgage insurance business  we enter into agreements with our mortgage lender customers that commit us to insure loans using pre established underwriting guidelines 
once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program  we generally insure a loan originated by that lender even if the lender does not follow our specified underwriting guidelines 
under this program  a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender s delegated underwriting authority as well as pursuing other rights that may be available to us  such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims 
the performance of loans insured through programs of delegated underwriting has not been tested over a period of extended adverse economic conditions  and the program could lead to greater losses than we anticipate in light of the current economic downturn 
greater than anticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we face risks associated with our contract underwriting business 
we provide contract underwriting services for certain of our mortgage lender customers  including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree that if we make material errors that lead to a default in connection with these services  the mortgage lender may  subject to certain conditions  require us to purchase the loans  issue mortgage insurance on the loans  or indemnify the lender against future loss associated with the loans 
accordingly  we assume some credit risk and interest rate risk in connection with providing these services 
in  we underwrote billion in principal amount of loans for customers through contract underwriting 
depending on market conditions  a significant amount of our underwriting services may be performed by independent contractors hired by us on a temporary basis 
if these independent contractors make more material errors than we anticipate  the resulting need to provide greater than anticipated recourse to mortgage lenders could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings or the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to any of our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty subsidiaries is possible and could weaken our competitive position and affect our financial condition 
the credit ratings of radian group and the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries were downgraded multiple times since and may be subject to further downgrade 
in december  s p downgraded the financial strength ratings of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries to bb and also downgraded radian group s other subsidiaries  including radian guaranty and amerin guaranty to b 
at our request  s p also withdrew the financial strength ratings of raal 
on february   moody s affirmed the ratings of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative 
in response to current market conditions  the rating agencies are engaged in ongoing monitoring of the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty industries and could take action  including by downgrading or warning of the strong possibility of downgrade  with respect to one or more companies in a specific industry 
although we remain in frequent contact with the rating agencies and have prepared action plans to address rating agency actions  we are generally not provided with much advance notice of an impending rating decision  which could come at any time 

table of contents historically  our ratings have been critical to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products 
a downgrade in these ratings or the announcement of the potential of a downgrade  or any other concern relating to the on going financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries  could make it difficult or impossible for them to continue to write new profitable business or create a competitive advantage for other industry participants that maintain higher ratings than us 
further  although we believe the gses currently are not as concerned with ratings as they have been in past periods  any additional downgrade of the insurance financial strength ratings for our mortgage insurance business could negatively impact our eligibility status with the gses 
see we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise 
a downgrade may make it more difficult for us to successfully raise capital  including by imposing terms not acceptable to us or by limiting us to raising an amount that would not be sufficient to restore or stabilize our ratings 
because we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until a borrower has failed to make two payments rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on non defaulted loans  our financial statements may not reflect our expected obligation for losses on our entire portfolio of insured mortgages 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we generally do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two consecutive payments when due 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and the type of loan product to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status 
because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to non defaulted loans  our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements  except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists 
as a result  future losses may have a material impact on future results as delinquencies occur 
if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty businesses are incorrect  we may be required to take unexpected charges to income which could hurt our capital position 
we establish loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses to provide for the estimated cost of future claims 
because our reserves represent our best estimate of claims  these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay 
setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of anticipated losses 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may prove to be inaccurate  especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme credit market volatility  as currently exists 
if our estimates are inadequate  we may be required to increase our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  capital position and operating results  as well as our ability to continue to write new business 
in addition to establishing mortgage insurance loss reserves in accordance with the immediately preceding risk factor  we are required under gaap to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount by which the net present value of expected future losses for a particular product and the expenses for such product exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums and existing reserves for such product 
we evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists at the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   a premium deficiency reserve of million existed for our second lien mortgage insurance business 
because our evaluation of premium deficiency is based on our best estimate of future losses  expenses and premiums  the evaluation is inherently uncertain and may prove to be inaccurate 
although no premium deficiency existed on our first lien mortgage insurance business at december   there can be no assurance that additional premium deficiency reserves will not be required for this product or our other mortgage insurance products in future periods 

table of contents it also is difficult to estimate appropriate loss reserves for our financial guaranty business because of the nature of potential losses in that business  which are largely influenced by the particular circumstances surrounding each troubled credit  including the availability of loss mitigation  and therefore  are less capable of being evaluated based on historical assumptions or precedent 
in addition  in our financial guaranty reinsurance business  we rely in part on information provided by the ceding company in order to establish reserves 
if this information is incomplete or untimely  our loss reserves may be inaccurate and could require material adjustment in future periods as new or corrected information becomes available 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio 
income from our investment portfolio is one of our primary sources of cash flow to support our operations and claim payments 
if we underestimate our policy liabilities  or if we improperly structure our investments to meet those liabilities  we could have unexpected losses  including losses resulting from forced liquidation of investments before their maturity 
our investments and investment policies and those of our subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws 
we may be forced to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory  economic and market conditions and the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements  including the tax position  of our business segments 
our investment objectives may not be achieved 
although our portfolio consists mostly of highly rated investments and complies with applicable regulatory requirements  the success of our investment activity is affected by general economic conditions  which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest rate sensitive securities  including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets  the level and volatility of interest rates and  consequently  the value of our fixed income securities 
volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we directly or indirectly hold positions has reduced the market value of some of our investments and has caused certain other than temporary impairments within our portfolio  which  if this worsens substantially  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and operating results 
as a holding company  radian group relies on its operating subsidiaries to fund its dividend payments and to meet its obligations and has intercompany payment obligations under its tax sharing agreement 
radian group acts principally as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own 
radian group s most significant liquidity demands for the foreseeable future include funds for i the payment of certain corporate expenses which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  ii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iii repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt  including the principal amount of our debentures due in june  of which million is outstanding as of february   as well as million in principal amount of senior notes due in each of and  iv payments to our insurance subsidiaries under our tax sharing agreement  including our current estimate of million to be paid to radian guaranty in october  of which million has been paid in february  which amount may increase or decrease if actual tax losses in are worse or better than projected and a maximum of million  which may be required to be paid to radian guaranty in october  v potential capital support for our insurance subsidiaries  and vi the payment of dividends on our common stock 
radian group had immediately available directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and marketable securities of approximately million at december  dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are radian group s principal sources of cash 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in light of on going losses in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  we do not anticipate that these subsidiaries will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the 
table of contents extent radian asset assurance and sherman issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to radian guaranty  their direct parent company  and not to radian group 
the expense sharing arrangements between radian group and our insurance subsidiaries  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be changed at any time 
if the cash radian group receives from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payments and expense and tax sharing arrangements and other sources of liquidity is insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  we may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the need to raise additional capital or the failure to make timely payments on our obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  radian group may be required to make additional payments to its subsidiaries under its tax sharing agreement as follows in november  new tax legislation was enacted that permits a company to extend the existing carryback period from two years to up to five years for net operating losses nols incurred in or taxpayers are only entitled to extend the carryback period for either the or tax year  but not both years 
while an analysis of the overall impact has not been completed  we do not believe that this legislation will have a material impact on radian group s consolidated federal income tax  however  if we make an election to extend our carryback provision  radian group may be required to make payments to its subsidiaries under the tax sharing agreement 
certain of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  other than radian guaranty  may not be able to utilize estimated nols since they may not generate sufficient taxable income on a separate company basis 
if those subsidiaries were to generate taxable income  then radian group may be required to make payments to them to the extent such nol had been utilized on a consolidated basis 
each of these subsidiaries has incurred significant losses in the recent past and we do not expect them to generate any significant taxable income  if any  in the future 
for additional information regarding our liquidity demands and sources of liquidity  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our credit derivatives that require us to adjust their fair market value as reflected on our income statement 
we provide credit enhancement in the form of derivative contracts 
the gains and losses on these derivative contracts are derived from internally generated models  which may differ from models used by our counterparties or others in the industry 
we estimate fair value amounts using market information  to the extent available  and valuation methodologies that we deem appropriate in order to estimate the fair value amounts that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability 
considerable judgment is required to interpret available market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
since there currently is no active market for many derivative products  we have had to use assumptions as to what could be realized in a current market exchange 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold or transferred in a forced liquidation  the fair values received or paid could be materially different than those reflected in our financial statements 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies derivative instruments and vie liabilities of this annual report on form k 
temporary market or credit spread changes as well as actual credit improvement or deterioration in our derivative contracts are reflected in changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
because the adjustments referenced above are reflected on our statements of operations  they affect our reported earnings and create earnings volatility 
additionally  beginning in  in accordance with the accounting pronouncement regarding fair value measurements  we made an adjustment to our derivatives valuation methodology to account for our 
table of contents own non performance risk by incorporating our observable cds spread into the determination of fair value of our credit derivatives 
our five year cds spread has increased significantly since january  and was  basis points as of december  this market perception of our high risk of non performance has had the effect of reducing our derivative liability valuations by approximately billion as of december  if our cds spread were to tighten significantly  and other credit spreads utilized in our fair value methodologies remained constant  our earnings could be significantly reduced 
the performance of our strategic investments could harm our financial results 
part of our business involves strategic investments in other companies  and we generally do not have control over the way that these companies run their day to day operations 
our equity interest in sherman  through radian guaranty  currently represents our most significant strategic investment 
sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets  which are generally unsecured  that sherman typically purchases at deep discounts from national financial institutions and major retail corporations and upon which it subsequently seeks to collect 
in addition  sherman originates subprime credit card receivables through its subsidiary creditone and has certain other similar ventures related to consumer assets 
consequently  sherman s results could be adversely impacted by sherman s ability to obtain or renew financing  a portion of which is renewable annually  and its ability to accomplish this on reasonable terms  mispricing of the pools of consumer assets it purchases or the availability of pools for purchase on acceptable terms  macroeconomic or other factors that could diminish the success of its collection efforts on the variety of consumer assets it owns  including new legislation and regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation  such as the credit card accountability  responsibility and disclosure act of  that can impact sherman s ability to collect and the amount of fees it can charge  and the results of its credit card origination business  which are sensitive to interest rate changes  charge off losses and the success of its collection efforts  and which may be impacted by macroeconomic factors that affect a borrower s ability to pay 
as a result of their significant collection efforts  there is a risk that sherman could be subject to consumer related lawsuits and other investigations related to fair debt collection practices  which could have an adverse effect on sherman s income  reputation and future ability to conduct business 
in addition  sherman is particularly exposed to consumer credit risk as a result of its credit card origination business and unsecured lending business through creditone 
national credit card lenders have reported decreased spending by card members and an increase in delinquencies and loan write offs as a result of the on going turmoil in the consumer credit markets 
a continuation of current economic trends could materially impact the future results of sherman  which  in turn  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our international operations subject us to risks 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our legacy international mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business activities  including dependence on regulatory and third party approvals  foreign governments monetary policies and regulatory requirements  economic downturns in targeted foreign mortgage origination markets  interest rate volatility in a variety of countries  political risk and risks of war  terrorism  civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  
table of contents the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign regulations and laws  some of which are materially different than the regulatory and statutory requirements we face in our domestic business  and which may change unexpectedly  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
given our current strategic focus on us mortgage insurance  we have ceased writing new international business and have significantly reduced our existing international exposures 
in certain cases  our ability to reduce our exposure depends on our counterparty s ability to find alternative insurance  which opportunities are limited in the current global economic downturn 
accordingly  we may not be able to recover the capital we invested in our international operations for many years and may not recover all of such capital if losses are worse than expected 
further  any one or more of the risks listed above could limit or prohibit us from effectively running off our international operations 
we currently hold a interest in the holding company of a brazilian insurance company  which specializes in surety and agricultural insurance 
this company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the superintendence of private insurance  the regulatory agency responsible for the supervision and control of the insurance market in brazil 
although we wrote off our entire interest in this company in  under brazilian law  as a significant shareholder  it is possible that we could become liable for our proportionate share of the liabilities of the company our share represents approximately million as of december   if the company was to become insolvent and had insufficient capital to satisfy its outstanding liabilities 
the company is currently in compliance with brazilian minimum capital requirements although its ability to write new business may be limited 
we may lose business if we are unable to meet our customers technological demands 
participants in the mortgage insurance industry rely on e commerce and other technologies to provide and expand their products and services 
our customers generally require that we provide aspects of our products and services electronically  and the percentage of our new insurance written and claims processing that we deliver electronically has continued to increase 
we expect this trend to continue and  accordingly  we may be unable to satisfy our customers requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or otherwise are unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities 
this may result in a decrease in the business we receive  which could impact our profitability 
our information technology systems may not be configured to process information regarding new and emerging products 
many of our information technology systems  which have been in place for a number of years  originally were designed to process information regarding traditional products 
as new products with new features emerge or when we modify our underwriting standards as we have done recently  our systems may require modification in order to recognize these features to allow us to price or bill for our insurance of these products appropriately 
our systems also may not be capable of recording  or may incorrectly record  information about these products that may be important to our risk management and other functions 
in addition  our customers may encounter similar technological issues that prevent them from sending us complete information about the products or transactions that we insure 
making appropriate modifications to our systems involves inherent time lags and may require us to incur significant expenses 
the inability to make necessary modifications to our systems in a timely and cost effective manner may have adverse effects on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we could be adversely affected if personal information that we maintain on consumers is improperly disclosed 
as part of our business  we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates maintain large amounts of personal information on consumers 
while we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems to prevent unauthorized disclosure  there can be no assurance that unauthorized disclosure  either through the actions of third parties or our employees  will not occur 
unauthorized disclosure could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to material claims for damages 
we are subject to the risk of private litigation and regulatory proceedings 
we face litigation risk in the ordinary course of operations  including the risk of class action lawsuits such as those that we are currently facing  including i the stockholder class action lawsuits filed in august and september cortese v 
radian group inc and maslar v 
radian group inc  which were consolidated into in re radian securities litigation against radian group and individual defendants in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that we were aware of and failed to disclose the actual financial condition of c bass prior to our declaration of a material impairment to our investment in c bass  and ii a purported class action lawsuit filed in april against radian group  the compensation and human resources committee of our board of directors and individual defendants in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  alleging violations of the employee retirement income securities act as it relates to our savings incentive plan 
for additional information regarding these class action lawsuits  see part i  item  legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
we cannot predict whether other actions may be brought against us in the future 
any such proceedings could have an adverse affect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on october   we received a letter from the staff of the chicago regional office of the sec stating that the staff is conducting an investigation involving radian group and requesting production of certain documents 
the staff has also requested that certain of our current and former employees and directors provide voluntary testimony in this matter 
we believe that the investigation generally relates to the previously proposed merger with mgic and radian group s investment in c bass 
we are cooperating with the requests of the sec 
the sec staff has informed us that this investigation should not be construed as an indication by the commission or its staff that any violation of the securities laws has occurred  or as a reflection upon any person  entity or security 
from time to time we have disputes with our customers 
if not resolved  these disputes could lead to arbitration or litigation proceedings 
our recent experience with respect to increased insurance rescissions and claim denials has heightened the risk of disputes with our customers  which could potentially lead to the loss of one or more customers or to litigation 
in addition  there has been increased litigation in our industry relating to rescissions and claim denials 
although we are not a party to any such litigation  we cannot predict whether such actions may be brought against us 
if we engage in material litigation with any customer  the customer could decide to limit the amount of business they conduct with us or terminate our business relationship altogether  which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
our senior management and board of directors have been required to devote significant time to these and related matters and will likely be required to devote substantial additional time to these matters in the future 
there can be no assurance that these lawsuits  regulatory investigations and other legal matters will not have a disruptive effect upon the operations of the business 
in addition  we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur  substantial expenses in connection with such matters  including substantial fees for attorneys and other professional advisors 
we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate a range of damages in the event plaintiffs in these or other additional litigation prevail under one or more of their claims 
in addition  we are cooperating with the sec regarding the above investigation but we cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation or other regulatory proceedings 
depending on the outcome of any such investigation or other regulatory proceeding  we may be required to pay material fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct or 
table of contents suffer other penalties  remedies or sanctions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results  financial condition  and liquidity  and on the trading price of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional lawsuits  regulatory and other matters will not arise 
see also legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business  legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our financial guaranty business and the internal revenue service irs is examining our tax returns for the years through the internal revenue service irs is examining our tax returns for the years through we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for the through tax years 
the irs opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics and has proposed adjustments denying the associated tax benefits of these items 
in may  the irs proposed adjustments relating to the through tax years  which would increase our tax liability by approximately million for this period 
we have appealed these proposed adjustments with the irs office of appeals and have made a qualified deposit with the us department of the treasury of approximately million to avoid the accrual of the associated above market rate interest 
in february  the irs proposed adjustments relating to the through tax years  which would increase our tax liability by approximately million 
we plan to appeal such proposed adjustments and we may make a qualified deposit as described above 
although we disagree with and are contesting with respect to the through tax years  and plan to contest with respect to the through tax years  the adjustments proposed by the irs  and believe that our income and loss from these investments were properly reported on our federal income tax returns in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the applicable periods  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in opposing the additional tax liability  interest or penalties with respect to this investment 
the overall appeals process may take some time  and a final resolution may not be reached until a date many months or years into the future 
additionally  although we believe  after discussions with outside counsel about the issues raised in the examination and the procedures for resolution of the disputed adjustments  that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for potential liabilities that may result  if the outcome of this matter results in liability that differs materially from our expectations  it could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and cash flows 
we have concluded that a valuation allowance is required with regard to our million net deferred tax asset dta and an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset dta in the amount of million 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance against our dta when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our dta will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess our need for a valuation allowance and this assessment is based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such dta will be realized in future periods 
future realization of our dta will ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character ordinary income or capital gains within the applicable carryforward period provided under the tax law 
among the more significant positive evidence that we considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance needed is our tax planning strategy  which was partially implemented during  of converting the investment portfolio from tax exempt securities to securities that provide fully taxable interest 
a valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded against our million dta related to certain state nols 
these state nols were generated by our operating subsidiaries and  due to limitations imposed upon the utilization of such nols by the various tax jurisdictions  we cannot be certain that these nols will be fully utilized during the applicable carryforward periods 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect  an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
recognition of an additional valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 

table of contents our ability to recognize tax benefits on future domestic us tax losses and our existing us net operating loss position may be limited 
we have generated substantial nols  loss carryforwards and other tax attributes for us tax purposes that can be used to reduce our future federal income tax obligations 
our ability to fully use these tax assets including nols of  million as of december  will be adversely affected if we have an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code irc of  as amended 
an ownership change is generally defined as a greater than percentage point increase in equity ownership by five percent shareholders as that term is defined for purposes of section of the irc in any three year period 
we may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership 
on october   our board of directors adopted a tax benefit preservation plan  and as amended on february  the plan in order to protect our ability to utilize our nols and other tax assets from an ownership change under us federal income tax rules 
however  there is no guarantee that the plan will be effective in protecting our nols and other tax assets 
determining whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty  both because of the complexity and ambiguity of section of the irc and because of limitations on a publicly traded company s knowledge as to the ownership of  and transactions in  its securities 
therefore  we cannot assure you that the irs or other taxing authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change before we adopted the plan and attempt to reduce the benefit of our tax assets 
furthermore  while the plan is intended to deter acquisitions that may adversely affect our tax position  such acquisitions may still occur 
in addition  the plan may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us  and may discourage open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock 
accordingly  the plan may limit a stockholder s ability to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock in connection with any stock transaction 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business 
our business and legal liabilities are affected by the application of federal or state consumer lending and insurance laws and regulations  or by unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations 
for example  hera includes reforms to the fha  and provides the fha with greater flexibility in establishing new products and increases the fha s competitive position against private mortgage insurers 
this law increased the maximum loan amount that the fha can insure and established a higher minimum cash down payment 
hera also contained provisions  called the hope for homeownership program  by which the fha is authorized to refinance distressed mortgages in return for lenders and investors agreeing to write down the amount of the original mortgage 
the eesa and the us treasury department s homeowner affordability and stability plan include provisions that encourage further use of the hope for homeowners program and further strengthen support for fha programs by easing restrictions in these programs 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of these changes upon demand for our products 
however  beginning in  the fha has materially increased its market share  in part by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines  as a result of these recent legislative and regulatory changes 
see our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition above 
any further increase in the competition we face from the fha or any other government sponsored entities could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under the anti referral fee provisions of respa and that we have failed to comply with the notice provisions of the fair credit reporting act fcra 
in addition  class action lawsuits have been brought against a number of large lenders alleging that their captive reinsurance arrangements violated respa 
while we are not currently a defendant in any case 
table of contents related to respa or fcra  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to any future litigation under respa or fcra or that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse affect on us 
we and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries from the nyid and the minnesota department of commerce relating to our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements  and we have also received a subpoena from the office of the inspector general of hud  requesting information relating to captive reinsurance 
we cannot predict whether these inquiries will lead to further inquiries  or further investigations of these arrangements  or the scope  timing or outcome of the present inquiries or any other inquiry or action by these or other regulators 
although we believe that all of our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements comply with applicable legal requirements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend against any alleged violations of respa or other laws 
proposed changes to the application of respa could harm our competitive position 
hud proposed an exemption under respa for lenders that  at the time a borrower submits a loan application  give the borrower a firm  guaranteed price for all the settlement services associated with the loan  commonly referred to as bundling 
in  hud indicated its intention to abandon the proposed rule and to submit a revised proposed rule to the us congress 
hud began looking at the reform process again in and a new rule was proposed in we do not know what form  if any  this rule will take or whether it will be promulgated 
in addition  hud has also declared its intention to seek legislative changes to respa 
we cannot predict which changes will be implemented and whether the premiums we are able to charge for mortgage insurance will be negatively affected 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our financial guaranty business 
the laws and regulations affecting the municipal  asset backed and trade credit debt markets  as well as other governmental regulations  may be changed in ways that could adversely affect our financial guaranty business 
our regulators are reviewing the laws  rules and regulations applicable to financial guarantors in light of the current market disruptions 
these reviews could result in additional limitations on our ability to conduct our financial guaranty business  including additional restrictions and limitations on our ability to declare dividends or more stringent statutory capital requirements for all or certain segments of our financial guaranty businesses 
any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the implementation of the basel ii capital accord may discourage the use of mortgage insurance 
in  the basel committee on banking supervision developed the basel capital accord the basel i  which set out international benchmarks for assessing banks capital adequacy requirements 
in june  the basel committee issued an update to basel i as revised in november  basel ii 
basel ii was implemented by many banks in the us and many other countries in and may be implemented by the remaining banks in the us and many other countries in basel ii affects the capital treatment provided to mortgage insurance by domestic and international banks in both their origination and securitization activities 
the basel ii provisions related to residential mortgages and mortgage insurance may provide incentives to certain of our bank customers not to insure mortgages having a lower risk of claim and to insure mortgages having a higher risk of claim

table of contents complaint without prejudice 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on august  as was the case with the initial complaint  we do not believe that the allegations in the amended complaint have any merit  and we intend to defend against this action vigorously 
on june   we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  naming indymac  deutsche bank national trust company deutsche bank  fgic  ambac and mbia insurance corporation mbia as defendants 
the suit involves three of our pool policies covering second lien mortgages  entered into in late and early with respect to loans originated by indymac 
we are in a second loss position behind indymac and in front of three defendant financial guaranty companies 
we alleged that the representations and warranties made to us to induce us to issue the policies were materially false  and that as a result  the policies should be void 
the total amount of our claim liability for all three pool policies was approximately million  without giving effect to our settlements with ambac and mbia of an aggregate of million of the approximately million in total claim liability  as described below 
after being stayed for several months as a result of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic s seizure of indymac  this action resumed in april  at which time the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action 
also in june  indymac filed a suit against us in california state court in los angeles on the same policies  alleging that we have wrongfully denied claims or rescinded coverage on the underlying loans 
this action was subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
in march  fgic  ambac  and mbia served us with demands to arbitrate certain issues relating to the same three pool policies that are the subject of our declaratory judgment complaint 
in july  the court declined to dismiss our declaratory judgment action  but stayed the action to permit the arbitrations to proceed first

the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item and the risk factors detailed in item a of part i of this report 
business summary overview we are a credit enhancement company with a primary strategic focus on domestic  first lien residential mortgage insurance 
our business segments are mortgage insurance  financial guaranty and financial services 
mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance segment provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions 
we have provided these products and services mainly through our wholly owned subsidiaries  radian guaranty inc  amerin guaranty corporation  and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  amerin guaranty  and radian insurance  respectively 
private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default related losses on residential mortgage loans made mostly to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  most of which are sold to freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we refer to freddie mac and fannie mae together as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance segment  through radian guaranty  offers primary and pool mortgage insurance coverage on residential  first lien mortgages first lien 
at december   primary insurance on first liens made up approximately of our total first lien insurance risk in force  and pool insurance on first liens made up approximately of our total first lien mortgage insurance risk in force 
our primary business focus is traditional primary mortgage insurance on first liens 
non traditional mortgage credit enhancement 
in addition to traditional mortgage insurance  in the past we have used radian insurance or amerin guaranty to provide other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets 
these products include mortgage insurance on second lien mortgages second lien  credit enhancement on net interest margin securities nims  credit default swaps cds on domestic and international mortgages and primary mortgage insurance on international mortgages collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as non traditional or other risk 
these non traditional or other risk products were once a growing part of our total mortgage insurance business 
however  in light of the deterioration in housing and related credit markets  we stopped writing all non traditional business in  other than a small amount of international mortgage insurance  which we also discontinued writing in reduction of legacy risk 
during  in order to maximize our capital base for pursuing new mortgage insurance business  we continued to pursue opportunities to reduce our legacy mortgage insurance portfolio  including a significant reduction in all non core mortgage insurance risk in force 
we executed upon this strategy through a series of commutations  transaction settlements or terminations  including the following notable transactions we terminated million of risk in force  comprising million of modified pool risk in force and million of pool risk in force the december mi termination 
in connection with this termination  we paid million to our counterparty  while the existing aggregate loss reserves were million  resulting in approximately million of pre tax income 
because we include modified pool in our primary insurance in force  this transaction had the effect of reducing our primary insurance in force by billion  and reduced our primary delinquency count by  
table of contents we terminated certain captive reinsurance agreements  resulting in payments to us of million from the captive trust accounts in excess of our ceded loss recoverable for these transactions 
these amounts are accounted for as claims recoveries 
in  we terminated million of second lien risk in force for a payment of million 
in addition  in january  we settled with a counterparty on approximately million of second lien risk in force for a settlement price of million 
we paid million to terminate all of our five remaining domestic mortgage insurance cds transactions with a notional amount of million 
the settlement payments were approximately equal to the fair value of these terminated transactions 
we paid million to terminate one large international cds representing approximately billion of notional value 
we purchased approximately million of nims bonds at a purchase price of million  which approximated the fair value liability for these transactions at december  financial guaranty our financial guaranty business has mainly provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit based risks through radian asset assurance inc radian asset assurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of radian guaranty  and through radian asset assurance s wholly owned subsidiary radian asset assurance limited raal  an insurance company licensed in the united kingdom 
financial guaranty insurance typically provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued at the inception of an insured obligation or may be issued for the benefit of a holder of an obligation in the secondary market 
historically  financial guaranty insurance has been used to lower an issuer s cost of borrowing when the insurance premium is less than the value of the spread commonly referred to as the credit spread between the market yield required to be paid on the insured obligation carrying the credit rating of the insurer and the market yield required to be paid on the obligation if sold on the basis of its uninsured credit rating 
financial guaranty insurance also has been used to increase the marketability of obligations issued by infrequent or unknown issuers or obligations with complex structures 
historically  investors have benefited from financial guaranty insurance through increased liquidity in the secondary market  reduced exposure to price volatility caused by changes in the credit quality of the underlying insured issue  and added protection against loss in the event of the obligor s default on its obligation 
market developments  including ratings downgrades of most financial guaranty insurance companies including radian asset assurance and raal  have significantly reduced the benefits of financial guaranty insurance 
we have provided direct financial guaranty credit protection either through the issuance of a financial guaranty insurance policy or through cds 
either form of credit enhancement can provide the purchaser of such credit protection with a guaranty of the timely payment of interest and scheduled principal when due on a covered financial obligation 
by providing protection through cds  we have been able to participate in transactions involving asset classes such as corporate collateralized debt obligations cdos that may not have been available to us through the issuance of a traditional financial guaranty insurance policy 
either form of credit enhancement requires similar underwriting and surveillance skills 
we have historically offered the following financial guaranty products public finance insurance of public finance obligations  including tax exempt and taxable indebtedness of states  counties  cities  special service districts  other political subdivisions  enterprises such as public and private higher education institutions and health care facilities  and for project finance and private finance initiative assets in sectors such as airports  education  healthcare and other infrastructure projects  
table of contents structured finance insurance of structured finance obligations  including cdos and asset backed securities abs  consisting of funded and non funded referred to herein as synthetic executions that are payable from or tied to the performance of a specific pool of assets or covered reference entities 
examples of the pools of assets that underlie structured finance obligations include corporate loans  bonds or other borrowed money  residential and commercial mortgages  trust preferred securities trups  diversified payment rights dpr  a variety of consumer loans  equipment receivables  real and personal property leases or a combination of asset classes or securities backed by one or more of these pools of assets 
we have also guaranteed excess clearing losses of securities exchange clearinghouses  and reinsurance reinsurance of domestic and international public finance obligations  including those issued by sovereign and sub sovereign entities  and structured finance obligations 
in the third quarter of  in light of market conditions  we decided to discontinue  for the foreseeable future  writing any new financial guaranty business  including accepting new financial guaranty reinsurance  other than as may be necessary to commute  restructure  hedge or otherwise mitigate losses or reduce exposure in our existing portfolio 
commensurate with this decision  we have reduced our financial guaranty operations  including reductions in our workforce  and have begun to wind down the business of raal 
we have also reduced our financial guaranty exposures through commutations in order to eliminate risk and maximize capital for our mortgage insurance business 
on july   radian asset assurance entered into a commutation and release agreement with ambac assurance corporation and ambac assurance uk limited collectively  ambac 
under this agreement  on july   radian asset assurance paid a million settlement payment to ambac to commute billion of radian asset assurance net par outstanding assumed from ambac the ambac commutation 
the risk commuted under this agreement represented of radian asset assurance s reinsured portfolio with ambac  of radian asset assurance s total reinsurance portfolio and of radian asset assurance s total insured portfolio  in each case as of june  the ambac commutation also reduced radian asset assurance s financial guaranty exposure to mortgage backed securities mbs by as of june  financial guaranty exposure subject to recapture or termination 
as a result of the downgrades of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries beginning in june  approximately billion of our total net par outstanding as of december  representing of our total net par outstanding  remains subject to recapture or termination at the option of our reinsurance customers  our credit derivative counterparties or other insured parties 

table of contents all of our unaffiliated reinsurance customers have the right to recapture business previously ceded to us due to the downgrades of our financial guaranty financial strength ratings 
as of december   billion of our net assumed par outstanding included in total net par outstanding was subject to recapture 
if all of this business was recaptured as of december   the impact on our financial statements would have been as follows statement of operations in millions decrease in assumed premiums written decrease in net premiums earned increase in change in fair value of derivative instruments decrease in policy acquisition costs decrease in provision for losses increase in pre tax income balance sheet in millions decrease in cash deferred policy acquisition costs accounts and notes receivable derivative assets unearned premiums reserve for losses and lae derivative liabilities assuming all of this business was recaptured as of december   radian asset assurance s statutory surplus would have increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the release of contingency reserves 
the net present value of installment premiums on derivative contracts would have decreased by million 
as of december   as a result of the downgrades of our financial guaranty financial strength ratings  the counterparties to of our financial guaranty transactions currently have the right to terminate these transactions 
if all of these counterparties had terminated these transactions as of december   our net par outstanding would have been reduced by billion  with a corresponding decrease in unearned premium reserves of million and a decrease in the present value of expected future installment premiums of million 
net unrealized losses on derivatives of million would also have been reversed had these transactions been terminated 
we have no transaction where our counterparty currently has the right to terminate the transaction with settlement on a mark to market basis 
financial services our financial services segment mainly consists of our equity interest in sherman financial group llc sherman  a consumer asset and servicing firm 
our financial services segment also includes our interest in credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass  a mortgage investment company which we wrote off completely in and whose operations are currently in run off 
sherman 
sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets  which are generally unsecured  that sherman typically purchases at deep discounts from national financial institutions and major retail corporations and upon which it subsequently seeks to collect 
in addition  sherman originates subprime credit card receivables through its subsidiary creditone and has certain other similar ventures related to consumer assets 
sherman used much of its operating cash flow to reduce its total outstanding debt balance in radian guaranty received a million dividend from sherman in january 
table of contents c bass 
historically  c bass was engaged as a mortgage investment and servicing company specializing in the credit risk of subprime single family residential mortgages 
as a result of the disruption in the subprime mortgage market during  c bass ceased purchasing mortgages and mortgage securities and its securitization activities in the third quarter of and sold its loan servicing platform in the fourth quarter of the run off of c bass s business is dictated by an override agreement to which we and all of c bass s other owners and creditors are parties 
this agreement provides the basis for the collection and distribution of cash generated from c bass s whole loans and securities portfolio  as well as the sale of certain assets  including the loan servicing platform 
we recorded a full write off of our equity interest in c bass in the third quarter of and wrote off our million credit facility with c bass in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a consequence of the complete write off of our investment in c bass in  we have no continuing interest of value in c bass 
the effect of c bass on our financial position and results of operations as of and for the years ended december  and  was negligible 
we have no contractual obligations to c bass or its creditors to fund c bass s shareholders deficit or any other of its obligations 
all of c bass s business is currently in run off and we anticipate that all future cash flows of c bass will be used to service the outstanding debt 
the likelihood that we will recover any of our investment is extremely remote 
accordingly  we believe that the chance that our investments in c bass will have anything more than a negligible impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows at any time in the future is extremely remote 
ratings our holding company  radian group  currently is rated ccc stable by standard and poor s rating service s p and caa negative outlook by moody s investors service moody s 
our principal operating subsidiaries have been assigned the following financial strength ratings moody s s p radian guaranty ba b radian insurance b b amerin guaranty ba b radian asset assurance ba bb raal ba moody s ratings outlook for all our insurance subsidiaries is currently negative 
s p s ratings outlook for all our subsidiaries is currently negative 
we have requested that these ratings be withdrawn 
ratings have been withdrawn 
recent ratings actions s p on november   s p lowered the ratings on our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries to bb from bbb and left the ratings on creditwatch with negative implications 
the actions were a result of adverse loss development in our financial guaranty insured portfolio  including in particular trups cdos and their view of the risks related to cdos of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and corporate cdos 
in addition  s p views radian asset assurance s rating as highly correlated to the rating of radian guaranty  because of the risk of radian guaranty requiring radian asset assurance to provide it with additional capital 
as a result  s p currently restricts radian asset assurance s rating to no higher than one notch above radian guaranty s rating 
on december   s p lowered the ratings on several private mortgage insurance companies  including our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  after placing such ratings on creditwatch with negative implications on october  s p downgraded our mortgage insurance subsidiaries ratings from bb to b and removed these ratings from creditwatch 
the actions were the result of s p s view that macroeconomic conditions appear to have had a more significant adverse impact on mortgage insurers than they had expected 
table of contents when they last conducted an extensive review of the sector in april s p indicated that losses for mortgage insurers have exceeded their prior loss expectations 
s p also assigned a negative outlook for these mortgage insurers  including our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  largely reflecting their belief in the potential for increased losses because of the macroeconomic environment 
s p also lowered the ratings on our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries from bb to bb to reflect the ratings change of radian guaranty 
the ratings of raal were withdrawn subsequent to these ratings actions at our request 
recent ratings actions moody s on february   moody s affirmed the insurance financial strength ratings  with negative outlook  of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries because moody s believes that our mortgage insurance capital position has not materially changed over the past year  with the deterioration in the delinquency rate offset by run off and terminations of second lien and pool portfolios as well as our purchase of nims bonds at a discount to par 
according to moody s  the negative outlook reflects the risk of losses being in excess of current estimates  including possible stress at radian asset assurance  the uncertain industry dynamics and the challenging economic environment 
although moody s has indicated that radian guaranty is relatively well positioned to take advantage of the current market conditions given its stronger relative capital profile  it noted the uncertainty surrounding the private mortgage industry as the us government evaluates possible substantial changes to fannie mae and freddie mac 
moody s also downgraded the senior debt rating of radian group to caa from ba our current ratings and the threat of further ratings actions could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
see risk factors we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise 
overview of business results as a seller of credit protection  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the production environment and credit performance of our underlying insured assets 
the prolonged downturn in the housing and related credit markets  characterized by a decline in home prices in certain markets  deteriorating credit performance of mortgage and other assets and reduced liquidity for many participants in the mortgage and financial services industries  has had  and we believe will continue to have  a significant negative impact on the operating environment and results of operations for each of our business segments 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding our ultimate loss performance 
the potential for a deepening and prolonged recession in the us  including high unemployment rates or a delay in any meaningful economic recovery  may add further stress on the performance of our insured assets 
conversely  our performance may be positively impacted by private and governmental initiatives to support homeowners and to stimulate the economy and by a near term stabilization of the economy and the housing market 
mortgage insurance traditional mortgage insurance defaults 
high unemployment and continued weakness in the us housing and mortgage credit markets throughout resulted in a increase in first lien primary defaults from  at december  to  at december  overall  the underlying trend of higher defaults continues to be driven by poor performance of our late through the first half of books of business 
defaults have been increasing across all our mortgage insurance product lines  including our insured portfolio of prime  first liens 
in addition  we have observed a slowdown in mortgage foreclosures  and consequently a slowdown in claims submitted to us  due to the moratoriums imposed by various government entities and lenders  which has contributed to the increase in our overall default inventory 
this increase in defaults was partially mitigated by a  reduction in defaults relating to 
table of contents a large first lien termination completed in december as a result of the slowing of new delinquencies  we expect the delinquency level to stabilize throughout  and decrease by the end of loss provision 
in addition to the increase in new defaults during  our mortgage insurance loss provision during continued to be negatively impacted by higher loan balances on delinquent loans  the aging of our delinquent loans  and a decrease in the rate at which defaults are cured before moving to claim cure rate 
during  our mortgage insurance loss provision was positively impacted by our loss management efforts 
our loss reserve estimate incorporates our recent experience with respect to the number of claims that we are denying and the number of insurance certificates that we are rescinding due to fraud or other factors 
our current level of rescissions and denials is significantly higher than historical levels  which we believe reflects the larger concentration of poorly underwritten loans primarily originated during late through the first half of that are in our default inventory  as well as our efforts to examine more claims 
we expect this increased level of rescissions and denials to continue in the current environment  in particular with respect to our late through the first half of insured portfolios 
see risk factors insurance rescissions and claim denials may not continue at the levels we have recently experienced 
total mortgage insurance claims paid were million for for  excluding the impact of first and second lien terminations as well as proceeds received from captive terminations  claims paid were million  compared to million in legislation and loan modification programs by the us treasury and certain of our lender customers aimed at mitigating the current housing downturn had a positive impact on our business by reducing the number of defaults going to claim 
many of these programs are still being implemented and we cannot be certain of their ultimate impact on our business  results of operations  or the timing of this impact 
in addition  various government entities and lenders have imposed moratoriums on foreclosures  some of which have recently been lifted 
we expect to experience an increase in claims paid in to approximately billion as these moratoriums expire or are lifted 
see risk factors loan modification and other similar programs may not provide us with a material benefit 
smart home captives 
we protected against some of our losses relating to riskier primary mortgage insurance products that we insured by reinsuring our exposure through transactions referred to as smart home that effectively transferred risk to investors in the capital markets 
approximately of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force was included in smart home transactions at december  our mortgage insurance provision for losses for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to recoverables from smart home 
ceded losses recoverable related to smart home were million at december  in addition to smart home  we have transferred a substantial portion of our mortgage insurance risk to captive reinsurance companies affiliated with our lender customers 
all of our captive reinsurance arrangements are operating on a run off basis  meaning that no new business is being placed in these captives 
we expect that some of the captives that are now in run off will be terminated 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to recoverables from captive reinsurance transactions 
ceded losses recoverable on captive reinsurance transactions were million at december  we have received total cash reinsurance recoveries from smart home and captive reinsurance arrangements of approximately million  which includes approximately million received upon termination of certain captive reinsurance transactions in in some instances  we anticipate that the ultimate recoveries from the captive reinsurers will be greater than the assets currently held by the segregated trusts established for each captive reinsurer 
recorded recoverables  however  are limited to the current trust balance 
we are approaching the maximum amount that we may record as recoverables under our smart home and captive reinsurance arrangements  therefore  we expect a limited amount of incremental recoverables booked from these arrangements in future years 
most of the actual cash recoveries  however  will be received over the next few years 

table of contents new insurance written 
primary new insurance written decreased by for the year ended december   compared to this decrease is mainly the result of our more restrictive underwriting guidelines  a reduction of new business writings due to our mortgage insurance capital limitations  the absence of a secondary market for mortgage securitizations other than the gses and most prominently  increased competition from the federal housing administration fha  which is currently insuring over of the total mortgage insurance market 
starting in  we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting guidelines aimed at improving the long term risk profile and profitability of our business 
as a result of these changes  we have experienced improvement in the credit profile of our mortgage insurance portfolio 
for the year ended december   of our new business production was categorized as prime business  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  fair isaac and company fico scores for the borrowers of these insured mortgages have increased  while the loan to value ltv on these mortgages had decreased  meaning that borrowers generally are making larger down payments in connection with the more recent mortgages that we are insuring 
persistency 
the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on our books after any month period  was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the december mi termination  the persistency rate for would have been 
this increase was mainly due to a decline in refinancing activity as a result of home price depreciation  tighter underwriting standards and an overall decrease in the lending capacity among mortgage originators 
we expect that persistency rates will continue to remain at elevated levels as long as the current disruption in the housing and mortgage credit markets continues 
discontinued non traditional products nims 
our total principal exposure to nims was million at december   all of which we expect to result in credit losses 
we began paying principal claims on our insured nims during and expect that most claim payments will be made in and the fair value of our total net liabilities related to nims as of december  was million and is recorded as derivative assets and vie debt 
our carrying value includes the net present value of our total expected credit losses and incorporates the market s perception of our non performance risk  in accordance with the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements 
the difference between our total expected credit losses and the carrying value of our net liability is million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining life of the nims as the discount is accreted 
as part of our loss mitigation initiatives  we purchased additional nims that we guarantee during  which reduced our exposure by million at december  we repurchased an additional million of nims in january we expect to continue to purchase additional nims at a discount in in order to mitigate our ultimate losses 
second liens 
as of december   our total exposure to second liens was million  down from million at december   primarily due to the negotiated settlement of certain second lien mortgage insurance transactions in our second lien loss reserves declined during to million at december  our premium deficiency reserve for second liens also decreased during by million  resulting in a premium deficiency reserve for second liens of million at december  as of december   we had total reserves comprised of loss reserves and premium deficiency reserves of million against our second lien portfolio  or of the total exposure 
our remaining exposure to second liens primarily represents the seasoned stable performing portion of our portfolio 

table of contents mortgage insurance cds 
we no longer have any exposure to domestic mortgage insurance cds 
during  we terminated all of our domestic mortgage insurance cds transactions 
the settlement payments were approximately equal to the fair value of the terminated transactions 
our exposure to international mortgage insurance cds at december  consisted of one cds referencing residential mortgage backed securities rmbs related to mortgage loans in the netherlands 
this cds contains prime  low ltv mortgages 
our remaining exposure to this transaction was approximately million as of december   with remaining subordination of million 
our insurance covers several tranches in this transaction  which are rated between bbb and aaa  with over half of our exposure in the aaa category 
this transaction is performing well  and we do not currently expect to pay claims on this transaction 
financial guaranty net par outstanding 
our financial guaranty net par outstanding decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this reduction in net par outstanding was primarily due to the ambac commutation billion  along with negotiated settlements of certain cdos  prepayments or refundings of public finance transactions and the amortization or scheduled maturity of our insured portfolio 
in light of our decision in to discontinue writing new business for the foreseeable future  we expect our net par outstanding to continue to decrease as our financial guaranty portfolio matures and as we seek to prudently reduce our financial guaranty risk in force 
credit deterioration 
the credit quality of our financial guaranty insurance portfolio deteriorated during our internal ratings on our total cdo portfolio migrated downward during with of our net par exposure internally rated bbb or below as of december   compared to as of december  our directly insured corporate cdo portfolio  representing of the net par outstanding of our total cdo portfolio at december   remains highly rated based on our internal ratings  with of this exposure rated aaa  and only of such exposure rated below investment grade big 
our portfolio of directly insured bonds trups bonds  each representing a senior tranche of a cdo comprised mainly of trups  further deteriorated during the second half of  with subordination levels in these transactions being reduced by a significant number of defaults and interest deferrals by issuers of trups in the cdo collateral pools 
as a result of this deterioration  one of our insured trups bonds defaulted due to interest payment shortfalls in october see results of operations financial guaranty financial guaranty exposure information below for additional information regarding material changes in the credit performance of our trups cdo portfolio 
the collateral underlying our four cdos of cmbs transactions has also experienced deterioration during there has been an increase in the delinquencies in the cmbs collateral pools 
as of december   total delinquencies ranged from to across the four cdos of cmbs  an increase from a range of to as of december  however  even if all current delinquencies resulted in defaults  substantial subordination would remain 
of the cmbs tranches comprising the collateral for our insured cdo of cmbs transactions  of them have been downgraded by moody s from aaa to between aa and ba and have been downgraded from aaa to between aa and b by s p 
despite this deterioration in the underlying collateral  on our insured cdo of cmbs transactions as a whole remain highly rated internally 
exposure to subprime  prime  alt a and second to pay domestic rmbs in our financial guaranty insured portfolio outside of our insured cdo portfolio was reduced during  primarily due to the ambac commutation 
in particular  exposure to rmbs supported by home equity lines of credit collateral pools declined from million at june  to million at december  our 
table of contents big exposure based on our internal ratings to domestic rmbs outside of our insured cdo portfolio also was reduced during the second half of due to the ambac commutation a reduction from of net par outstanding as of june  to as of december  
all below investment grade domestic rmbs exposure is on our watch list and reserves have been established for these transactions  as appropriate 
credit deterioration in our insured public finance portfolio continued during  primarily due to the stress from general adverse economic conditions 
in particular  the financial condition of obligors in our insured healthcare and long term care portfolios weakened due to declining cash positions and operating and investment losses 
credits in these sectors have responded to these challenges by taking measures to reduce costs  improve revenues  and implement strategies designed to permit them to better adapt to changing and difficult economic conditions in the future 
our insured education portfolio experienced stress during the year due to declining philanthropy and investment returns 
this has pressured these institutions to manage their enrollment and associated revenue  expenses and cash balances 
the lagging impact of the economic downturn on the fiscal performance of state and local governments continues to be realized 
however  the states and municipalities included within our government related insured credits have generally been able to manage this stress to date 
our insured public finance portfolio remains highly rated  with rated investment grade at least bbb internally as of december   a slight decline from as of december  we expect that credit deterioration will continue in  as public finance issuers use accumulated cash balances and surpluses to address budget shortfalls and operating deficiencies

in  the comparable first and second loss submitted claims rescinded or denied were million and million  respectively 
these amounts also include a small amount of submitted claims that were subsequently withdrawn by the insured 
we believe that the elevated levels of insurance rescissions and claim denials and the elevated levels of defaults are related  and are in part the result of underwriting deficiencies which existed during through the first half of our mortgage insurance loss provision was also reduced by approximately million due to the termination of certain captive reinsurance transactions and the termination of first and second lien transactions

excluding defaults without a related reserve  which are discussed in the footnotes to the default 
table of contents statistics primary insurance  the average loss reserve per default was   and  at december   and  respectively

claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
historically  relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
claim activity on prime loans has historically reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
based on these trends  approximately of our primary risk in force and approximately of our pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
at december   the comparable percentages were and  respectively 
the insurance we wrote from through the first half of has experienced default and claim activity sooner than has been the case for our historical books of business 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the cancellation rate of existing business  it is also difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 

table of contents the following table shows the top five states with the highest claims paid and the highest number of defaults for the periods indicated december in thousands states with highest claims paid first lien california florida arizona michigan georgia states with highest number of defaults florida california illinois georgia michigan claims paid in california  florida and arizona have increased significantly as home price depreciation in those states has been greater than the national average 
california and florida also contain a higher percentage of alt a loans  which have had a higher claim frequency 
we believe that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising  and will continue to rise  due to the weak industrial sector of the economy in those areas and significant home price depreciation in those states 
a much higher level of claims exist in michigan  as problems with the domestic auto industry and related industries have depressed economic growth  employment and housing prices in that state 
deteriorating markets in california and florida  where non prime and non traditional mortgage products such as arms and interest only loans are prevalent and where home prices have fallen significantly  have resulted in significant losses in our mortgage insurance business 
during the prolonged period of rising home prices that preceded the current downturn in the us housing market  very few mortgage delinquencies and claims were attributable to insured loans in california  despite the significant growth during this period of riskier  non traditional mortgage products in this state 
as mortgage credit performance in california and florida has deteriorated  given the size of these markets  our loss experience has been significantly affected and will continue to be negatively affected if conditions do not improve or continue to deteriorate

the following provides additional information regarding certain transactions in our financial guaranty portfolio with net par outstanding in excess of million we have provided million net par outstanding of credit protection as of december   on the senior most tranche of a cdo of abs transaction  with the underlying collateral consisting predominantly of mezzanine tranches of mbs 
as of december   million or of the collateral pool is currently rated below investment grade  and million or of the collateral pool has defaulted 
due to the substantial deterioration of the underlying collateral  we currently expect to begin paying claims related to interest shortfalls on this transaction in however  due to the structure of this transaction  we do not expect to pay claims related to principal shortfalls until sometime between and the legal final maturity date for the transaction in although losses for this transaction are difficult to estimate  we currently believe that our ultimate claim payments in respect of principal for this transaction could be substantially all of our total principal exposure 
this transaction is currently rated cc internally  cc by s p and ca by moody s 
we have reinsured several primary financial guaranty insurers obligations with respect to million in net par outstanding related to jefferson county  alabama the county sewer bonds 
the county and certain primary insurers have entered into forbearance agreements with the liquidity banks that prevented the banks from  among other things  demanding payment of accrued default rate interest under their liquidity agreements 
the last of these agreements was entered into in february the primary insurers have been working with the county and other parties to structure a resolution to the 
table of contents financial problems of the county s sewer system  and in  a settlement had been proposed 
neither the county nor the alabama state legislature has taken actions to date that would support the implementation of the proposed settlement  and we do not believe it is likely that the proposed settlement or any similar settlement will be consummated during the county s sewer system operations generated sufficient revenue in to pay interest on its outstanding debt and on bonds purchased by the primary insurers through claims paid on the policies  together with a regularly scheduled installment of principal due on february  in april  one of the insurers of the county s sewer bonds  syncora guarantee inc syncora  suspended all claims payments following an order by the new york insurance department nyid 
in november  another insurer of the county s sewer bonds  financial guaranty insurance company fgic  also suspended all claims payments following an order by the nyid 
these actions suspend  but do not terminate  any reinsurance claims that such primary insurers may have against reinsurers  including us 
if either or both of these primary insurers go into receivership  reinsurers would only be required to pay their assumed portion of any claims  but would not be liable for claims retained by such primary insurer or ceded to another reinsurer 
however  these suspensions could affect the ability of the primary insurers of the county s sewer bonds including fgic and syncora to reach a settlement or the terms thereof  which could materially affect our ultimate net claim liability 
at december   we had million of loss reserves for this transaction  and we have paid million of claims on this transaction to date 
as of december   we provided credit protection on trups bonds 
our credit protection on these trups bonds was conducted through separate cds contracts  meaning that with respect to five of these trups bonds at december   we entered into two separate cds contracts each with a different counterparty covering the same trups bond 
many of the issuers in our insured trups bonds have been negatively affected by the recent u 
s economic recession 
certain of these issuers have defaulted on their obligation to pay interest on their trups or have voluntarily chosen to defer interest payments  which is permissible for up to five years 
since we believe there is a significant likelihood that trups that are subject to interest deferrals will ultimately result in a default  we closely monitor deferrals as well as defaults in assessing the subordination remaining beneath our insured trups bonds 
ten of the trups bonds that we insure representing a net par outstanding of billion were internally rated big as of december  the fair value of our insured trups transactions  which are accounted for as derivatives  was a liability of million as of december  one of our insured trups bonds with approximately million of exposure began experiencing interest shortfalls in october these shortfalls were primarily due to a large number of deferrals of interest with respect to the trups collateral  combined with significant cash payments related to interest rate hedges 
due to a combination of the current interest rate environment and an excess of hedge notional amounts over the principal amount of performing fixed rate collateral  these cash payments have contributed significantly to the overall interest shortfall in this transaction 
as of december   we have paid an aggregate of million in interest shortfall claims on this trups bond  and we expect to continue to pay additional interest shortfall claims 
in january  we eliminated million of our exposure to this trups bond by commuting one of the cds contracts covering this bond 
our aggregate net loss with respect to such commutation approximated our fair value of this derivative liability at december  after giving effect to the january commutation  our weighted average internal rating for our insured trups bonds was bb 
based on current projections  we expect to pay ultimate principal losses on two of our trups bonds the trups bond described above representing million in exposure after taking into effect the january transaction and one other trups bond representing million in exposure 
based on our current cash flow projections  we believe that the total principal claims that we will be required to pay in respect of these two trups bonds will constitute a material amount of our current net par outstanding for these bonds 
it should be noted that even relatively small changes in trups default rates 
table of contents or economic conditions from current projections could have a material impact on the timing and amount of cash available to make interest and principal payments on the underlying trups 
therefore  the occurrence  timing and duration of any event of default and the amount of any ultimate principal or interest shortfall payment are uncertain and very difficult to predict 
in addition to credit risk  we also potentially face liquidity risk with respect to certain of our cds contracts 
after giving effect to the january commutation of one of our cds contracts as discussed above  we currently have eight cds contracts representing a total net par outstanding of million as of december  pursuant to which we may be required to pay our counterparty the outstanding par amount of our insured trups bonds a liquidity claim 
a liquidity claim may arise if an event of default under the trups bond eg  a failure to pay interest or a breach of covenants requiring the maintenance of a certain level of performing collateral existed as of the termination date of the cds contract 
the termination dates of our cds contracts currently range between and  but automatically extend for additional one year increments but no later than the maturity date of trups cdo unless terminated by our counterparty 
if we are required to pay a liquidity claim  our counterparty would be obligated under the cds to either deliver the insured trups bond to us or to periodically pay us cash  in an amount equal to any amounts paid in principal and interest on the insured trups bond 
we may be required to pay a liquidity claim on the one remaining cds contract relating to the trups bond that defaulted in october this cds contract is currently scheduled to terminate in july we are exploring loss mitigation alternatives with respect to this trups bond  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk to this bond 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss 
our financial guaranty segment s net income for was million  compared to a net loss of million for the increase in net income for was mainly due to the large positive impact the change in fair value of derivative instruments resulting from our implementation of the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and higher net premiums earned as a result of an increase in prepayments or refundings of public finance obligations

our financial guaranty segment s net premiums earned in were million  a million or increase compared to million in included in net premiums earned for were premiums related to prepayments or refundings of public finance obligations of million compared to million for premiums earned in were reduced by million due to the recaptures of a portion of our reinsurance portfolio by certain reinsurance customers in net investment income

as of january  radian re bermuda no longer has any insurance liabilities 
radian asset assurance and raal are parties to a capital maintenance agreement pursuant to which radian asset assurance has agreed to maintain raal s capital at a level not less that of the equivalent of the required margin of solvency pursuant to the regulations of the financial services authority fsa  raal s uk regulator  and to ensure that at all times raal has sufficient cash resources for the timely honoring of its contractual obligations 
radian asset assurance is not required to make any payments that would cause it to be in breach of its own minimum capital requirements  and certain payments by radian asset assurance pursuant to this agreement are specifically subject to 
table of contents the prior approval of the new york superintendent of insurance 
we are in the process of winding down raal s operations 
radian group and amerin guaranty are parties to a guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that radian group will make sufficient funds available to amerin guaranty to ensure that amerin guaranty has a minimum of million of statutory surplus every calendar quarter 
securities regulations became effective in that impose enhanced disclosure requirements on issuers of abs including mbs 
to allow our mortgage insurance customers to comply with these regulations  we typically have been required  depending on the amount of credit enhancement we are providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in these transactions or a full and unconditional holding company level guarantee for our insurance subsidiaries obligations in such transactions 
to date  radian group has guaranteed two structured transactions for radian guaranty with approximately million of remaining credit exposure 
in addition to the foregoing  we use reinsurance from affiliated companies to allow radian guaranty to remain in compliance with insurance regulations that limit the amount of risk that a mortgage insurance company may retain on a single loan to of the indebtedness of the insured 
in february  radian guaranty  in order to further support its capital position and risk to capital ratio  entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement with radian insurance 
under this agreement  radian guaranty transferred approximately billion of risk in force to radian insurance  consisting of policies on loans that are relatively high credit quality 
this pool of loans consists of a higher concentration of fixed rate  prime  high fico loans than our overall portfolio 
funding of compensation programs 
under our change of control agreements with our executive officers  upon a change of control of radian group or radian asset assurance  as the case may be  we are required to fund an irrevocable rabbi trust to the extent of our obligations under these agreements 
the total maximum amount that we would be required to place in trust is approximately million as of december  in addition  in the event of a change of control under our existing cash based incentive plans  we would be required to pay approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements the qualifying special purpose entities qspe framework is applicable when an entity transfers sells financial assets to a special purpose entity spe meeting certain criteria defined in the accounting standard regarding accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
these criteria are designed to ensure that the activities of the entity are essentially predetermined at the inception of the vehicle and that the transferor of the financial assets cannot exercise control over the entity and the assets therein 
entities meeting these criteria are not consolidated by the transferor  or other counterparties  as long as they do not have the unilateral ability to liquidate or to cause the entity to no longer meet the qspe criteria 
our interests in qspes may be accounted for as insurance contracts or financial guaranty derivatives 
for insurance contracts with qspes  we record reserves for losses and lae  and for derivative interests in qspes  we record changes in the fair value as a corresponding derivative asset or liability 
we do not record the underlying assets or liabilities of qspes on our balance sheets 
when an spe does not meet the qspe criteria  consolidation is assessed pursuant to the accounting standard regarding consolidation of variable interest entities 
under this standard  a vie is defined as an entity that lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity s operations  and or has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity s losses or the right to receive the entity s returns 
this standard requires a variable interest holder ie  a counterparty to a vie to consolidate the vie if that party will receive the majority of the expected residual returns of the vie  absorb a majority of the expected losses of the vie  or both 
this party is considered the primary beneficiary 

table of contents spes and vies are a part of our non traditional mortgage insurance products as well as our financial guaranty business 
our primary involvement with spes relates to transactions in which we provide a financial guaranty to one or more classes of beneficial interest holders in the spe 
underlying collateral in the spes typically includes residential or commercial mortgages  consumer receivables  securities and other financial assets sold to an spe and repackaged into securities or similar beneficial interests 
spes may also be used to create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors and as a means of transferring risk  such as our smart home transactions 
we consolidate those vies in which we are the primary beneficiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of spes 
certain other spes do not meet the requirements of a qspe  because all of their activities are not sufficiently limited or they have entered into certain non qualifying transactions 
in some circumstances  a qspe may not be exempt from consolidation if we have the unilateral ability to make significant changes to the qspe 
we follow the criteria under this standard in determining whether we should consolidate such entities 
a determination of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity is initially made at the time we become involved with the entity 
in those instances where we are the primary beneficiary  the assets and liabilities of the vie are consolidated on our balance sheets 
certain reconsideration events may occur which cause us to re assess our initial determination of whether an entity is a vie or non vie 
if the entity becomes a vie  we perform an assessment of consolidation of that entity 
those reconsideration events generally are the entity s governance structure is changed such that either the characteristics or adequacy of equity at risk are changed  or expected returns or losses are reallocated among the participating parties within the entity  the equity investment or some part thereof is returned to the equity investors and other interests become exposed to expected returns or losses  additional activities are undertaken or assets acquired by the entity that were beyond those anticipated previously  participants in the entity acquire or sell interests in the entity  and the entity receives additional equity at risk or curtails its activities in a way that changes the expected returns or losses 
mortgage insurance nims we have provided credit enhancement on nims bonds 
a nims bond represents the securitization of a portion of the excess cash flow and prepayment penalties from a mbs comprised mostly of subprime mortgages 
the majority of this excess cash flow consists of the spread between the interest rate on the mbs and the interest generated from the underlying mortgage collateral 
historically  issuers of mbs would have earned this excess interest over time as the collateral aged  but market efficiencies enabled these issuers to sell a portion of their residual interests to investors in the form of nims bonds 
typically  the issuer retained a significant portion of the residual interests  which are subordinated to the nims bond in a first loss position  so that the issuer would suffer losses associated with any shortfalls in residual cash flows before the nims bond experienced any losses 
nims bonds have been susceptible to the disruption in the housing market and the subprime mortgage market 
at december   all nims transactions required consolidation in our financial statements such that there currently exists no off balance sheet exposure 
see overview of business results mortgage insurance discontinued non traditional products nims for information regarding our total loss expectations with respect to nims 
our nims are generally structured as qspes 
there are certain circumstances and triggers outside of our control  however  which would give us the ability to call some or all of the outstanding nims bonds 
the effective control that we attain if the call option is triggered  renders the qspe a vie under the accounting standard regarding consolidation of vies 
we then assess whether we are required to consolidate the vie 
at december   there were such transactions that required consolidation in our 
table of contents financial statements  which resulted in consolidation of million of the total maximum exposure of million 
the consolidated nims vie debt is recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
the following is a summary of our exposure to the nims underlying trust assets both consolidated and off balance sheet nims trusts at december  and december  december  december  in millions vie assets total nims trust assets maximum principal exposure total nims trust assets maximum principal exposure nims smart home in  we developed a program referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these reinsurance transactions  through the use of spe structures  effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
since august  we have completed four smart home reinsurance transactions 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million each transaction began with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then entered into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we do not hold any of the credit linked notes issued as part of this structure  therefore  we have no significant variable interests in the structures  and are not subject to consolidation under this standard 
see overview of business results mortgage insurance traditional mortgage insurance above for further discussion 
financial guaranty financial guaranty contracts written with spes may be written directly with the spe or indirectly through a cds done with a primary financial guarantor who issues a financial guaranty to the beneficial interest holders in the spe 
these spes are commonly used in cdo transactions where portfolio managers are permitted to buy and sell assets 
as a guarantor of beneficial interests held by third party investors  we have been involved with spes in our financial guaranty business 
the guarantees are generally financial guarantees of principal and interest payments to beneficial interest holders 
our guarantees are generally issued on highly rated senior securities issued by these spes and are not designed to absorb a significant portion of the expected losses or expected returns of the spes 
accordingly  we do not consolidate these spes 
an increase in losses within the spe structure is not an event that would require us to reconsider consolidation under this standard 
however  if any of the trigger events discussed above were to occur and we were required to reconsider our variable interests in the spe  there is an increased risk that we may be required to consolidate some of these spes 
this is primarily due to the deterioration in subordination of the underlying collateral that has occurred since our initial determination  made at inception of the vies  that we were not the primary beneficiary 

table of contents the following table sets forth our total assets and maximum exposure to loss associated with significant financial guaranty variable interests in vies as of december for the years indicated total assets maximum exposure total assets maximum exposure in millions abs other structured finance total liquidity and capital resources radian group short term liquidity radian group serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own 
radian group s principal liquidity demands for the next months include funds for i the payment of certain corporate expenses which are expected to be fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  ii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt which are expected to be fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iii payments to our insurance subsidiaries in october under our tax sharing agreement  iv potential capital support for our insurance subsidiaries  and v the payment of dividends on our common stock 
at december   radian group had immediately available directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and marketable securities of approximately million 
corporate expenses and interest expense 
radian group has expense sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including interest expense on our long term debt 
payments of such corporate expenses for the next months  other than interest payments  are expected to be approximately million  which is expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
for the same period  payments of interest on our long term debt are expected to be approximately million  which also is expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
these expense sharing arrangements  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be changed at any time 
tax payments 
under our current tax sharing agreement between radian group and its subsidiaries  our subsidiaries are required to pay to radian group  on a quarterly basis  amounts representing their estimated separate company tax liability for the current tax year 
radian group is required to refund to each subsidiary any amount that such subsidiary overpaid to radian group for a taxable year  as well as any amount that the subsidiary could utilize through existing carryback provisions of the internal revenue code irc had such subsidiary filed its federal tax return on a separate company basis 
in october  we satisfied radian group s obligation to pay approximately million to radian guaranty by transferring to it our ownership interest in sherman  which required no cash payment 
in addition  based upon our december  tax provision  we believe that radian group will be required to pay approximately million to radian guaranty by october  of which million was prepaid in february the amount due by october could decrease if actual taxable losses in are less than projected or increase if actual tax losses in are worse than projected 
further  if radian guaranty realizes a tax loss in  radian group could be required to make an additional payment to radian guaranty in october  up to a maximum of million 
all amounts estimated to be paid under our tax sharing agreement are dependent on the extent of tax losses in current and future periods  are based upon current irc provisions which govern the usage of such tax losses  and may change upon the filing of our consolidated federal income tax returns 
our tax sharing agreement may not be changed without the pre approval of the applicable state insurance departments for certain of the insurance subsidiaries that are party to the agreement 

table of contents in november  new tax legislation was enacted that provides an election to extend the existing carryback period for applicable net operating losses incurred in either or but not both years from two years to up to five years 
while a complete analysis of the overall impact has yet to be determined  we do not believe that the newly enacted provisions will have a material impact on radian group s consolidated federal income tax position 
we are also currently evaluating radian group s obligations under the tax sharing agreement in light of this new legislation 
if we elect to extend our carryback period pursuant to this legislation  we believe it is possible that we could be required to pay additional amounts of approximately million to one or more of our subsidiaries under the tax sharing agreement 
during the current period  certain of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries other than radian guaranty  incurred estimated net operating losses on a tax basis that  if computed on a separate company return basis  could not be utilized through existing carryback provisions of the irc 
as a result  we are not currently obligated to reimburse them for their respective unutilized tax losses 
however  if in a future period  any of these subsidiaries generate taxable income such that they are able to realize their individual net operating loss carryforward under the irc  then we will be obligated under the tax sharing agreement to fund such subsidiary s share of the net operating loss that has been utilized on a consolidated group tax return basis 
each of these subsidiaries has incurred significant losses in the recent past and are not expected to generate income in the future as a result of their insured portfolios of mortgage collateral 
capital support for subsidiaries 
radian group could be required to provide capital support for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries if required by insurance regulators  the gses or the rating agencies 
in  radian group contributed million to amerin guaranty to satisfy its surplus requirements 
during  radian group contributed million to cmac of texas and million to amerin guaranty 
dividends 
in july  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share 
assuming that our common stock outstanding remains constant at  shares the number of shares outstanding at december   we would pay approximately million in the aggregate for our quarterly dividends for the next months 
dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are radian group s principal sources of cash 
following the transfer of sherman to radian guaranty in the fourth quarter of  any dividends from sherman will now be made directly to radian guaranty and not to radian group 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance department approval 
in light of ongoing losses in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  we do not anticipate that these subsidiaries will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the extent radian asset assurance is permitted to issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to its direct parent  radian guaranty  and not to radian group 
in september  radian asset assurance entered into a contingent capital transaction pursuant to which three custodial trusts issued an aggregate of million in cps million by each custodial trust to various holders 
as part of this transaction  radian asset securities inc radian asset securities  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a separate perpetual put option agreement with each custodial trust  and radian asset assurance entered into three corresponding perpetual put option agreements with radian asset securities 
the custodial trusts were created as a vehicle for providing capital support to radian asset assurance by allowing radian asset assurance to obtain access to additional capital  at its discretion  through the exercise of one or more put options and the corresponding exercise of one or more radian asset securities put options 
upon exercise of their respective rights under the put options  radian asset assurance would issue its preferred stock to radian asset securities and the custodial trusts would purchase radian asset securities preferred stock 
the preferred stock of radian asset assurance and radian asset securities have substantially identical terms 
our 
table of contents put options are perpetual in nature  allowing us to put our preferred stock solely at our discretion and call our preferred stock subsequent to its issuance 
specifically  there is no limit to the number of times that radian asset assurance and  correspondingly  radian asset securities may put its preferred stock to radian asset securities and  correspondingly  to the custodial trusts  fully redeem its preferred stock from radian asset securities and  correspondingly  from the custodial trusts  and put it back to radian asset securities and  correspondingly  to the custodial trusts 
in november  radian group commenced three separate tender offers to purchase the cps issued by each of the three custodial trusts 
on december   radian group successfully completed tender offers to purchase the cps issued by two of the three custodial trusts 
in the tender  radian group purchased million and million  respectively  of the million face amount of the cps issued by each of these two custodial trusts 
we purchased the cps at a purchase price equal to of the face amount of such cps 
we have various options relating to the cps  which include with respect to each custodial trust radian asset assurance and radian asset securities exercising their respective rights under the put options and issuing their preferred stock to radian asset securities and to the custodial trust  respectively  radian asset assurance causing the dissolution of the custodial trust  resulting in the distribution of the assets held by the custodial trust to the cps holders 
as of the date of this report  if radian asset assurance were to cause the dissolution of the two custodial trusts for which we have bought cps  radian group  as a holder of the cps for such custodial trusts  would receive million in cash from these trusts  or we may seek to purchase the cps not held by us  through a tender offer or otherwise 
at december   we did not have the intent to sell any debt securities in an unrealized loss position and determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery or maturity 
we expect to fund radian group s short term liquidity needs with existing cash and marketable securities  cash received under the tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries and potentially cash received upon dissolution of the custodial trusts in which we hold cps 
if the cash radian group receives from its tax and expense sharing arrangements is insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  radian group may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity  or by selling assets  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
radian group long term liquidity our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next months is the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt and the potential payment due to radian guaranty in october under our tax sharing arrangement as discussed above 
at december   approximately million in principal amount of our long term debt was due in june and million was due in each of and in january  we repurchased an additional million of our june debt  reducing the current principal amount outstanding of these debentures to million 
we may continue to redeem or repurchase some or all of our outstanding debt if circumstances are favorable to us 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing or amount of any potential repurchases  which will depend on a number of factors  including our capital and liquidity needs 
we expect to meet the long term liquidity needs of radian group through available cash  the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities  the sale of assets or from dividends from our subsidiaries  and potentially cash received upon dissolution of the custodial trusts in which we hold cps 
the current downturn in the credit markets has created a situation where traditional sources of debt financing such as banks have significantly restricted access to credit and the public debt markets have been volatile 
as a result  we may not be able to refinance our existing long term debt on favorable terms  if at all 
we expect to be able to repay our june 
table of contents debt with currently available funds or amounts received upon dissolution of the cps trusts  but cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms  if at all  to satisfy or refinance our future liquidity requirements for our long term debt due in and we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 

this registration statement has been declared effective by the sec and will allow us  subject to market conditions  over the next three years to issue up to billion of the securities covered by the registration statement  including common stock  preferred stock  debt and certain other securities 
we are currently contemplating a variety of options to improve our long term liquidity  including raising capital through one or more registered and or private offerings of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital or improve our liquidity on favorable terms  if at all  and any such arrangement will involve costs and may have certain negative consequences for us and our constituents 
these consequences could include a dilutive effect on current equity holders and increased costs of leverage and associated limitations on the operations of the business  as well as the up front costs of the transactions 
mortgage insurance the principal liquidity requirements of our mortgage insurance business include the payment of claims  operating expenses  including those allocated from radian group  and taxes 
the principal sources of liquidity in our mortgage insurance business are insurance premiums  net investment income  cash dividends from radian asset assurance and sherman  and potential payments from radian group under our tax allocation agreement 
our mortgage insurance business has incurred significant losses during the past three years due to the current housing and related credit market downturn 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with a portion of the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that any shortfall can be funded from sales of short term marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of short term marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance business 
in  in light of the expected future losses by radian guaranty  we determined it was necessary to provide additional capital to radian guaranty in order to maintain adequate risk to capital ratios  leverage ratios and surplus requirements as well as to protect its insurance financial strength ratings 
in addition to protecting our financial strength ratings  additional capital is an important component of our plan to improve our ratings with s p and moody s over a time period that is acceptable to us  as well as being important to the gses and our lender counterparties 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  radian group contributed its equity interest in radian asset assurance to radian guaranty  which allows radian guaranty to include radian asset assurance s statutory capital in the calculation of its statutory capital 
as of december   radian asset assurance maintained claims paying resources of billion  including a statutory surplus of approximately billion 
during  radian asset assurance paid a dividend of million to radian guaranty and based on current projections  we currently expect radian asset assurance will have the capacity to issue another dividend of approximately million to radian guaranty in june which does not require the prior approval from the new york insurance commissioner 
the amount  if any  and timing of radian asset assurance s dividend paying capability will depend in part  on the performance of our insured financial guaranty portfolio  including the payment of claims or any agreement to make commutation payments to remove exposures from our books 
if the exposure in our financial guaranty business is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture of business from the primary customers in our financial guaranty reinsurance business or otherwise  such as the ambac commutation  which reduced radian asset assurance s total insured portfolio by approximately  we may have the ability to release capital to our 
table of contents mortgage insurance business more quickly and in a greater amount 
however  if the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  and claim payment obligations arise with respect to one or more transactions  the statutory capital of radian asset assurance and consequently radian guaranty would be reduced in an amount equal to the present value of our expected future net claim liability net of taxes for such transactions 
any reduction in statutory capital would also likely reduce radian asset assurance s capacity to issue dividends to radian guaranty  and radian asset assurance could be restricted from issuing dividends altogether 
see results of operations financial guaranty financial guaranty exposure information above for additional information regarding material changes in the credit performance of our insured financial guaranty portfolio 
see risk factors the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty depends  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio and our financial guaranty portfolio has experienced deterioration as a result of general erosion in credit markets and the overall economy and is susceptible to further deterioration 
as discussed above  we transferred our equity interest in sherman to radian guaranty in the fourth quarter of following this transfer  any dividends from sherman will be paid to radian guaranty  along with the proceeds from any future sale of our interest in sherman 
radian guaranty received a million dividend from sherman in january we cannot provide any assurances that if we were to seek to sell our interest in sherman  that we would be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
financial guaranty the principal short term and long term liquidity requirements of our financial guaranty business include the payments of operating expenses  including those allocated from radian group  claim and commutation payments  taxes and dividends to radian guaranty 
in addition  we have potential liquidity risk with respect to certain of our cdss covering senior tranches of trups cdos representing a total net par outstanding of million as of december  
for more information regarding this potential liquidity risk  see results of operations financial guaranty financial guaranty exposure information above 
the principal sources of liquidity in our financial guaranty business are premium collections  credit enhancement fees on credit derivative contracts and net investment income 
we believe that the cash flows generated by each of our financial guaranty subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have the ability to fund any operating cash flow shortfall from sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio maintained at our operating companies and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of these marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our financial guaranty business

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  management has made estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current 
table of contents economic and housing environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates  assumptions and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
because the use of estimates is inherent in gaap  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the accounting standard regarding accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises specifically excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
however  because of the lack of specific guidance  we establish reserves for mortgage insurance using the guidance contained in this standard  supplemented with other accounting guidance as described below 
in the mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses generally are not established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two consecutive payments 
we also establish reserves for associated lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and the type of loan product to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status 
we also forecast the impact of our loss mitigation efforts in protecting us against fraud  underwriting negligence  breach of representation and warranties  and other items that may give rise to insurance rescissions and claim denials  to help determine the likelihood that a submitted claim will result in a paid claim referred to as the default to claim rate 
lastly  we project the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity 
based on these estimates  we arrive at an appropriate loss reserve at a given point in time 
the default and claim cycle in our mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the servicer 
a default is defined under our master policy as a borrower s failure to make a payment equal to or greater than one monthly regular payment under a loan 
generally  our master policy of insurance requires the insured to notify us of a default within days of the loan s having been in default for three months or the occurrence of an early default in which the borrower fails to make any of the initial monthly payments under a loan so that an amount equal to two monthly payments has not been paid 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the loan has been in default for days 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency  which generally require a larger reserve 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan  and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures historically  a large percentage of defaulted loans have cured  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
we also establish reserves for defaults that we believe to have occurred but that have not been reported to us on a timely basis by lending institutions 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we generally do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
we generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default 
see reserve for premium deficiency below for an exception to this general principle 

table of contents each loan that we insure is identified by product type ie  prime  alt a  subprime and type of insurance ie  primary or pool at the time the loan is initially insured 
different product types typically exhibit different loss behavior 
accordingly  our reserve model applies different ultimate default to claim rates and severities to each product type  taking into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that are inherent in these products  as well as whether we are in a first or second loss position and whether there are deductibles on the insured loans 
we use an actuarial projection methodology called a roll rate analysis to determine the projected ultimate default to claim rates for each product and to produce a reserve point for each product 
as discussed above  the roll rate analysis uses claim payment history for each product to help determine the likelihood that a default will result in a claim and the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim 
the default to claim rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected insurance rescissions and claim denials  which has the effect of reducing our default to claim rates 
recently  we have experienced a significant increase in our insurance rescissions and claim denials for various reasons  including underwriting negligence  fraudulent applications and appraisals  breach of representations and warranties  and inadequate documentation 
our projected default to claim rate was at december   at december  and at december  the increase from to was primarily as a result of higher defaults and severity caused by declining home prices and distress in the residential real estate and credit markets  while the decrease from to was primarily as a result of our estimate of rescissions and denials which is based on actual recent experience 
a key assumption affecting our methodology is that future ultimate default to claim rates and severities will be consistent with our recent experience 
based on the results of our recent claims investigations  we expect our rescission and denial rates to remain at increased levels as long as defaults related to the poor underwriting periods of through the first half of represent a significant percentage of our total default portfolio 
our recent increase in the rate of rescissions and denials may lead to an increased risk of litigation by the lenders and policyholders challenging our right to rescind coverage or deny claims 
such challenges may be made several years after we have rescinded a certificate of insurance or denied a claim 
although we believe that all rescissions and denials identified are valid under our policies  if we are not successful in defending the rescissions and denials in any potential legal actions  we may need to reassume the risk  and reestablish loss reserves for those loans 
the following table shows the mortgage insurance range of loss and lae reserves  and recorded reserves for losses and lae  as of december  and as of december  as of december  loss and lae reserves in millions low high recorded low high recorded mortgage insurance operations reserves for our mortgage insurance business are recorded based on our estimate of loss and lae reserves 
we make regular adjustments to the underlying assumptions in our model as discussed above  and believe the amount generated by our model at december  represents our best estimate of our future losses and lae 
we believe the high and low amounts highlighted in the table above represent a reasonable estimate of the range of possible outcomes around our recorded reserve point for the period indicated 
we considered the sensitivity of first lien loss reserve estimates at december   by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in severity and default to claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every one percentage point change in overall claim severity of unpaid principal balance at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in our overall default to claim rate at december   including our assumptions related to rescissions and denials  we estimated a million change in our loss reserves at december  
table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for our financial guaranty segment at the end of each period indicated december in thousands financial guaranty trade credit reinsurance total in january  we adopted an update to the accounting standard regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance contracts for all non derivative financial guaranty insurance policies 
this standard requires that an insurance enterprise recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default insured event when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial obligation  and when the present value of the expected claim loss will exceed the unearned premium revenue 
the expected claim loss is based on the probability weighted present value of expected net cash outflows to be paid under the policy 
in measuring the claim liability  we develop the present value of expected net cash outflows by using our own assumptions about the likelihood of all possible outcomes  based on information currently available 
we determine the existence of credit deterioration on directly insured policies based on periodic reporting from the insured party  indenture trustee or servicer  or based on our surveillance efforts 
these expected cash outflows are discounted using a risk free rate 
our assumptions about the likelihood of outcomes  expected cash outflows and the appropriate risk free rate are updated each reporting period 
for assumed policies  we rely on information provided by the ceding company as confirmed by us  as well as our specific knowledge of the credit for determining expected loss 
the risk management function in our financial guaranty business is responsible for the identification  analysis  measurement and surveillance of credit  market  legal and operational risk associated with our financial guaranty insurance contracts 
risk management  working with our legal group  is also primarily responsible for claims prevention and loss mitigation strategies 
this discipline is applied during the ongoing monitoring and surveillance of each exposure in the portfolio as well as the point of origination of a transaction 
there are both performing and under performing credits in our financial guaranty portfolio 
performing credits generally have investment grade internal ratings  denoting nominal to moderate credit risk 
however  claim liabilities may be established for performing credits if the expected losses on the credit exceed the unearned premium revenue for the contract based on the present value of the expected net cash outflows 
if our risk management department concludes that a directly insured transaction should no longer be considered performing  it is placed in one of three designated watch list categories for deteriorating credits special mention  intensified surveillance or case reserve 
assumed exposures in financial guaranty s reinsurance portfolio are generally placed in one of these categories if the ceding company for such transaction downgrades it to an equivalent watch list classification 
however  if our financial guaranty risk management group disagrees with the risk rating assigned by the ceding company  we may assign our own risk rating rather than using the risk rating assigned by the ceding company 
prior to the adoption of the accounting standard  we established case and lae reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that had defaulted and allocated non specific and lae reserves for specific credits that we expected to default case reserves and allocated non specific reserves combined represented our allocated reserves 
we also recorded unallocated non specific reserves for other losses on a portfolio basis 
our unallocated non specific reserves were established over time by applying an expected loss ratio to the premiums earned during each reporting period and discretionary adjustments by management as appropriate due to changes in expected frequency and severity of losses 
estimating loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business segments involves significant reliance upon assumptions with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of each potential loss 

table of contents the models  assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults  however  recorded amounts reflect our best estimates 
reserve for premium deficiency insurance enterprises are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve pdr if the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses for a particular product exceeds the net present value for expected future premiums and existing reserves for that product 
we reassess our expectations for premiums  losses and expenses for each of our mortgage insurance businesses at least quarterly and update our premium deficiency analysis accordingly 
for purposes of our premium deficiency analysis  we group our mortgage insurance products into two categories  first lien and second lien 
the following table illustrates our net projected premium excess on our first lien portfolio first lien portfolio in millions december december net present value of expected premiums net present value of expected losses and expenses reserve for premiums and losses established  net of reinsurance recoverables net projected premium excess for our first lien mortgage insurance business  because the combination of the net present value of expected premiums and already established reserves net of reinsurance recoverables exceeds the net present value of expected losses and expenses  a first lien pdr was not required as of december  or expected losses are based on an assumed paid claim rate of approximately on our total primary first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  including on prime  on subprime and on alt a 
while deterioration in the macroeconomic environment has resulted in an increase in expected losses  new business originated during the second half of throughout is expected to be profitable  which has contributed to the overall expected net profitability of our first lien portfolio 
in addition  an increase in estimated rescissions and denials on insured loans as part of our loss mitigation efforts is expected to partially offset the impact of expected defaults and claims 
numerous factors affect our ultimate claim rates  including home price changes  unemployment  the impact of our loss mitigation efforts and interest rates  as well as potential benefits associated with lender and governmental initiatives to modify loans and ultimately reduce foreclosures 
to assess the need for a pdr on our first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  we develop loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to our current risk in force 
this projection is based on recent trends in default experience  severity  and rates of delinquent loans moving to claim such default to claim rates are net of our estimates of rescissions and denials  as well as recent trends in prepayment speeds 
as of december   our modeled loan default projections assume that recently observed new default rates will remain stable through the middle of  and will gradually return to normal historical levels over the subsequent two years 
if our modeled loan default projections were stressed such that recent default trends were to continue until the end of  remain stable through the middle of  and gradually return to normal historical levels over the subsequent three years  we estimate that the combination of the net present value of expected premiums and already established reserves net of reinsurance recoverables would exceed the net present value of expected losses and expenses by approximately billion  therefore  no pdr would be required in this stressed scenario 
to calculate the premium deficiency on our second lien mortgage insurance business  we project future premiums and losses for this business on a transaction by transaction basis  using historical results to help 
table of contents determine future performance for both repayments and claims 
an estimated expense factor is then applied  and the result is discounted using a rate of return that approximates our investment yield 
this net present value  less any existing reserves  is recorded as a premium deficiency and the reserve is updated at least quarterly based on actual results for that quarter  along with updated transaction level projections 
during  the second lien pdr decreased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the normal transfer of premium deficiency reserves to loss reserves and the settlement of second lien transactions at an amount that was less than our previously established pdr 
our second lien portfolio is relatively seasoned  and as a result  we do not believe that future changes in macroeconomic factors will result in significant changes to our current loss projections 
the following table reconciles our mortgage insurance segment s beginning and ending second lien pdr for and in thousands second lien pdr in thousands year ended december year ended december balance at beginning of period incurred losses recognized in loss reserves premiums recognized in earned premiums changes in underlying assumptions accretion of discount and other balance at end of period derivative instruments derivative instruments are recorded at fair value  and changes in fair value are recorded in change in fair value of derivative instruments unless the derivatives qualify as hedges 
if the derivatives qualify as hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
currently  we have no derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
all our derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
our credit protection in the form of cds within both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments  nims derivatives assets and financial guaranty contracts on nims that we do not consolidate  and cps that are not consolidated  are all recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value included in current earnings in our consolidated statements of operations 
we record premiums and origination costs related to our cds and certain other derivative contracts in change in fair value of derivative instruments and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on our consolidated statements of operations 
our classification of these contracts is the same whether we are a direct insurer or we assume these contracts 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements effective january  with respect to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
this accounting standard i defines fair value  ii establishes a framework for measuring fair value and iii expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
there was no cumulative impact on retained earnings as a result of the adoption 
effective january   we adopted the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosures as it relates to non financial assets and non financial liabilities 

table of contents we adopted the accounting standard regarding the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january  we elected to fair value the consolidated nims vie debt and the consolidated cps vie debt at the date that each of these vies were consolidated during and we define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  other than in a forced liquidation 
fair value measurements reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold or transferred in a forced liquidation  the amounts received or paid may be materially different than those determined in accordance with this standard 
when determining the fair value of our liabilities we are required to incorporate into the fair value an adjustment that reflects our own non performance risk 
as our cds spread tightens or widens  the fair value of our liabilities increases and decreases  respectively 
we established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level iii measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below level i unadjusted quoted prices or valuations in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level ii quoted prices or valuations in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  level iii prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the level of market activity in determining the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability  including market value price observations 
for markets in which inputs are not observable or limited  we use significant judgment and assumptions that a typical market participant would use to evaluate the market price of an asset or liability 
these assets and liabilities are classified in level iii of our fair value hierarchy 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
at december   our total level iii assets were approximately of total assets measured at fair value and total level iii liabilities accounted for of total liabilities measured at fair value 
trading securities  hybrid securities  vie debt  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as described in note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all derivative instruments and contracts are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations provided under the contracts 
all changes in fair value of trading securities  hybrid securities  vie debt and derivatives are included in the statements of operations 
the following are descriptions of our valuation methodologies for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
investments us government and agency securities the fair value of us government and agency securities is estimated using observed market transactions  including broker dealer quotes and actual trade activity as a basis for valuation 
us government and agency securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents state and municipal obligations the fair value of state and municipal obligations is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations for normalized market conditions 
evaluation models are used which incorporate bond structure  yield curve  credit spreads  and other factors 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
money market instruments the fair value of money market instruments is based on daily prices which are published and available to all potential investors and market participants 
as such  these securities are categorized in level i of the fair value hierarchy 
corporate bonds and notes the fair value of corporate bonds and notes is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations for normalized market conditions 
spread models are used to incorporate issue and structure characteristics where applicable 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
rmbs the fair value of rmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
cmbs the fair value of cmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
other abs the fair value of other abs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
foreign government securities the fair value of foreign government securities is estimated using observed market yields used to create a maturity curve and observed credit spreads from market makers and broker dealers 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
hybrid securities these instruments are convertible securities measured at fair value based on observed trading activity and daily quotes 
in addition  on a daily basis  dealer quotes are marked against the current price of the corresponding underlying stock 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
for certain securities  the underlying security price may be adjusted to account for observable changes in the conversion and investment value from the time the quote was obtained 
such securities are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
equity securities the fair value of these securities is generally estimated using observable market data in active markets or bid prices from market makers and broker dealers 
generally  these securities are categorized in level i or ii of the fair value hierarchy as observable market data are readily available 
a small number of our equity securities  however  are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of market based transaction data or the use of model based evaluations 
other investments these securities are categorized in level ii or level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
derivative instruments and vie liabilities fair value is defined as the price that would be received in connection with the sale of an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability 
in determining an exit market  we consider the fact that most of our derivative 
table of contents contracts are unconditional and irrevocable  and contractually prohibit us from transferring them to other capital market participants 
accordingly  there is no principal market for such highly structured insured credit derivatives 
in the absence of a principal market  we value these insured credit derivatives in a hypothetical market where market participants include other monoline mortgage and financial guaranty insurers with similar credit quality to us  as if the risk of loss on these contracts could be transferred to these other mortgage and financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance companies 
we believe that in the absence of a principal market  this hypothetical market provides the most relevant information with respect to fair value estimates 
we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using internally generated models 
we utilize market observable inputs  such as credit spreads on similar products  whenever they are available 
when one of our transactions develops characteristics that are inconsistent with the characteristics of transactions that underlie the relevant market based index that we use in our credit spread valuation approach  and we can develop cash flow projections that we believe would represent the view of a typical market participant  we believe it is necessary to change to a discounted cash flow model from a credit spread valuation model 
this change in approach is generally prompted when the credit component  and not market factors  becomes the dominant driver of the estimated fair value for a particular transaction 
when the particular circumstances of a specific transaction  rather than systemic market risk or other market factors  becomes the dominant driver of fair value  the credit spread valuation approach will generally result in a fair value that is different than the discounted cash flow valuation and  we believe  less representative of a typical market participant s view 
therefore  in these instances  we believe the discounted cash flow valuation approach  and not the credit spread valuation approach  provides a fair value that better represents a typical market participant s view  as it results in a reasonable estimation of the credit component of fair value at a point in time where the index is no longer representative of the fair value of the particular transaction 
there is a high degree of uncertainty about our fair value estimates since our contracts are not traded or exchanged  which makes external validation and corroboration of our estimates difficult  particularly given the current market environment  where very few  if any  contracts are being traded or originated 
in very limited recent instances  we have negotiated terminations of financial guaranty contracts with our counterparties and believe that such terminations provide the most relevant data with respect to validating our fair value estimates and such data has been generally consistent with our fair value estimates 
beginning in  in accordance with a new accounting standard regarding fair value measurements  we made an adjustment to our derivative liabilities valuation methodology to account for our own non performance risk by incorporating our observable cds spread into the determination of the fair value of our derivative liabilities 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates may not be indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
put options on cps and consolidated cps vie debt the fair value of our put options on cps and the cps vie debt  in the absence of observable market data  is estimated based on the present value of the spread differential between the current market rate of issuing a perpetual preferred security and the maximum contractual rate of our perpetual preferred security as specified in our put option agreements 
in determining the current market rate  consideration is given to any relevant market observations  if available 
at december   given our recently completed tender offer for a portion of the cps securities  we believe the executed tender offer price provides the best indication of fair value 
as a result  we recorded a million reduction in the fair value of the put options on cps securities to million at the time of the tender offer 
in addition  related to the tender and purchase of the majority of the securities of two of the three trusts  we consolidated the assets and liabilities of those two trusts 
after consolidation  we have a remaining fair value of million related to the put options on cps included in derivative assets for the one trust that is not consolidated and million of vie debt related to the consolidated trusts 
the put options on cps and the cps consolidated vie debt are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets and nims vie debt nims credit derivatives are financial guarantees that we have issued on nims 
nims derivative assets primarily represent derivative assets in the nims trusts that we are required to consolidate 
the estimated fair value amounts of these financial instruments are derived from internally generated discounted cash flow models 
we estimate losses in each securitization underlying either the nims credit derivatives or the nims derivative assets by applying expected default rates separately to loans that are delinquent and those that are paying currently 
these default rates are based on historical experience of similar transactions 
we then project prepayment speeds on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and prepayment speeds are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization and nims bond  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each nims bond 
in addition to expected credit losses  we consider the future expected premiums to be received from the nims trust for each credit derivative 
the projected net losses are then discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  and based on our current cds spread  results in a significant reduction of the derivative liability 
because nims guarantees are not market traded instruments  considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair values 
the nims credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
as a result of our having to consolidate our nims structures  the derivative assets held by the nims vie are also fair valued using the same internally generated valuation model 
the nims vie derivative assets are also categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
changes in expected principal credit losses on nims could have a significant impact on our fair value estimate 
the gross expected principal credit losses were million as of december   which is our best estimate of settlement value at that date and represents of our total risk in force of million 
the recorded fair value of our total net liabilities related to nims as of december  was million  of which million relates to derivative assets and million relates to debt of the nims vie trusts  all of which are consolidated 
our fair value estimate incorporates a discount rate that is based on our cds spread  which has resulted in a fair value amount that is substantially less than the expected settlement value 
changes in the credit loss estimates will impact the fair value directly  reduced only by the present value factor  which is dependent on the timing of the expected losses and our credit spread 
corporate cdos the fair value of each of our corporate cdo transactions is estimated based on the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums we charge and the fair premium amount that we estimate that another financial guarantor would require to assume the rights and obligations under our contracts 
the fair value estimates reflect the fair value of the asset or liability  which is consistent with the in exchange approach  in which fair value is determined based on the price that would be received or paid in a current transaction as defined by the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
present value of expected future contractual premiums our contractual premiums are subject to change for two reasons all of our contracts provide our counterparties with the right to terminate upon our default and of our corporate cdo transactions as of december  provide our counterparties with the right to terminate these transactions based on certain rating agency downgrades that occurred during in determining the expected future premiums of these transactions  we adjust the contractual premiums for such transactions to reflect the estimated fair value of those premiums  based on our estimate of the probability of our counterparties exercising this downgrade termination right and the impact it would have on the remaining expected lifetime premium 
in these circumstances  we also cap the total estimated fair value of the contracts at zero  such that none of the contracts subject to immediate termination are in a derivative asset position 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of expected future premiums is our cds spread plus a risk free rate 
this discount rate reflects the risk that we may not collect future premiums due to our inability to satisfy our contractual obligations  which provides our counterparties the right to terminate the contracts 

table of contents for each corporate cdo transaction  we perform three principal steps in determining the fair premium amount first  we define a tranche on the cdx index defined below that equates to the risk profile of our specific transaction we refer to this tranche as an equivalent risk tranche  second  we determine the fair premium amount on the equivalent risk tranche for those market participants engaged in trading on the cdx index we refer to each of these participants as a typical market participant  and third  we adjust the fair premium amount for a typical market participant to account for the difference between the non performance or default risk of a typical market participant and the non performance or default risk of a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us in each case  we refer to the risk of non performance as non performance risk 
defining the equivalent risk tranche direct observations of fair premium amounts for our transactions are not available since these transactions cannot be traded or transferred pursuant to their terms and there is currently no active market for these transactions 
however  cds on tranches of a standardized index the cdx index are widely traded and observable  and provide relevant market data for determining the fair premium amount of our transactions  as described more fully below 
the cdx index is a synthetic corporate cdo that comprises a list of corporate obligors and is segmented into multiple tranches of synthetic senior unsecured debt of these obligors ranging from the equity tranche ie  the most credit risk or first loss position to the most senior tranche ie  the least credit risk 
we refer to each of these tranches as a standard cdx tranche 
a tranche is defined by an attachment point and detachment point  representing the range of portfolio losses for which the protection seller would be required to make a payment 
our corporate cdo transactions possess similar structural features to the standard cdx tranches  but often differ with respect to the referenced corporate entities  the term  the attachment point and the detachment points 
therefore  in order to determine the equivalent risk tranche for each of our corporate cdo transactions  we determine the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index that have comparable estimated probabilities of loss as the attachment and detachment points in our transactions 
we begin by performing a simulation analysis of referenced entity defaults in our transactions to determine the probability of portfolio losses exceeding our attachment and detachment points 
the referenced entity defaults are primarily determined based on the following inputs the market observed cds credit spreads of the referenced corporate entities  the correlations between each of the referenced corporate entities  and the term of the transaction 
for each referenced corporate entity in our corporate cdo transactions  the cds spreads associated with the term of our transactions credit curve define the estimated expected loss for each entity as applied in a market standard approach known as risk neutral modeling 
the credit curves on individual referenced entities are generally observable 
the expected cumulative loss for the portfolio of referenced entities associated with each of our transactions is the sum of the expected losses of these individual referenced entities 
with respect to the correlation of losses across the underlying reference entities  two obligors belonging to the same industry or located in the same geographical region are assumed to have a higher probability of defaulting together ie  they are more correlated 
an increase in the correlations between the referenced entities generally causes a higher expected loss for the portfolio associated with our transactions 
the estimated correlation factors that we use are derived internally based on observable third party inputs that are based on historical data 
the impact of our correlation assumptions currently does not have a material effect on our fair premium estimates in light of the significant impact of our non performance risk adjustment as described below 
once we have established the probability of portfolio losses exceeding the attachment and detachment points in our transactions  we then use the same simulation method to locate the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index with comparable probabilities 
these equivalent attachment and detachment points define the equivalent risk tranche on the cdx index that we use to determine fair premium amounts 

table of contents determining the typical fair premium amount the equivalent risk tranches for our corporate cdo transactions often are not identical to any standard cdx tranches 
as a result  fair premium amounts generally are not directly observable from the cdx index for the equivalent risk tranche and must be separately determined 
we make this determination through an interpolation in which we use the observed premium rates on the standard cdx tranches that most closely match our equivalent risk tranche to derive the typical fair premium amount for the equivalent risk tranche 
non performance risk adjustment on corporate cdos the typical fair premium amount estimated for the equivalent risk tranche represents the fair premium amount for a typical market participant not radian 
accordingly  the final step in our fair value estimation is to convert this typical fair premium amount into a fair premium amount for a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us 
a typical market participant is contractually bound by a requirement that collateral be posted regularly to minimize the impact of that participant s default or non performance 
this collateral posting feature makes these transactions less risky to the protection buyer  and therefore  priced differently 
none of our contracts require us to post collateral with our counterparties  which exposes our counterparties fully to our non performance risk 
we make an adjustment to the typical fair premium amount to account for both this contractual difference  as well as for the market s perception of our default probability which is observable through our credit default swap spread 
the amount of the non performance risk adjustment is computed based  in part  on the expected claim payment by radian 
to estimate this expected payment  we first determine the expected claim payment of a typical market participant by using a risk neutral modeling approach 
a significant underlying assumption of the risk neutral model approach that we use is that the typical fair premium amount is equal to the present value of expected claim payments from a typical market participant 
expected claim payments on a transaction are based on the expected loss on that transaction also determined using the risk neutral modeling approach 
radian s expected claim payment is calculated based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability 
the default probability of radian is determined from the observed radian group cds spread  and the default probability of the transaction is determined as described above under defining the equivalent risk tranche 
the present value of radian s expected claim payments is discounted using a risk free interest rate  as the expected claim payments have already been risk adjusted 
the reduction in our fair premium amount related to our non performance risk is limited to a minimum fair premium amount  which is determined based on our estimate of the minimum fair premium that a market participant would require to assume the risks of our obligations 
our non performance risk adjustment currently results in a material reduction of our typical fair premium amounts 
non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions our non corporate cdo transactions include our guaranty of rmbs cdos  cmbs cdos  trups cdos and cdos backed by other asset classes such as i municipal securities  ii synthetic financial guarantees of abs such as credit card securities  and iii project finance transactions 
the fair value of our non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions is calculated as the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums and our estimate of the fair premium amount for these transactions 
the present value of expected future contractual premiums is determined based on the methodology described above for corporate cdos 
for our credit card transactions  the fair premium amount is estimated using observed spreads on recent trades of securities that are similar to the securities that we guaranty 
in all other instances  we utilize internal models to estimate the fair premium amount as described below 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
rmbs cdos the fair value amounts for our two remaining rmbs cdo transactions are derived using standard market indices and discounted cash flows  to the extent expected losses are estimable 
the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligations in one of these transactions is reasonably similar to that which is included in the aaa rated abx 
he index  a standardized list of rmbs reference obligations 
accordingly  the 
table of contents fair premium amount for a typical market participant for this transaction is derived directly from the observed spreads of this index 
for our second rmbs cdo transaction  the underlying referenced obligations in this transaction have experienced significant credit deterioration  and we expect this deterioration ultimately will result in claims 
fair value for this transaction is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate projected claims based on our internal credit analysis which is based on the current performance of each underlying reference obligation  and our estimate of the claim rate associated with the current delinquent loans 
the expected cash flows from the underlying reference obligations are then present valued using a discount rate derived from the bbb abx 
he index 
the insured cash flows are present valued using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
cmbs cdos the fair premium amounts for our cmbs cdo transactions for a typical market participant are derived directly from the observed spreads on the cmbx indices 
the cmbx indices represent standardized lists of cmbs reference obligations 
a different cmbx index exists for different types of underlying referenced obligations based on their various origination periods and credit grades 
for each of our cmbs cdo transactions  we use the cmbx index that most directly correlates to our transaction with respect to the origination period and credit rating of the referenced obligations included in our transactions 
the typical fair premium amount is the expected future fair premiums determined by the observed index spreads present valued using a discount rate equal to the cds spread of a typical market participant plus a risk free rate 
trups cdos our trups transactions are cds on cdos where the collateral consists primarily of deeply subordinated securities issued by banks and insurance companies  as well as real estate investment trusts and other financial institutions  whose individual spreads are not observable 
in each case  we provide credit protection on a specific tranche of each cdo 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began to use a discounted cash flow valuation approach to determine fair value for these transactions 
as a result of significant credit deterioration during this reporting period  we determined that the market spreads utilized in prior periods were no longer a relevant key assumption in determining fair value of these transactions 
we utilize a discounted cash flow valuation approach that captures the credit characteristics of each transaction 
we estimate projected claims based on our internal credit analysis which is based on the current performance of each underlying reference obligation 
the expected cash flows to the trups transaction are then present valued using a discount rate derived from the observed market pricing for a trups transaction with similar characteristics 
the insured cash flows are present valued using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
for certain of our trups transactions  our counterparties may require that we pay them the outstanding par on the underlying trups bond if an event of default remains outstanding as of the cds termination date the conditional liquidity claim 
for these transactions  an additional fair value adjustment is made 
to calculate this adjustment  a probability that we will be required to pay a conditional liquidity claim is assigned based on our internal cash flow projections  which provides us with information as to the likelihood of the existence of a default at the time of maturity 
a discounted cash flow valuation is also performed for this scenario where we are required to make a conditional liquidity claim 
the fair value is set equal to the probability weighted average of the valuations from the two scenarios one in which our counterparty makes a conditional liquidity claim and one in which the claim is not made 
prior to the third quarter of  we used internally generated models to calculate the fair premium amount for a typical market participant based on the following inputs our contractual premium rate which was estimated to be equal to the typical fair premium rate as of the contract date  the estimated change in the spread of the underlying referenced obligations  the remaining term of the trups cdos and the deterioration if any of the subordination 
all other non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions for all of our other non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions  observed prices and market indices are not available 
as a result  we utilize an internal model that estimates fair premium 
the fair premium amount is calculated such that the expected profit fair premium amount net of expected losses and other expenses is proportional to an internally 
table of contents developed risk based capital amount 
expected losses and our internally developed risk based capital amounts are projected by our model using the internal credit rating  term  and current par outstanding for each transaction 
for each of the non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions discussed above  with the exception of cdos of abs transactions and the trups transactions that are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  we make an adjustment to the fair premium amounts as described above under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the non performance risk adjustment associated with our cdos of abs and our trups transactions is incorporated in the fair value as described above  therefore  no separate adjustment is required 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
assumed financial guaranty credit derivatives in making our determination of fair value for these credit derivatives  we use information provided to us by our counterparties to these reinsurance transactions  which are the primary insurers the primaries of the underlying credits  including the primaries fair valuations for these credits 
the information obtained from our counterparties is not received with sufficient time for us to properly record the mark to market liability as of the balance sheet date 
therefore  the amount recorded as of december  is based on the most recent available financial information 
the lag in reporting is consistent from period to period 
the fair value is based on credit spreads obtained by primaries from market data sources published by third parties eg dealer spread tables for collateral similar to assets within the transactions being valued as well as collateral specific spreads provided by trustees or obtained from market sources if such data is available 
if observable market spreads are not available or reliable for the underlying reference obligations  then the primaries valuations are predominantly based on market indices that most closely resemble the underlying reference obligations  considering asset class  credit quality rating and maturity of the underlying reference obligations 
in addition  these valuations incorporate an adjustment for our non performance risk that is based on our cds spread 
the primaries models used to estimate the fair value of these instruments include a number of factors  including credit spreads  changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of referenced entities 
in establishing our fair value for these transactions  we assess the reasonableness of the primaries valuations by reviewing the primaries publicly available information regarding their mark to market processes  including methodology and key assumptions  and analyzing and discussing the changes in fair value with the primaries where the changes appear unusual or do not appear materially consistent with credit loss related information when provided by the primaries for these transactions 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
mortgage insurance domestic and international cds in the second quarter of  we paid an aggregate of million to terminate all of our remaining domestic mortgage insurance cds transactions 
the settlement payments were approximately equal to the fair value of these terminated transactions 
as a result  we no longer have any exposure to domestic mortgage insurance cds 
prior to their termination  the estimated fair value of our mortgage insurance domestic cds was determined using internal models that employed a discounted cash flow methodology 
we estimated losses in each securitization by applying expected default rates separately to loans that were delinquent and to those that were current 
we then projected prepayment speeds on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and prepayment speeds were used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each mortgage insurance domestic cds 
in addition to expected credit losses  the fair value for each mortgage insurance domestic cds was approximated by incorporating future expected premiums to be received from the transaction 
these future expected premiums were discounted utilizing a risk adjusted interest rate that was based on the current rating of each transaction 
the projected net losses were discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  which resulted in a significant reduction of the derivative liability 
prior to their termination  our mortgage insurance domestic cds were categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we paid million to terminate one of our remaining two international cds transactions 
in determining the estimated fair value of our mortgage insurance international cds  we use the following information non binding fair value quotes from our counterparties on each respective deal  which are based on quotes for transactions with similar underlying collateral from market makers and other broker dealers  and in the absence of observable market data for these transactions  a review of monthly information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral and discussion with our counterparties regarding any unusual or inconsistent changes in fair value 
in either case  in the event there are material inconsistencies in the inputs to determine estimated fair value  they are reviewed and a final determination is made by management in light of the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each price 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
for the remaining mortgage insurance international cds transaction  we make an adjustment to the fair value amount described above to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the amount of the adjustment is computed based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability as described more fully under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos 
our one remaining international cds transaction is categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
investments we group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three main categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of income 
beginning in the second quarter of  we classified all fixed income securities as trading securities 
short term investments consist of assets invested in class one money market instruments  certificates of deposit and highly liquid  interest bearing instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
amortization of premium and accretion of discount are calculated principally using the interest method over the term of the investment 
realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method 
see note for further discussion on the fair value of investments 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments i permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  ii clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  iii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iv clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and v amends the accounting standard regarding accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities to eliminate the exemption from applying the requirements of the accounting standard regarding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on a qspe from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
in addition  we elected to record these convertible securities at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as net gains or losses on other financial instruments 
on april   we adopted a new accounting standard regarding recognition and presentation of otti 
in accordance with this new standard  if an entity intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  the security is other than temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations 
otherwise  losses on securities which are other than temporarily impaired are separated into i the portion of loss which represents the credit loss  and ii the portion which is due to other factors 
the credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations while the loss due to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
a credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of discounted cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than the cost basis of the security 
the present value of discounted cash flows is determined using the original yield of the security 
for 
table of contents securities held as of april  that had previously been other than temporarily impaired  an after tax transition adjustment of million was booked to reclassify the non credit loss portion of these impairments from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors  including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline in value eg  credit event  interest related or market fluctuations  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer  including the current and future impact of any specific events  our intent to sell the security  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell it before recovery  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
a debt security impairment is deemed other than temporary if we either intend to sell the security  or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before expected recovery of amortized cost  or we expect to be unable to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
vies we consolidate vies for which we determine that we are the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  a number of factors are considered  including the structure of the entity and the risks it was created to pass along to variable interest holders  the extent of credit risk absorbed by us and the extent to which credit protection provided by other variable interest holders reduces this exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
amortization of these costs for each underwriting year book of business is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit including persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year used as a basis for amortization are evaluated regularly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to our consolidated statements of operations if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these estimates and the assumptions on which they are based 
the use of different assumptions would have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
when a pdr is established  all related deferred policy acquisition costs are written off 
as a result of the establishment of a first lien pdr in the second quarter of  all deferred policy acquisition costs on first lien domestic mortgage insurance written prior to june   were written off during that period 
deferred policy acquisition costs in the financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are principally related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  
table of contents premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment  and different assumptions could produce different results 
as a result of the ambac commutation  we wrote off million of deferred policy acquisition costs in origination costs of derivative contracts are expensed as incurred 
income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the balance sheet method  which recognizes the future tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of these amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset dta when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our dta will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess our need for a valuation allowance and this assessment is based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such dta will be realized in future periods 
future realization of our dta will ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character ordinary income versus capital gains within the applicable carryforward period provided under the tax law

ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie is required  and the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie is eliminated 
the quantitative approach that was eliminated was based on determining which enterprise absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
sfas no 
requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both i the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform  on an annual basis  a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities and certain financial guaranty contracts 
this analysis is performed by determining the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
our sensitivity analysis is generally calculated as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we review changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices to determine whether there has been a material change in our market risk since that presented in connection with our annual sensitivity analysis 

table of contents interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk and we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the changes in fair value of our fixed income securities by projecting an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
the carrying value of our total investment portfolio at december  and december   was billion and billion  respectively  of which and  respectively  was invested in fixed income securities 
we calculate duration of our fixed income securities  expressed in years  in order to estimate interest rate sensitivity of these securities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the market value of our fixed income securities by million at december   while a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the market value of our fixed income securities by million at december  at december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years 
the market value and carrying value of our long term debt at december  was million and million  respectively 
in general  the market value of our long term debt reflects market concerns regarding our ability to continue to service our debt and ultimately repay or refinance our debt as it matures 
credit risk we provide credit protection in the form of cds and other financial guaranty contracts that are marked to market through earnings 
with the exception of nims  these financial guaranty derivative contracts generally insure obligations with considerable subordination beneath our exposure at the time of issuance 
the underlying asset classes of these obligations include corporate  abs  rmbs  cmbs  and trups 
with the exception of nims  one cdo of abs and our insured trups cdos all of which are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  the value of our financial guaranty derivative contracts are affected predominantly by changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations  in some cases compounded by ratings downgrades of these insured obligations 
as credit spreads and ratings change  the value of these financial guaranty derivative contracts will change and the resulting gains and losses will be recorded in our operating results 
in addition  with the adoption of the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements  we have incorporated the market s perception of our non performance risk into the market value of our derivative instruments 
we have determined that the fair value of our cds and other financial guaranty contracts is materially exposed to changes in credit spreads 
sensitivity to changes in credit spreads can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous shift in credit spread curves 
the following table presents the pre tax change in the fair value of our insured derivatives portfolio and nims vie debt as a result of instantaneous shifts in credit spreads as of december   assuming that our own cds spread remained constant 
these changes were calculated using the valuation methods described in critical accounting policies fair value of financial instruments above 
contracts for which the fair value is calculated using specific dealer quotes or actual transaction prices are excluded from the following table 
in millions weighted average spread market value net liabilities effect on market value based on widening of credit spreads tightening of credit spreads nims corporate cdos non corporate cdos estimated pre tax loss gain includes vie debt of million  and nims derivative assets of million 

table of contents if our cds spread was to tighten significantly  and other credit spreads utilized in our fair value methodologies remained constant  our unrealized losses on derivatives and nims vie debt could increase significantly 
the table below presents the pre tax change in fair value of our derivatives portfolio as a result of an instantaneous shift of our cds curve as of december  in isolation effect on market value based on in millions radian group spread market value net liabilities basis point widening of radian s spread basis point tightening of radian s spread nims corporate cdos non corporate cdos estimated pre tax gain loss includes nims vie debt of million  and nims derivative assets of million 
given the relatively high level of volatility in spreads for our derivative transactions and nims vie debt including our own cds spread during and  the sensitivities presented above are higher than our longer term historical experience  where spread volatilities rarely exceeded basis points before the range of  basis point tightening and  basis point widening was determined  to a significant degree  based on our most recent experience  which we believe is reasonably likely to continue in the current market environment despite historical levels that were much more stable 
foreign exchange rate risk one means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our currency exposure as of december  by identifying investments in our investment portfolio that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as part of our analysis  our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were remeasured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million as of december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in euros 
the value of the euro against the us dollar strengthened from at december  to at december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the yen against the us dollar weakened from at december  to at december  equity market price at december   the market value and cost of our equity securities were million and million  respectively 
included in the market value and cost of our equity securities is million and million  respectively  related to trading securities 
exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in equity investments by million as of december
