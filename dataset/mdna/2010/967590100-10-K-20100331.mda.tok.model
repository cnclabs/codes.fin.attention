overview widepoint corporation widepoint or the company is a technology based provider of product and services to both the government sector and commercial markets 
widepoint was incorporated in delaware on may  we have grown through the merger with and acquisition of highly specialized regional it consulting companies 
our expertise lies in the following three business segments wireless mobility management solutions  cybersecurity solutions  and consulting services and products 
these business segments offer unique solutions in wireless mobility  cybersecurity and other associated it consulting services and products in which we provide specific subject matter expertise in it architecture and planning  software implementation services  it outsourcing  and forensic informatics 
for additional information related to our three business segments  see note to our financial statements in this form k 
widepoint has three material operational entities  isys  which we acquired in january  orc  which we acquired in november   and widepoint il  inc 
we also operate protexx acquisition corp as protexx  which we acquired in july  and which is still in the developmental stage 
isys specializes in wireless mobility solutions  forensic informatics  and ia services  predominantly to various agencies and departments of the us government 
orc specializes in cybersecurity solutions with a focus in it integration and secure authentication processes and software  and providing services to the us government 
orc has been at the forefront of implementing public key infrastructure pki technologies 
pki technology uses a class of algorithms in which a user can receive two electronic keys  consisting of a public key and a private key  to encrypt any information and or communication being transmitted to or from the user within a computer network and between different computer networks 
pki technology is rapidly becoming the technology of choice to enable security services within and between different computer systems utilized by various agencies and departments of the us government 
widepoint  il specializes in it consulting services predominately in the chicagoland area and cross sells various services of our other operating subsidiaries 
protexx  which is a development stage company  specializes in identity assurance  and mobile and wireless data protection products and services 
we intend to continue to market and sell our technical capabilities into the governmental and commercial marketplace 
further  we are continuing to actively search out new synergistic acquisitions that we believe may further enhance our present base of business and service offerings 
this effort has already been augmented by our acquisitions of orc and isys  our asset purchase of protexx  and our internal growth initiatives 
with the addition of the customer base and the increase in revenues attributable to our isys acquisition  widepoint s opportunity to leverage and expand further into the federal marketplace has improved substantially 
isys s past client successes  top security clearances for their personnel  and additional breadth of management talent have expanded the company s reach into markets that previously were not fully accessible to widepoint 
the company intends to continue to leverage the synergies between itself and isys  and cross sell its technical capabilities into each separate marketplace serviced by our respective subsidiaries 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  due to revenues earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of the pass through of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts  the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of our acquisitions  which predominantly operate in the us federal marketplace  we rely upon a larger portion of our revenues from the federal government directly or as a subcontractor 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
such suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenues in the fourth calendar quarter ie  the first quarter of the government s fiscal year 
further  a change in senior government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases the services that we offer 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
these comparisons are not indicators of future performance and no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a possible material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  most of widepoint s current costs consist primarily of the salaries and benefits paid to widepoint s technical  marketing and administrative personnel as well as vendor related costs in connection with our mobile telecom managed services 
as a result of our plan to expand widepoint s operations through a combination of internal growth initiatives and merger and acquisition opportunities  widepoint expects such costs to increase 
widepoint s profitability also depends upon both the volume of services performed and the company s ability to manage costs 
as a significant portion of the company s cost is labor related  widepoint must effectively manage these costs to achieve and grow its profitability 
the company must also manage our airtime plans and other vendor related offerings under our mobile telecom managed services provided to our customers as they also represent a significant portion of our costs 
to date  the company has attempted to maximize its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of its proprietary methodologies  and by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in consultant fees received from its clients 
the uncertainties relating to the ability to achieve and maintain profitability  obtain additional funding to partially fund the company s growth strategy and provide the necessary investment to continue to upgrade its management reporting systems to meet the continuing demands of the present regulatory changes affect the comparability of the information reflected in the financial information presented above 
our staff consists of business process and computer specialists who help our government and civilian customers augment and expand their resident technologic skills and competencies  drive technical innovation  and help develop and maintain a competitive edge in today s rapidly changing technological environment in business 
our organization emphasizes an intense commitment to our people  our customers  and the quality of our solutions offerings 
as a services organization  our customers are our primary focus 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
widepoint believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonably based upon information available to it at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  the company s financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that widepoint believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  goodwill value  intangible assets value  and accounting for income taxes 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenue from the sale of pki credentials is recognized when delivery occurs 
arrangements with customers on pki related contracts may involve multiple deliverable elements 
in these cases  the company applies the principles prescribed in asc  multiple element arrangements 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of the nature of the contract or product sold  the terms of each specific transaction  the relative fair values of the elements required by asc  any contingencies that may be present  its historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer  and other current market and economic conditions 
our revenues are derived primarily from services provided by our employees and the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price or time and materials contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts revenues for cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to customer acceptance  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval in accordance with the guidance of customer specific acceptance provisions outlined in sec topic  revenue recognition  par 
b 
time and materials for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
other long term contracts revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
allowance for doubtful accounts widepoint determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligations  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based on these factors and provide allowances for these receivables when collections become doubtful 
provisions are made based on specific review of all significant outstanding balances 
as of december  there was a reserve of approximately  made after the company reviewed and determined that a specific receivable was doubtful as to it collectability 
predominately and because of the company s history of minimal credit losses and the nature of the company s customers the company does not make general reserves for bad debts but does make specific allowances in certain cases 
as no specific accounts were in doubt at december   no allowance for doubtful accounts was believed necessary at that time 
goodwill goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets acquired 
authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations indicates that goodwill is not subject to amortization and annual review is required for impairment 
the impairment test under current guidance is based on a two step process involving i comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value and ii comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the impairment tests were applied to the two reporting units having goodwill  orc and isys 
the allocation of goodwill to those two units is based upon the original purchase price allocations when those subsidiaries were acquired 
the company s annual impairment testing date is december goodwill is a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represents approximately of our total assets as of december  goodwill is identified on the face of the balance sheet 
intangibles purchase accounting intangibles the company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 
the intangibles recognized in the acquisition are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
internally developed intangibles the company recognizes an internally developed software whenever the costs of the internally generated software are beyond the research and development stage and is provable for which the costs of such efforts are specifically identifiable  has a determinate life  and is not inherent in a continuing business and is not related to a reporting entity as a whole 
the software development costs recognized as internally developed are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from the expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company reviews its long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
as of december   the company is not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or the assumptions the company has used to value long lived assets 
long lived assets are a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represent approximately of our total assets 
any impairment as a result of the estimate utilizing undiscounted net cash flows to determine the assumed value of long lived assets could have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets are identified on the face of the balance sheet as intangibles 
amortization of intangibles is identified on the face of the statement of operations within cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes widepoint accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts  and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has incurred historical net operating losses  or nols  for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  no federal income tax provision has been recorded to date and there are no taxes payable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of historical losses that may limit utilization of nol carry forwards in future periods  management is unable to predict whether these net deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to expiration 
the unused nol carry forwards expire in years through as such  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
widepoint believes that its estimates are reasonable  given the lack of historical earnings and the fact that there may be significant limitations placed on the use of the nol carryforwards 
there is  however  a significant possibility that the company will have sufficient income in the future to utilize substantial portions of the deferred tax assets 
no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is described above 
such a change in the estimate reflected in the historical income tax provisions could have a material effect on the income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
the company has performed a section analysis and we have determined preliminarily that approximately million of the company s net operating losses may be limited as a result of expirations that may occur prior to the utilization of those net operating losses under the limitations from certain changes of control that have occurred 
the result of the potential limitations was not significant to the results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  accounting standards updates revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit as these products or services often are provided at different points in time or over different time periods 
this guidance establishes how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting and expands the disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangement 
the guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have any significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
fasb codification on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc became the single authoritative source for nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the asc supersedes all previous authoritative gaap applicable to the company and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after september  business combinations and identification of reporting units on january   the company adopted authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations 
the guidance establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including non controlling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingent liabilities 
the guidance also requires acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
any changes in the company s valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets attributable to prior business combinations will generally be reflected in income tax expense in the period in which the change occurs 
at december   there was no deferred tax asset valuation allowance that was attributable to prior business combinations 
additionally  the newly adopted authoritative guidance changes the definition of a business which can have impacts on the identification of reporting units used to measure goodwill for impairment 
the company has assessed this impact and has determined there are no material impacts to the identified reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and the related impairment testing of such goodwill 
goodwill is more fully described in note to the financial statements 
fair value measurements on september  fasb issued guidance that defines fair value  establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value in that is intended to result in increased consistency and comparability in fair value measurements 
the guidance was originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted 
in early  the fasb delayed by one year the effective date of the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the company elected to adopt this deferral 
on january   the company adopted the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that was deferred 
with the expiration of the deferral  the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements now apply for the first time impact the company in the following areas goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing which involves the fair value measurement of reporting units  assets  and or liabilities nonfinancial long lived assets such as pp e measured at fair value for impairment assessment subsequent events subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the company recognizes in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet  including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the financial statements 
the company s financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after the balance sheet date and before financial statements are issued 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was materially attributable to growth in our wireless mobility management and cybersecurity solutions segments  offset by a slight reduction in revenues in our consulting services segment 
this revenue growth in the wireless mobility management and cybersecurity solutions segments was attributable to expansions in their respective current customer base along with the addition of new customers in our wireless mobility management segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this growth occurred primarily as a result of continuing adoption and expansion of the company s services within the us federal government agencies it presently represents  augmented by the addition of several additional agencies that awarded the company contracts in in the long term we anticipate our wireless mobility management segment should continue to expand as we witness further adoption by the us federal agencies and departments  and as we reach out and continue to expand our marketing to state and local municipalities and large commercial enterprises 
our cybersecurity solutions segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december   to approximately million for the year ended december  this growth occurred primarily as a result of the continued adoption and expansion of several programs supported by various us federal government agencies 
in the long term we anticipate that our cybersecurity solutions segment should continue to grow as various us federal government agencies continue to sponsor and expand programs that strengthen their ability to monitor and maintain identity management solutions and as commercial enterprises adopt similar goals 
our consulting services segment experienced decreased revenues of approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease in revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a reduction in revenues associated with our software reselling activities within this segment during the fourth quarter of cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december   was approximately million  or of revenues  an increase of approximately million above cost of sales of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  cost of sales as a percentage decreased approximately from of revenues for the year ended december  to of revenues for the year ended december  the percentage decrease was materially due to a greater mix of higher margin services sold in our fiscal year as compared to our fiscal year the increased mix was related to the growth in our wireless mobility management and cybersecurity solutions segments as they related to our overall product mix in the two fiscal periods 
the absolute dollar increase in cost of sales was substantially attributable to higher revenues  combined with isys service offering that includes an option that provides for the payments of carrier charges on behalf of some of the customer base 
these charges are embedded into the service fees associated with the cost of providing some of our mobile telecom offerings to certain customers 
we do not separately measure our profit margins for contracts with this feature 
depreciation and amortization applied to cost of sales also increased approximately  from  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was substantially a result of the addition of internally generated software amortization expense in support of our cybersecurity solutions segment 
we believe that as our percentage of business from our higher margin services expands in relationship to our lower margin services that our overall cost of sales as a percentage may decrease in the future 
the cost elements related to consultant salaries  benefits and expenses at all of our subsidiaries are substantially similar 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of revenues  an increase of million as compared to gross profit of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  gross profit expanded as a result of a percentage decrease in cost of sales related to a greater mix of higher margin services offered by the company s wireless mobility management and cybersecurity solutions segments in relationship to the company s overall revenue mix 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenditures for new personnel and tools as we increased our efforts to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure as part of our strategy to further increase our presence into the federal marketplace  which was partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing personnel within our commercial marketplace 
as we expand our sales and marketing efforts these costs may increase 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was attributable to increasing general and administrative infrastructure costs associated with operating a larger business while the percentage decrease was primarily attributable to greater revenues that more than offset the absolute dollar increase in our general and administrative expenses 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense  net of depreciation in cost of sales  for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  an increase of approximately  as compared to approximately  of such expenses  or less than of revenues  recorded by the company for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the increased pool of depreciable assets 
interest income expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in was primarily attributable to lower interest rates payable on savings accounts in comparison to interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  as compared to  of interest expense for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in was primarily attributable to lesser expenses associated with the debt instruments issued by the company in connection with the acquisition of isys 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  in income taxes for the year ended december  the company incurred a deferred income tax expense of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax liability attributable to the differences in our treatment of the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes versus book purposes as it relates to our acquisition of isys in january because the goodwill is not amortized for book purposes but is amortized for tax purposes and goodwill is considered a permanent asset and not a temporary asset  the related deferred tax liability cannot be reversed until some indeterminate future period when the goodwill becomes impaired  and or is disposed of 
the deferred tax liability can be offset by future taxable earnings and the deferred tax expense is a non cash expense 
asc topic requires the expected timing of future reversals of deferred tax liabilities to be taken into account when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets 
therefore  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the goodwill is not to be considered a source of future taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
because the company has a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred income tax asset  the deferred income liability associated with the tax deductible goodwill has been recorded and not offset against existing deferred income tax assets 
net income loss 
as a result of the above  the net income for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to the net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected segment and consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated 
segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
management does not analyze assets for decision making purposes as it relates to the segments below 
accordingly  information is not available for long lived assets or total assets 
wireless cyber consulting corp consol revenue operating income including amortization and depreciation expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net pretax income income tax expense net earnings wireless cyber consulting corp consol revenue operating income loss including amortization and depreciation expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net pretax income income tax expense net loss liquidity and capital the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
during and  operations were primarily financed with working capital  senior debt  issuance of common stock  and stock option and warrant exercises 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily a result of higher accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset somewhat by a decrease in deferred revenue as a result of the performance of a prepayment on work contracted and paid by a customer in accounts payable increased solely due to the timing of payments being pushed to january the cash portion of the earnout of approximately  is included in the accrued expenses at december  the decrease in cash used in investing and financing activities were primarily due to the payoff of a sellers note for the purchase of isys  associated payments to the former owner of isys  pursuant to earnout provisions in connection with the company s purchase of isys and the attainment by such former owner of the required performance thresholds  and for the additional purchase of equipment 
capital expenditures in property and equipment were approximately  excluding any capital leases for the year ended december   as compared to capital expenditures in property and equipment of approximately  excluding capital leases for the year ended december  substantially all of the increases in assets and liabilities in the company s balance sheet were attributable to the company s greater revenues and profitability in  which increased current assets and liabilities 
this was augmented by increases in goodwill as the result of the realization of the earnout by isys  llc in fiscal year  and further augmented by the continuing payoff of debt related to the company s term note in connection with the purchase of isys  llc in fiscal year the company requires substantial working capital to fund the future growth of its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  and capital expenditures 
there are currently no material commitments for capital expenditures but that could change with the addition of material contract awards 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
widepoint believes that its current cash position is sufficient to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements through however  constant growth and technological change in our market makes it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to increase revenue and income streams that will generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
the company must also continue to generate positive cash flows to support our debt service and the continued paydown of our outstanding term note 
additionally  a major expansion might require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 
as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million 
widepoint s primary source of liquidity consists of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable 
current liabilities include approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the company s business environment is characterized by rapid technological change  experiencing times of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change the company s performance and outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations  as increased costs to the company have generally been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could substantially differ from those estimates 
this report contains forward looking statements setting forth the company s beliefs or expectations relating to future revenues and profitability 
actual results may differ materially from projected or expected results due to changes in the demand for the company s products and services  uncertainties relating to the results of operations  dependence on its major customers  risks associated with rapid technological change and the emerging services market  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  and its dependence on key employees and other risks and uncertainties affecting the technology industry generally 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
