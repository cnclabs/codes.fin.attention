item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents there are factors outside of our control that may decrease the demand for our products and services  which may adversely affect our performance 
our success depends on the sustained demand for our products 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending on our products  including  among other things  general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  weather  fuel prices and consumer confidence in future economic conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
beginning in fiscal  economic conditions deteriorated significantly in the united states  and worldwide  and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
during periods of economic decline  when discretionary income is lower  consumers or potential consumers could delay  reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services  which reduces our sales 
in addition  during such periods  advertising revenue in our ag interactive businesses decline  as advertisers reduce their advertising budgets 
a prolonged economic downturn or slow economic recovery may also lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 
providing new and compelling products is critical to our future profitability and cash flow 
one of our key business strategies has been to gain profitable market share by providing relevant  compelling and a superior product offering 
as a result  the need to continuously update and refresh our product offerings is an ongoing  evolving process requiring expenditures and investments that will continue to impact net sales  earnings and cash flows over future periods 
at times  the amount and timing of such expenditures and investments depends on the success of a product offering as well as the schedules of our retail partners 
we cannot assure you that this strategy will either increase our revenue or profitability 
in addition  even if our strategy is successful  our profitability may be adversely affected if consumer demand for lower priced  value cards continues to expand  thereby eroding our average selling prices 
our strategy may also have flaws and may not be successful 
for example  we may not be able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly sell or overstock unpopular products and be forced to grant significant credits  accept significant returns or write off a significant amount of inventory  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
conversely  shortages of popular items could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a few of our customers are material to our business and operations 
net sales to our five largest customers  which include mass merchandisers and chain drug stores  accounted for approximately  and of total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
approximately of the north american social expression products segment s revenue in  and was attributable to its top five customers  and approximately of the international social expression products segment s revenue in  and was attributable to its top three customers 
net sales to wal mart stores  inc and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively  and net sales to target corporation accounted for approximately of total revenue in there can be no assurance that our large customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past 
the loss of sales to one of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
difficulties in integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the cost savings and increased revenues anticipated as a result of these acquisitions 
in calendar year  we acquired the greeting card company recycled paper greetings  inc now known as papyrus recycled greetings  inc  and the papyrus brand and associated wholesale division of schurman fine papers schurman  which supplies papyrus brand greeting cards primarily to leading specialty  mass  grocery and drug store channels 
in addition  we continue to regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates  acquire candidates on acceptable terms or integrate acquired businesses successfully 
future acquisitions could cause us to take on additional compliance obligations as well as experience dilution 
table of contents and incur debt  contingent liabilities  increased interest expense  restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
integrating our recent acquisitions  as well as future businesses that we may acquire  involves significant challenges 
in particular  the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration of these acquired businesses has and will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from our day to day operations 
the process of integrating operations may also cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel 
employee uncertainty and distraction during the integration process may also disrupt our business 
our strategy is  in part  predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services 
achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  we may not be able to realize the benefits of anticipated integration of sales forces  asset rationalization  systems integration  and more comprehensive product and service offerings 
if schurman fine papers is unable to operate its retail stores successfully  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
on april   we sold our retail operations segment  including all of our card and gift retail store assets  to schurman  which now operates stores under the american greetings  carlton cards and papyrus brands 
although we do not control schurman  because schurman is licensing the papyrus  american greetings and carlton cards names for its retail stores  actions taken by schurman may be seen by the public as actions taken by us  which  in turn  could adversely affect our reputation or brands 
in addition  the failure of schurman to operate its retail stores profitably could have a material adverse effect on us  our reputation and our brands  and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  because  under the terms of the transaction we remain subject to certain of the retail operations store leases on a contingent basis through our subleasing of stores to schurman as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report  as of february   schurman s aggregate commitments to us under these subleases was approximately million  we are the predominant supplier of greetings cards and other social expression products to the retail stores operated by schurman  and we have provided credit support to schurman  including up to million of guarantees in favor of the lenders under schurman s senior revolving credit facility as described in note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
as a result  if schurman is unable to operate its retail stores profitably  we may incur significant costs if schurman is unable to pay for product that it has purchased from us  schurman is unable to pay rent and other amounts due with respect to the retail store leases that we have subleased to it  or we become obligated under our guarantees of its indebtedness 
accordingly  we may decide in the future to provide schurman with additional financial or operational support to assist schurman successfully operate its stores 
providing such support  however  could result in it being determined that we have a controlling financial interest in schurman under the financial accounting standards board s standards pertaining to the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
for information regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item if it is determined that we have a controlling financial interest in schurman  we will be required to consolidate schurman s operations into our results  which could materially affect our reported results of operations and financial position as we would be required to include a portion of schurman s income or losses and assets and liabilities into our financial statements 

table of contents our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by retail consolidations 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to display space  scan based trading and other conditions 
increased consolidations in the retail industry could result in other changes that could damage our business  such as a loss of customers  decreases in volume  less favorable contractual terms and the growth of discount chains 
in addition  as the bargaining strength of our retail customers grows  we may be required to grant greater credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to these customers 
we may not be able to recover the costs of these incentives if the customer does not purchase a sufficient amount of products during the term of its agreement with us  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
bankruptcy of key customers could give rise to an inability to pay us and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts 
many of our largest customers are mass market retailers 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years 
in addition  the retail industry in general has experienced significant declines due to the worldwide downturn in the economy and decreasing consumer demand 
as a result  retailers have experienced liquidity problems and some have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
there is a risk that certain of our key customers will not pay us  or that payment may be delayed because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond our control  which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and may require us to write off deferred cost assets 
additionally  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if certain of these mass market retailers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy  or significantly reduce the number of stores they operate 
we rely on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets 
we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers and suppliers for various products we distribute to customers 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
we generally do not have long term supply contracts and some of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas 
in addition  a portion of our current operations are conducted and located abroad 
the success of our sales to  and operations in  foreign markets depends on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we sell our products 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political instability  civil unrest and labor shortages  imposition of new legislation and customs regulations relating to imports that may limit the quantity and or increase the cost of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a particular region  lack of effective product quality control procedures by foreign manufacturers and suppliers  currency and foreign exchange risks  and potential delays or disruptions in transportation as well as potential border delays or disruptions 
also  new regulatory initiatives may be implemented that have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include antidumping and countervailing duties or other trade related sanctions  which could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries 
additionally  as a large  multinational corporation  we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world  including antitrust and tax requirements  anti boycott regulations  import export customs 
table of contents regulations and other international trade regulations  the usa patriot act and the foreign corrupt practices act 
failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to criminal or monetary liabilities and other sanctions  which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating income and conversely  the weakening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact 
for the year ended february   foreign currency translation unfavorably affected revenues by million and favorably affected segment operating income by million compared to the year ended february  certain transactions  particularly in foreign locations  are denominated in other than that location s local currency 
changes in the exchange rates between the two currencies from the original transaction date to the settlement date will result in a currency transaction gain or loss that directly impacts our reported earnings 
for the year ended february   the impact of currency movements on these transactions favorably affected operating income by million 
the volatility of currency exchange rates may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the greeting card and gift wrap industries are extremely competitive  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
there are an estimated  greeting card publishers in the united states ranging from small  family run organizations to major corporations 
in general  however  the greeting card business is extremely concentrated 
we believe that we are one of only two main suppliers offering a full line of social expression products 
our main competitor  hallmark cards  inc  may have substantially greater financial  technical or marketing resources  a greater customer base  stronger name recognition and a lower cost of funds than we do 
this competitor may also have longstanding relationships with certain large customers to which it may offer products that we do not provide  putting us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result  this competitor as well as other competitors that may be smaller than us  may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of its products  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we are unable to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to our customers and ultimate consumers  or if we are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products to achieve widespread market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively  our sales may be adversely affected  we may be required to take certain financial charges  including goodwill impairments  and our results of operations and financial condition could otherwise be adversely affected 
we face intense competition from a range of competitors in the digital photography products and services industries and may be unsuccessful in competing against current and future competitors 
the digital photography products and services industries are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors improve their offerings and as new participants enter the market or as industry consolidation further develops 
competition may result in pricing pressures  reduced profit margins or our inability to gain market share  any of which could substantially harm our business and 
table of contents results of operations 
webshots and photoworks  our photo sharing and personal publishing businesses  face intense competition from a wide range of companies  including the following online digital photography services companies such as shutterfly  kodak easyshare gallery formerly known as ofoto  snapfish  which is a service of hewlett packard  vista print  and others  internet portals and search engines such as yahoo  aol and google that offer broad reaching digital photography and related products and services to their large user bases  social media companies that host images such as myspace  facebook and hi  and specialized companies in the photo book and stationery business such as hallmark  shutterfly  tiny prints  minted  picaboo and blurb 
many of our competitors have significantly longer operating histories  larger and broader customer bases  greater brand and name recognition and greater financial  research and development  and distribution resources 
some competitors are able to devote substantially more resources to website and systems development or to investments or partnerships with traditional and online competitors 
well funded competitors  particularly new entrants  may choose to prioritize growing their market share and brand awareness instead of profitability 
competitors and new entrants in the digital photography products and services industries may develop new products  technologies  or capabilities that could render obsolete or less competitive many of our products  services and content 
in addition  because many of these existing and future products  technologies and capabilities are protected by intellectual property laws  from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims against us 
we may incur significant costs to defend these claims and we may not be able to create successful or cost effective alternatives  or otherwise obtain rights to similar product  technologies or capability on a reasonable or timely basis 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures could harm our business and prospects 
we are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our borrowing arrangements  which could affect our flexibility to fund ongoing operations  uses of capital and strategic initiatives  and  if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants  could lead to significant challenges in meeting our liquidity requirements 
the terms of our borrowing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants  including customary operating restrictions that limit our ability to engage in such activities as borrowing and making investments  capital expenditures and distributions on our capital stock  and engaging in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
we are also subject to customary financial covenants  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
these covenants restrict the amount of our borrowings  reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives 
these borrowing arrangements are described in more detail in liquidity and capital resources under item and in note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
during fiscal we anticipate refinancing indebtedness under our senior credit facility  at which time  certain of these covenants may change and  in some instance  become more restrictive than those that are currently in place 
compliance with some of these covenants is based on financial measures derived from our operating results 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results  such as through reduced customer demand and inflation 
a decline in our business could make us unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  in which case we may be restricted in how we manage our business and deploy capital  including by limiting our ability to make acquisitions and dispositions  pay dividends and repurchase our stock 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenants or otherwise breach the covenants that we are subject to under our borrowing arrangements  our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations 
such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  our credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets  including the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
if we cannot repay all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit agreement  our lenders could proceed against our assets 

table of contents we may be unsuccessful in completing the divestiture of the strawberry shortcake and care bears properties 
we have entered into agreements to sell our strawberry shortcake and care bears properties 
these transactions have failed to close as scheduled  and have resulted in three separate legal proceedings involving us and our subsidiary  those characters from cleveland  inc for more information regarding the legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
if we are unable to sell these properties  it could limit some of our financial flexibility due to the absence of additional liquidity that would have been available from the proceeds of the transaction 
for information regarding the proposed divestiture of these properties  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item pending litigation could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  and cash flows 
as described in item legal proceedings  we are engaged in several lawsuits which may require significant management time and attention and legal expense  and may result in an unfavorable outcome  which could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  and cash flows 
current estimates of loss regarding pending litigation are based on information that is then available to us and may not reflect any particular final outcome 
the results of rulings  judgments or settlements of pending litigation may result in financial liability that is materially higher than what management has estimated at this time 
we make no assurances that we will not be subject to liability with respect to current or future litigation 
we maintain various forms of insurance coverage 
however  substantial rulings  judgments or settlements could exceed the amount of insurance coverage  or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy 
we may not realize the full benefit of the material we license from third parties if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 
an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various popular brands  celebrities  character properties  design and other licensed material owned by third parties 
such license agreements usually require that we pay an advance and or provide a minimum royalty guarantee that may be substantial  and in some cases may be greater than what we will be able to recoup in profits from actual sales  which could result in write offs of such amounts that would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may acquire or renew licenses requiring minimum guarantee payments that may result in us paying higher effective royalties  if the overall benefit of obtaining the license outweighs the risk of potentially losing  not renewing or otherwise not obtaining a valuable license 
when obtaining a license  we realize there is no guarantee that a particular licensed property will make a successful greeting card or other product in the eye of the ultimate consumer 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a successful licensed property will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future 
in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our inability to protect or defend our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands 
we believe that our trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brands  success and competitive position 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secrets  and patent laws in the united states and similar laws in other jurisdictions and on confidentiality and other types of agreements with some employees  vendors  consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these measures  if we are unable to successfully file for  register or otherwise enforce our rights or if these rights are infringed  invalidated  challenged  circumvented  or misappropriated  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
also  we are  and may in the future be  subject to intellectual property rights claims in the united states or foreign countries  which could limit our ability to use certain intellectual property  products or brands in the future 
defending any such claims  even claims without merit  could be 
table of contents time consuming  result in costly settlements  litigation or restrictions on our business and damage our reputation 
rapidly changing trends in the children s entertainment market could adversely affect our business 
a portion of our business and results of operations depends upon the appeal of our licensed character properties  which are used to create various toy and entertainment items for children 
consumer preferences  particularly among children  are continuously changing 
the children s entertainment industry experiences significant  sudden and often unpredictable shifts in demand caused by changes in the preferences of children to more on trend entertainment properties 
in recent years  there have been trends towards shorter life cycles for individual youth entertainment products 
our ability to maintain our current market share and increase our market share in the future depends on our ability to satisfy consumer preferences by enhancing existing entertainment properties and developing new entertainment properties 
if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for our collection of entertainment properties could decrease and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we may incur significant costs developing entertainment properties that may not generate future revenues at the levels that we anticipated  which could in turn create fluctuations in our reported results based on when those costs are expensed and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
the social expression industry is a seasonal business  with sales generally being higher in the second half of our fiscal year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
consequently  our overall results of operations in the future may fluctuate substantially based on seasonal demand for our products 
such variations in demand could have a material adverse effect on the timing of cash flow and therefore our ability to meet our obligations with respect to our debt and other financial commitments 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  since we usually order and manufacture merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new trends are confirmed by customer orders or consumer purchases 
we must carry significant amounts of inventory  especially before the holiday season selling period 
if we are not successful in selling the inventory during the holiday period  we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices  or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all 
increases in raw material and energy costs may materially raise our costs and materially impact our profitability 
paper is a significant expense in the production of our greeting cards 
significant increases in paper prices  which have been volatile in past years  or increased costs of other raw materials or energy  such as fuel  may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our greeting cards and other social expression products 
the loss of key members of our senior management and creative teams could adversely affect our business 
our success and continued growth depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our current senior management team as well as upon a number of key members of our creative staff  who have been instrumental in our success thus far  and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly capable and creative individuals 
the loss of some of our senior executives or key members of our creative staff  or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals  could materially and adversely affect us 
we seek to compensate our key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership  bonus plans  or other incentives  but we can make no assurance that these programs will enable us to retain key employees or hire new employees 

table of contents if we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike  or other work stoppage  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
in particular  approximately  of our us employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work related stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
employee benefit costs constitute a significant element of our annual expenses  and funding these costs could adversely affect our financial condition 
employee benefit costs are a significant element of our cost structure 
certain expenses  particularly postretirement costs under defined benefit pension plans and healthcare costs for employees and retirees  may increase significantly at a rate that is difficult to forecast and may adversely affect our financial results  financial condition or cash flows 
in addition  at this point  we are unable to determine the impact that newly enacted federal healthcare legislation could have on our employer sponsored medical plans 
declines in global capital markets may cause reductions in the value of our pension plan assets 
such circumstances could have an adverse effect on future pension expense and funding requirements 
further information regarding our retirement benefits is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item various environmental regulations and risks applicable to a manufacturer and or distributor of consumer products may require us to take actions  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state  provincial  local and foreign laws and regulations  including regulations with respect to chemical usage  air emissions  wastewater and storm water discharges and other releases into the environment as well as the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  including hazardous materials 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  because legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements  which may be significant  or the effect on our operations as these laws and regulations may give rise to claims  uncertainties or possible loss contingencies for future environmental remediation liabilities and costs 
we cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations  will not have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the impact of environmental laws and regulations  regulatory enforcement activities  the discovery of unknown conditions  and third party claims for damages to the environment  real property or persons could result in additional liabilities and costs in the future 
we may be subject to product liability claims and our products could be subject to voluntary or involuntary recalls and other actions 
we are subject to numerous federal and state regulations governing product safety including  but not limited to  those regulations enforced by the consumer product safety commission 
a failure to comply with such regulations  or concerns about product safety may lead to a recall of selected products 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  recalls and defects or errors in products after their production and sale to customers 
such recalls and defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by our retail customers and consumers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs  any of which could harm our business 
individuals could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
governmental agencies could pursue us and issue civil fines and or criminal penalties for a failure to comply with product 
table of contents safety regulations 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
additionally  we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future 
recalls  post manufacture repairs of our products  product liability claims  absence or cost of insurance and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm our reputation  increase costs or reduce sales 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving  and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could harm our business and results of operations 
we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  restrictions on imports and exports  customs  tariffs  user privacy  data protection  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  electronic contracts and other communications  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services  broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property use and ownership  sales and other taxes  fraud  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e commerce 
those laws that do reference the internet are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain 
for example  the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  is intended  in part  to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for including or for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others 
portions of the communications decency act  or cda  are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content 
we rely on the protections provided by both the dmca and cda in conducting our ag interactive business 
any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business 
the children s online privacy protection act is intended to impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors 
in addition  the protection of children from sexual predators act of requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
the costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them 
further  any failures on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities 
those current and future laws and regulations or unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations 
information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 
we depend heavily on our information technology it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives 
portions of our it infrastructure are old and difficult to maintain 
we could experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure  such as a computer virus  a problem with the functioning of an important it application  or an intentional disruption of our it systems 
in addition  our it systems could suffer damage or interruption from human error  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  terrorist attacks  acts of war and similar events 
the disruptions caused by any such events could impede our ability to record or process orders  manufacture and ship in a timely manner  properly store consumer images  or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course 
any such event could cause us to lose customers or revenue  damage our reputation  and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 
we are refreshing our it systems in stages in an effort to redesign and deploy new processes  organization structures and a common information system over a number of years 
such an implementation carries substantial operations risk  including loss of data or information  unanticipated increases in costs  disruption of operations or business interruption 
further  we may not be successful implementing new systems or any new system may not perform as expected 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents acts of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials  other catastrophic events  including earthquakes  could interrupt critical functions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations 
acts of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials or a shortage of raw materials  which could influence the cost of goods supplied to us 
additionally  we have significant operations  including our largest manufacturing facility  near a major earthquake fault line in arkansas 
a catastrophic event  such as an earthquake  fire  tornado  or other natural or man made disaster  could disrupt our operations and impair production or distribution of our products  damage inventory  interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect our business negatively  harming our results of operations 
members of the weiss family and related entities  whose interests may differ from those of other shareholders  own a substantial portion of our common shares 
our authorized capital stock consists of class a common shares and class b common shares 
the economic rights of each class of common shares are identical  but the voting rights differ 
class a common shares are entitled to one vote per share and class b common shares are entitled to ten votes per share 
there is no public trading market for the class b common shares  which are held by members of the extended family of american greetings founder  officers and directors of american greetings and their extended family members  family trusts  institutional investors and certain other persons 
as of april   morry weiss  the chairman of the board of directors  zev weiss  the chief executive officer  jeffrey weiss  the president and chief operating officer  and erwin weiss  the senior vice president  enterprise resource planning  together with other members of the weiss family and certain trusts and foundations established by the weiss family beneficially owned approximately in the aggregate of our outstanding class b common shares approximately  excluding stock options that are presently exercisable or exercisable within days of april   which  together with class a common shares beneficially owned by them  represents approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock approximately  excluding stock options that are presently exercisable or exercisable within days of april  
accordingly  these members of the weiss family  together with the trusts and foundations established by them  would be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation or code of regulations  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions  and their interests may not be aligned with your interests 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it less likely that any other shareholder will be able to affect our management or strategic direction 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or voting control or its acquisition by a third party 
our charter documents and ohio law may inhibit a takeover and limit our growth opportunities  which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
certain provisions of ohio law and our charter documents  together or separately  could have the effect of discouraging  or making it more difficult for  a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of american greetings and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares 
for example  our charter documents establish a classified board of directors  serving staggered three year terms  allow the removal of directors only for cause  and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings 
in addition  while shareholders have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors  class b common shares have ten votes per share which limits the ability of holders of class a common shares to elect a director by exercising cumulative voting rights

our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia and new zealand as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
during  we shutdown our subsidiary in mexico and now supply the mexican market through a third party distributor 
we achieved significantly improved operating income in compared to the prior year 
this improvement was partially driven by several major actions taken during the past year as we capitalized on market opportunities to leverage ourselves for future success 
the following transactions and activities have occurred in the past thirteen months february  acquisition of rpg  april  acquisition of the papyrus trademark and wholesale business division of schurman that supplies papyrus brand greeting cards to specialty  mass merchandise  grocery and drug store channels  april  divestiture of our retail operations segment  september  execution of a distribution agreement with a distributor in mexico and determination to shutdown our operations in mexico  and december  transaction the party goods transaction with amscan  inc  a leading designer  manufacturer and distributor of party goods 
the acquisitions of rpg and papyrus align with our corporate strategy of growing our main greeting card business by building on our core competencies of greeting cards 
in addition  the change in business mix resulting from our divestiture of company owned retail stores  which had historically generated an operating loss  to the rpg and papyrus wholesale greeting card business  which were accretive to operating income  drove a portion of our operating income improvement compared to the prior year 
the decision to close our distribution facility in mexico and transition to a third party distributor model was the result of a comprehensive review of alternatives designed to reduce costs 
at the same time  we recognize the importance of the mexican market and this solution allows us to provide continuity of service to this market with a lower cost structure 
in addition  the transition to a third party distributor model is expected to provide a more cost effective method of servicing and merchandising product to retail customers in mexico while focusing our resources on designing relevant spanish language products 

table of contents we expect that the party goods transaction will enable us to reduce our cost structure within the party goods product lines by discontinuing the manufacture of party goods 
we intend to leverage our existing distribution strengths and continue to supply party goods to various channels  including mass merchandisers  drug  grocery and specialty retail partners 
as a result of the party goods transaction  we expect that we will be able to offer a broader assortment of licensed and non licensed party goods products to our retail partners 
however  we expect total sales of party goods products to be reduced as a result of this transaction 
in conjunction with this transaction  we announced the closure of the party goods manufacturing and distribution facility in kalamazoo  michigan 
distribution of party goods will be moved to our other distribution facilities 
the transactions and activities discussed above generated significant gains  losses and expenses during as detailed below party goods mexico retail transaction shut down disposition total net sales material  labor and other production costs selling  distribution and marketing expenses administrative and general expenses other operating income expense net the impact of the party goods transaction includes a million gain on the transaction and approximately million of asset impairments and severance charges associated with the facility closure 
we recorded million associated with the shut down of the distribution facility in mexico  including million related to the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of equity that was written off upon liquidation and million of severance  asset impairments and other closing expenses 
we generated a loss on the disposition of the retail operations segment of million 
in addition to the operating income improvements from the above strategic actions  also contributing to our improved operating results were the benefits we realized during the year from our continued focus on the efficiency of our operations  including tightened control of overhead costs and reductions in supply chain  scrap  and distribution costs due to an improved balance of card unit shipments with card unit net sales 
during  we also realized the benefits associated with the elimination of approximately positions during the prior year fourth quarter 
we recognized net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in  on total revenue of billion in compared to billion in foreign currency movements and the change in business mix were the primary drivers of the lower consolidated revenues of approximately million 
partially offsetting these decreases was a reduction of certain deferred cost reserves of approximately million 
this lower reserve balance is the result of improvements in the historical trends and a reduced average term 
see critical accounting policies for additional information 
unfavorable foreign currency movements  due to a strengthening of the us dollar  accounted for slightly more than half of the total revenue decline  at approximately million 
in addition  the revenue loss from the retail operations segment divestiture was only partially offset by the revenue additions associated with the rpg and papyrus acquisitions  for a net decrease of approximately million 
operating income for was million compared to an operating loss of million in in addition to the improvements and charges discussed above  operating income included a benefit related to certain company owned life insurance programs  a charge related to the settlement of a legal claim and significantly more variable compensation expense than during due to the considerably higher level of net income 
for a description of the legal claim and the settlement thereof  see part i  item legal proceedings 

table of contents the prior year operating loss included goodwill  intangible and fixed assets impairments totaling approximately million  caused primarily by the global economic slowdown and our declining stock price during the prior year fourth quarter 
our improvement was broad based as all reporting segments experienced higher operating income in compared to the north american social expression products and the international social expression products segments both reported higher revenues  with everyday cards driving the improvement in the north american social expression products segment and non card product  as a result of new product introductions  causing growth in the international social expression products segment 
the ag interactive segment reported lower revenues compared to the prior year primarily due to lower advertising revenue within our online product group  as market conditions for on line advertising remained soft throughout the year

this  or approximately million  decrease was primarily the result of lower net sales in our retail operations segment of approximately million  unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately million and a decrease in net sales in our ag interactive segment of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in our north american social expression products segment of approximately million and increased net sales in our international social expression products segment of approximately million due to improved sales of gifting and other non card products 
net sales of our north american social expression products segment increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
greeting cards improved approximately million  due to the acquisitions of rpg and papyrus  which added approximately million  as well as growth in our legacy greeting card business of approximately million and the impact of lower deferred cost reserves of approximately 
table of contents million 
this increase was partially offset by lower accessories sales of approximately million  including gift packaging  calendars and party goods  as well as lower sales of approximately million in mexico as we began winding down our operations there in the third quarter of net sales of our retail operations segment decreased approximately million due to the sale of this business in april approximately million of sales is included in compared to approximately million of sales in the prior year 
net sales of our ag interactive segment decreased approximately million compared to the decrease is due primarily to lower e commerce revenue in our digital photography product group and lower advertising revenue in our online product group  as market conditions continue to be challenging  partially offset by increased subscription revenue in our online product group 
the contribution of each major product category as a percentage of net sales for the past two fiscal years was as follows everyday greeting cards seasonal greeting cards gift packaging all other products the all other products classification includes  among other things  giftware  party goods  calendars  custom display fixtures  stickers  online greeting cards and other digital products

the overall increase was driven by the rpg and papyrus acquisitions 
everyday card sales less returns were up  compared to the prior year  as a result of increases in both unit volume and selling prices of and  respectively 
the increase in unit volume was the result of the rpg and papyrus acquisitions 
increased selling prices were driven primarily by our north american social expression products segment where higher priced technology and papyrus cards are continuing to improve average prices despite the growing volume of value line cards 
seasonal card sales less returns increased compared to the prior year as a result of increases in unit volume of 
this increase in unit volume was driven by the acquisitions of rpg and papyrus as well as improvements in the easter  christmas and father s day seasonal programs 
the decrease in selling prices of related primarily to the continued mix shift towards value priced cards across most seasonal programs and a more balanced offering of technology cards 

table of contents expense overview material  labor and other production costs mlopc for were million  a decrease from million in as a percentage of total revenue  these costs were in compared to in the decrease of million is driven by our continued focus on the efficiency of our operations  including tightened control of costs  reductions in supply chain  scrap  and distribution costs due to an improved balance of card unit shipments with card unit net sales  a favorable change in the product mix  and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately million 
the favorable product mix of approximately million is primarily due to a sales shift towards lower cost card products versus non card products 
this shift to a higher mix of greeting cards was due to the acquisition of rpg and papyrus as well as increased net sales within our legacy greeting card business  as well as lower sales of gift packaging  calendars and party goods products 
the disposition of the retail operations segment  which sold many non card gifting products  also contributed to the favorable mix 
the lower costs are also attributable to decreased scrap and shrink million and the lifo liquidation million that we experienced during the year as a result of improved inventory management 
the remaining decrease of approximately million is attributable to lower product input costs  realization of other cost savings initiatives put in place during the fourth quarter of and a favorable volume variance 
the prior year included costs million associated with the conversion to our new canadian line of cards and expenses million associated with our production of film based entertainment  both of which did not recur in partially offsetting these decreases were current year impairment and severance charges related to the closure of the kalamazoo  michigan facility million and inventory charges associated with the wind down of our mexico distribution facility million 
selling  distribution and marketing expenses sdm were million in  decreasing from million in the prior year 
the decrease of million is due to lower spending million and favorable foreign currency translation million 
the decreased spending is a result of the elimination of the costs to operate our retail stores million due to the disposition of those stores during the first quarter of  reduced supply chain costs million  specifically freight and distribution costs  due to a decrease in units shipped  as well as less expenses in our licensing business million 
the lower expenses in our licensing business are attributable to the benefits from prior year overhead reductions and less agency fees in line with the decrease in royalty revenue in these favorable variances were substantially offset by ongoing sdm expenses million from our recent rpg and papyrus acquisitions 
administrative and general expenses were million in  an increase from million in the million increase is due to increased spending million offset by favorable foreign currency translation impacts million 
the increase in spending is primarily driven by variable compensation expense million which includes bonus  profit sharing contributions  and k matching contributions and the settlement of a legal claim million 
the prior year included a nominal amount of variable compensation expenses  as we did not meet the operating results required to make these variable compensation payments 
these increases were partially offset by a corporate owned life insurance benefit million due to higher than average death benefit income reported by our third party administrators  lower bad debt expense million and savings from prior year cost reduction initiatives 
during the prior year  goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of million were recorded

the new notes are contractually subordinated to amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  and are effectively subordinated to any other secured indebtedness that we may issue from time to time to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the new notes and the additional senior notes generally contain comparable covenants as described above for our credit agreement 
the new notes also provide that if we incur more than an additional million of indebtedness other than indebtedness under the credit agreement or certain other permitted indebtedness  such indebtedness must be a pari passu in right of payment to the new notes and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the credit agreement at least to the same extent as the new notes  or b expressly subordinated in right of payment to the new notes 
alternatively  we can redeem the new notes in whole  but not in part  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest  if any  or have the subordination provisions removed from the new notes 
at february   we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the borrowing agreements described above 
the total fair value of our publicly traded debt  based on quoted market prices  was million at a carrying value of million and million at a carrying value of million at february  and  respectively 
the carrying amount of our publicly traded debt significantly exceeded its fair value at february  due to the tighter us credit markets 
the total fair value of our non publicly traded debt  term loan and revolving credit facility  based on comparable publicly traded debt prices  was million at a carrying value of million and million at a carrying value of million at february  and  respectively 

table of contents we will continue to consider all options for capital deployment including growth options  capital expenditures  the opportunity to repurchase our own shares  or by reducing debt 
to this end  in january  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of class a common shares  that may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant  at prices we deem appropriate  and subject to applicable legal requirements and other factors 
there is no set expiration date for this program 
we also may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  including strategically repurchasing our senior unsecured notes due in at a discount to par 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
our future operating cash flow and borrowing availability under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of the business results in peak working capital requirements that may be financed through short term borrowings 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of february  payment due by period as of february  in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases commitments under customer agreements commitments under royalty agreements interest payments severance commitments under purchase agreements approximately million of the operating lease commitments in the table above relate to retail stores acquired by schurman that are being conditionally subleased to schurman 
the failure of schurman to operate the retail stores successfully could have a material adverse effect on the corporation  because if schurman is not able to comply with its obligations under the subleases  the corporation remains contractually obligated  as primary lessee  under those leases 
the interest payments in the above table are determined assuming the same level of debt outstanding in the future years as at february  for the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility at the current average interest rates for those facilities 
in addition to the contracts noted in the table  we issue purchase orders for products  materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of business 
these purchase orders typically do not include long term volume commitments  are based on pricing terms previously negotiated with vendors and are generally cancelable with the appropriate notice prior to receipt of the materials or supplies 
accordingly  the foregoing table excludes open purchase orders for such products  materials and supplies as of february  although we do not anticipate that contributions will be required in to the defined benefit pension plan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of gibson greetings  inc in  we may make contributions in excess of the legally required minimum contribution level 
refer to note to the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
we do anticipate that contributions will be required beginning in fiscal  but those amounts have not been determined as of february  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required allowance balances 
sales returns we provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return  primarily seasonal cards  certain other seasonal products and everyday cards at certain foreign locations  in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentives to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated term of the agreement or the effective time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain an allowance for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific allowance to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected recoverability 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for those contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  we periodically review the progress toward the volume commitment and estimate future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect our estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry 
table of contents consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon our review  we may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
we do not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years as amounts  if any  have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 
the accuracy of our assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon our ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with asc topic asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we may use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asc topic asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements

this update is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this update on march  in december  the fasb issued asc topic asc  consolidation  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests ie minority interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
under the standard  noncontrolling interests are considered equity and should be clearly identified  presented and disclosed on the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
this guidance is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  however  presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements 
we adopted this standard on march  the adoption of this standard does not materially impact our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued an update to asc topic asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
this update amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc the intent of this updated guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the original guidance within asc and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under other us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
certain disclosure requirements shall be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
the adoption of this updated standard on march  did not materially impact our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc topic asc  compensation retirement benefits 
this update provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
it requires disclosure of additional information about investment allocation  fair values of major categories of assets  the development of fair value measurements and concentrations of risk 
asc is effective for fiscal years ending after december   however  earlier application is permitted 
we adopted this standard during in april  the fasb issued an update to asc topic  financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in both interim and annual financial statements 
this update is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early application permitted 
we adopted this updated standard in the second quarter of since this guidance only requires additional disclosures  adoption of the standard did not materially impact our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asc topic  subsequent events 
asc topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  we adopted this standard in the second quarter of in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
asu amends disclosure requirements within subtopic an entity that is a filer with the securities and exchange commission sec is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this change alleviates potential conflicts between subtopic and the sec s requirements 
all of the amendments in asu that are applicable to us are effective upon issuance 
our adoption of this update during the fourth quarter of did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb asc as the authoritative source of gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
this statement is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  the asc supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
since the 
table of contents asc does not change existing gaap  our adoption of this standard during the third quarter of did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard pertaining to the consolidation of a variable interest entity vie that improves financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies and requires an ongoing reassessment of determining whether a variable interest gives a company a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this standard also eliminates the quantitative approach to determining whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie previously required by fasb guidance 
this statement is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after february  we are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our financial statements  particularly our interest in schurman  which  is a vie as defined in asc although our interest in schurman is a significant variable interest  under the standard existing prior to the issuance of the new guidance on vies  it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of schurman and as such  schurman does not need to be consolidated into our results 
if  under the new standard  it is determined that we have a controlling financial interest in schurman  we will be required to consolidate schurman s operations into our results 
the initial determination must be made in our first quarter of and such determination must be reevaluated in all interim and annual periods going forward 
if we are required to consolidate schurman  it could materially affect our results of operations and financial position as we would be required to include a portion of schurman s income or losses and assets and liabilities into our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu provides amendments to subtopic that require separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements in addition to the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level fair value measurements 
asu also provides amendments to subtopic that clarify existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements of level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  as asu only requires enhanced disclosures  we do not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following a weak retail environment and general economic conditions  the ability to achieve both the desired benefits from the party goods transaction as well as ensuring a seamless transition for affected retail customers and consumers  the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  including the recent acquisitions of rpg and papyrus  our ability to successfully complete the sale of the strawberry shortcake and care bears properties  our successful transition of the retail operations segment to its buyer  schurman fine papers  and schurman s ability to successfully operate its retail operations and satisfy its obligations to us  retail consolidations  acquisitions and bankruptcies  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  
table of contents the ability to achieve the desired benefits associated with our cost reduction efforts  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  our ability to comply with our debt covenants and to refinance our debt on acceptable terms as the debt instruments mature  the timing and impact of investments in new retail or product strategies as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  the impact of technology on core product sales  the timing and impact of converting customers to a scan based trading model  escalation in the cost of providing employee health care  the ability to successfully implement  or achieve the desired benefits associated with  any information systems refresh we may implement  our ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from any share repurchase programs  fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where we operate  including the us dollar  euro  us pound sterling  and canadian dollar  and the outcome of any legal claims known or unknown 
risks pertaining specifically to ag interactive include the viability of online advertising  subscriptions as revenue generators  and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing social media and the digital photo sharing space 
the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward looking statements  refer to the risk factors section included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments we had no derivative financial instruments as of february  interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 
foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and total revenue from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australia  new zealand  canada  mexico  the european union and the uk are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates
