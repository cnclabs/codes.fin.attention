economy and industry the chinese economy began to experience a slowing growth rate during the global financial crisis in the latter half of in  the chinese government carried out a series of stimulus plans and the chinese economy recovered gradually with gdp growth exceeding 
heading into  it is uncertain how strong the economy recovery in china will be and how long it will take the economy to go back to normal 
however  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the economy recovery 
for the portal business  we are focusing on our long term strategic vision to make sohu one of the most powerful mainstream media platforms in china 
we believe a modest macro environment provides great media driven opportunity for us 
moreover  our online game business has been more resilient to the weak economic condition and continues to show growth momentum 
this more than offsets any temporary impact on our portal business brought on by the economy weakness 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the revenue recognition  the share based compensation expense recognition  income taxes and uncertain tax positions  recognition of 
table of contents noncontrolling interest  computation of net income per share  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of impairment for long lived assets and goodwill  and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services and sponsored search services 
advertising revenue is recognized after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax 
the advertising revenue recognition involves certain management judgments 
the amount and timing of our advertising revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we do not enter into advertising for advertising barter transactions 
brand advertising revenues for brand advertising revenues  a contract is signed to establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
based on the contracts  we provide advertisement placements on our different website channels and or in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
for brand advertising revenue recognition  prior to entering into contracts  we make a credit assessment of the customer to assess the collectability of the contract 
for those contracts for which the collectability was assessed as reasonably assured  we recognize revenue ratably over the period during which the advertising services were provided and when all revenue recognition criteria were met 
for those contracts for which the collectability was assessed as not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue only when the cash was received and all revenue recognition criteria were met 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
as one kind of brand advertising services  sponsorship service is similar to other brand advertising services but generally with larger amount and for a longer contractual period 
sponsorship service may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our websites  and may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premier placements 
sponsorship advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sponsored search revenues sponsored search services mainly include priority placements services and pay for click services 
the priority placements services are placed in our search directory and are normally provided for a fixed fee over the service period of the contracts 
pay for click services mainly consist of displaying the text based links of our advertisers on our websites and our website alliance network 
sponsored search contracts are normally for relatively small amounts and are signed with small and medium sized enterprises 
revenue for the priority placements services is normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for pay for click services is recognized on a per click basis when the users click on the displayed links 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
online game revenues game operation revenues we earn revenues from our current mmorpg operations by providing online services to game players pursuant to the item based revenue model 
for periods prior to our upgrading and re launching of bo in december  we operated bo under the time based revenue model  where game players are charged based on the time they spend playing the game 
under the item based revenue model  game players play games free of charge and are charged for purchases of virtual items 
under both the item based and the time based revenue models  proceeds received from sales of prepaid cards are initially recorded as receipts in advance 
proceeds from sale of prepaid cards to distributors are deferred when received and  for the item based revenue model  revenue is recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased or as the virtual items are consumed 
for the time based revenue model  revenue is recognized based upon the actual usage of time units by the game players 
the revenues are recorded net of business tax  sales discounts and rebates to our distributors 

table of contents under our item based revenue model  game players can access our games free of charge  but may purchase consumable virtual items  including those with a pre determined expiration time  such as three months  or perpetual items  such as certain costumes that stay bound to a game player for the life of the game 
revenues in relation to consumable virtual items are recognized as they are consumed  as our services in connection with these items have been fully rendered to our game players as of that time 
revenues in relation to perpetual virtual items are recognized over their estimated lives 
we will provide continuous online game services in connection with these perpetual virtual items until they are no longer used by our game players 
we have considered the average period that game players typically play our games and other game player behavior patterns to arrive at our best estimates for the lives of these perpetual virtual items 
we have also considered that the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items may be affected by various factors  including the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs  promotional events launched and market conditions 
however  given the relatively short operating history of our games  and of our most popular game tlbb in particular  our estimate of the period that game players typically play our games may not accurately reflect the estimated lives of the perpetual virtual items 
we have adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items on a quarterly basis 
all paying users data collected since the launch of the games are used to perform the relevant assessments 
historical behavior patterns of these paying users during the period between their first log on date and last log on date are used to estimate the lives of perpetual virtual items 
while we believe our estimates to be reasonable based on available game player information  we may revise such estimates in the future as our games operation periods become longer and we continue to gain more operating history and data 
any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of perpetual virtual items would be applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns 
any changes in our estimate of lives of perpetual virtual items may result in our revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods and may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
overseas licensing revenues we also derive online game revenues from licensing our games in other countries and territories 
the licensing agreements provided for two revenue streams  an initial license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty based on monthly revenues from the games 
the initial license fee consists of both a fixed amount and additional amounts receivable upon achieving certain sales targets 
since we are required to provide when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  both the fixed portion and the additional portion of the initial license fee are recognized ratably as revenue over the license period 
the fixed portion of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date the game is launched  and the additional portion of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date such additional amount is certain 
the monthly usage based royalty fee is recognized when earned  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
wireless and others revenues our wireless and others revenues are mainly from our wireless business 
wireless revenues are derived from a wide range of wireless products focused on entertainment  information and communications  such as short messaging services sms  ring back tone rbt  wireless application protocol wap  multi media messaging services mms and interactive voice response ivr 
we mainly offer news  weather forecasts  chatting  entertainment information  mobile phone ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related services to mobile phone users through contracts signed with third party mobile network operators 
wireless service fees are charged on a monthly or per message download basis 
due to the technical issues with the operator s network  we might unable to collect certain wireless service fees from an operator in certain circumstances 
this un collectability is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
wireless revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided that no significant obligations remain 
to recognize wireless revenue  we rely on china mobile network operators to provide us the billing confirmations for the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
at the end of each reporting period  when an operator has not provided us the monthly billing confirmations  we use the information generated from our internal system as well as the historical data to estimate the failure rate  to estimate the amount of collectable wireless service fees and to recognize revenue 
in the later period when we get the actual billing confirmation  we then record a true up accounting adjustment 
although we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates  the differences between the actual facts and our estimations may result in significant fluctuations in the amount and timing of the revenue recognized 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by the monthly billing confirmations received from the mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  we receive billing confirmations from each of the operators confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering billing confirmations  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  for the month to us 
our management must determine whether to record our wireless revenues using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  the primary factors are whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction and the specific requirement of each contract 
currently  we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services  and as such a majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received on a gross basis  and report as costs of revenue the amounts 
table of contents attributable to services provided by mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report on a net basis as revenue the payments received less commission and other payments to third parties 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating terms of the arrangement 
the related commissions and or other payments to third parties are recorded as costs or expenses 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense is for share awards  including ordinary shares  share options  restricted shares and restricted share units granted by sohu 
com inc and changyou 
com limited to their employees and directors 
share based compensation expense is recognized as costs and or expenses in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair values of the related share awards on their grant dates 
for share awards granted by sohu 
com inc  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the black scholes valuation model is applied  in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted  the fair value of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for share awards granted by changyou 
com limited  in determining the fair value of the ordinary shares  restricted shares and restricted share units granted in  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability is applied given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in before changyou s initial public offering  the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on changyou s offering price for its initial public offering 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after changyou s initial public offering  the fair value of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
share based compensation expense for the ordinary shares granted is fully recognized in the quarter during which these ordinary shares are granted 
share based compensation expense for share options  restricted shares and restricted share units granted is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
the number of share based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated  and the related compensation expense is not recorded for that number of awards 
the assumptions used in share based compensation expense recognition represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change or different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
moreover  the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on available evidence  it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses of sohu 
com inc that would be subject to corporate income tax in the united states us corporate income tax  and net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax basis for our china based subsidiaries and variable interest entities vies 
since substantially all of our income is earned through china based subsidiaries and vies  and in the foreseeable future we do not intend to repatriate income to the united states us where it would be subject to us corporate income tax  except that  under certain circumstances  we may repatriate to the us income that will be subject to us alternative minimum tax 
in the foreseeable future  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from the net operating losses of sohu 
com inc will not be realized 
hence  we recorded a valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
uncertain tax positions in order to assess uncertain tax positions  we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two step approach for the tax position measurement and financial statement recognition 
for the two step approach  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be 
table of contents sustained  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest nci is the portion of economic interest in sohu 
com inc s majority owned subsidiaries and vies which is not attributable  directly or indirectly  to sohu 
com inc currently  the nci in our consolidated financial statements consist of nci for changyou and east beijing  new east and east hong kong collectively east 
net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and  if dilutive  potential common shares outstanding during the period 
potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise of share based awards using the treasury stock method and shares issuable upon the conversion of zero coupon convertible senior notes using if converted method 
additionally  for purposes of calculating diluted net income per share  sohu s consolidated net income is adjusted for changyou s net income multiplied by the difference between a the percentage of the total economic interest in changyou held by sohu  and b the percentage of the weighted average number of changyou shares held by sohu to the weighted average number of changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise of share based awards 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our management makes estimations for the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the general allowance  many factors are considered including but not limited to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  performing aging analysis and customer credit analysis  analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends 
additional allowance for specific doubtful accounts might be made if the financial conditions of our customers or mobile network operators deteriorate or the mobile network operators are unable to collect fees from their end customers  resulting in their inability to make payments due to us 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  intangible assets and other assets 
fixed assets comprise computer equipment and hardware  office building  investment properties  leasehold improvements  vehicles and office furniture 
fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
intangible assets primarily comprise computer software  domain names  trademarks  marketing rights  operating rights for licensed games and customer lists purchased from unrelated third parties 
intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value 
amortization of intangible assets is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the weighted average amortization period for intangible assets is five years 
other assets primarily include prepaid content fees  prepaid license fees and rental deposits 
we amortize the content fees and license fees over the terms of the related contracts 
management s judgment is required in the assessment of the useful lives of long lived assets  and is required in the measurement of impairment 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors 
the discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management 
an impairment charge would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and vies 
goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at 
table of contents reporting unit level business segment on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
functional currency and foreign currency translation functional currency an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  normally that is the currency of the environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash 
management s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators  such as cash flows  sales price and market  expenses  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
the functional currency of sohu 
com inc is us dollar 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries and vies in the prc  united kingdom of great britain  malaysia and korea are rmb  great britain pound  malaysian ringgit and korean won  respectively  while the functional currency of our subsidiaries in us foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our china based subsidiaries and vies are translated into us dollars  our reporting currency  at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheets date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period 
foreign currency translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are accumulated in a separate component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
results of operations in  in order to focus more on our core businesses  we discontinued our unprofitable e commerce business 
as a result  the e commerce business was accounted for as a discontinued operation and our statements of operations separate the discontinued operation for all periods presented

accordingly  we reclassified the revenue and cost of revenue of the online game segment for the years prior to to conform to the classification

restrictions on cash transfers to sohu 
com inc to fund any cash requirements it may have  sohu 
com inc may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by sohu 
com limited and changyou  our wholly owned subsidiary and majority owned subsidiary 
since substantially all of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly and majority owned china based subsidiaries and vies  sohu 
com limited and changyou then may need to rely on dividends  loans or advances made by our prc subsidiary 
for changyou  substantially all of its operations are conducted through gamease  our vie  which generates all of our online game revenues 
as gamease is not owned by our subsidiaries  it is not able to make dividend payments to our subsidiaries 
instead  amazgame  our subsidiary in china  has entered into a number of contracts with gamease to provide services to gamease in return for cash payments 
in order for us to receive any dividends  loans or advances from amazgame  or to distribute any dividends to our shareholders  we may need to rely on these payments made from gamease to amazgame 
depending on the nature of services provided by amazgame to gamease  certain of these payments are subject to prc taxes  including business taxes and value added tax  which effectively reduce the amount that amazgame receives from gamease 
in addition  the prc government could impose restrictions on such payments or change the tax rates applicable to such payments 
in addition  regulations in the prc currently permit payment of dividends of a prc company  such as amazgame  only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in china 
amazgame  and our other china based subsidiaries which are wfoes  are also required to set aside at least of their after tax profit based on prc accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the cumulative amount reaches of their paid in capital 
these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends  or as loans or advances 
these wofes may also allocate a portion of its after tax profits  as determined by its board of directors  to their staff welfare and bonus funds  which may not be distributed to changyou 
com limited and or to sohu 
com limited  so may not be distributed to sohu 
com inc eventually

any dividends paid by wofes to their investors located in hk will be subject to a withholding tax at the rate of  which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution

impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the revised guidance requires more information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
it eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and requires additional disclosures 
this guidance will be effective at the start of a reporting entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued revised guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the revised guidance requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
additionally  the revised guidance requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for 
table of contents determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary

in october  the fasb issued new guidance on revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics and will often result in earlier revenue recognition 
the new guidance modifies the fair value requirements of previous guidance by allowing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and other vendor objective evidence voe  now referred to as tpe standing for third party evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
a vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when vsoe or tpe of the selling price cannot be determined 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under the new guidance 
the new guidance for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  resulting in the recognition of revenue similar to that for other tangible products 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  however  companies may be able to adopt as early as interim periods ended september  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively 
we have not early adopted the new guidance and are currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance

the amendments in this accounting standards update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
we believe there will be no material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard

to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure
