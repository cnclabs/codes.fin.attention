outlook from the end of through  the united states and global economies endured a period of substantial economic uncertainty  and the related financial markets experienced significant volatility 
while the financial markets showed signs of stabilization in the second half of  the us and global economies are still recovering and some companies continue to struggle 
if the future economic environment continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years  we could be negatively impacted if the financial viability of certain of our subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired 
in addition  the valuation of our pension assets was negatively affected by the volatility in the financial markets in  resulting in higher pension costs in should the financial markets experience further decline which impacts our plan asset returns  we could again have higher future pension costs and required plan funding than in prior years 
we conduct business primarily with us government customers under long term contracts and we have not materially changed our product and service offerings due to the current economic conditions 
the us government s budgetary processes give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that it is addressing 
we believe that our current contracts  and our strong backlog of previously awarded contracts align well with our customer s future needs  and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows from our businesses 
nonetheless  we recognize that no business is completely immune to the current economic 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation situation and new policy initiatives could adversely affect future defense spending levels  which could lower our expected future revenues 
certain programs in which we participate may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget and funds being utilized to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
we believe that our portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in and beyond  despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget 
we expect sales in to be in the range of to billion based on backlog funded and unfunded of approximately billion as of december  we describe in the following paragraphs the major industry and economic factors that may affect our future performance 
industry factors we are subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony  whereby demand for our products and services comes primarily from one customer  and by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix 
liquidity trends in light of the ongoing economic situation  we have evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term perspective 
we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines will be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expansion projects  pay federal  foreign  and state income taxes  fund pension and other post retirement benefit plans  and continue paying dividends to shareholders 
we have a committed billion revolving credit facility  with a maturity date of august   that can be accessed on a same day basis 
during the second quarter of  we issued million of year and million of year unsecured senior obligations 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears at fixed rates of percent and percent per annum  and the notes will mature on august   and august   respectively 
we can redeem these senior notes at our discretion at any time prior to maturity 
we are using the net proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes including debt repayment  acquisitions  share repurchases  pension plan funding  and working capital 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to retire million of percent senior debt that matured 
we believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for long term liquidity  if necessary  from such sources as the public or private capital markets  the sale of assets  sale and leaseback of operating assets  and leasing rather than purchasing new assets 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 
recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules on september   the cas board published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of ppa requirements 
the proposed cas rule includes provisions for a transition period from the existing cas requirement to a partially harmonized cas requirement 
as published  the proposed rule would partially mitigate the near term mismatch between ppa amended employee retirement income security act erisa minimum contribution requirements  which would not yet be recoverable under cas 
however  until the final rule is published  and to the extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate any mismatch between erisa funding requirements and cas  government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans in general would still experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and the cas recoverable pension costs 
the cas board is expected to issue a final rule in  which would apply to our contracts starting in we anticipate that contractors will be entitled to seek an equitable adjustment for the additional cas contract costs required by the final rule 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks today the united states faces a complex and rapidly changing national security environment 
the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats  terrorist acts  regional conflicts and cyber attacks  responses to which are increasingly dependent upon early threat identification 
national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion  deterrence  
table of contents northrop grumman corporation active defense  security and stability operations  or peacekeeping 
we believe that the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 
as a result  the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to include the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating stealth  long range  survivability  persistence and standoff capabilities 
advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms will also be a priority 
the united states is engaged in a multi front  multi decade struggle that we expect will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges 
the recently released quadrennial defense review emphasizes the related challenge of rebuilding readiness at a time when dod is pursuing growth  modernization and transformation of its forces and capabilities 
we do not expect defense requirements to change significantly in the foreseeable future  and the size of national security budgets is expected to remain responsive 
the fiscal year budget submitted by the president requests billion in discretionary authority for the dod base budget and an additional billion to support contingency operations  representing a slight increase over the budget 
although the president s budget request proposes reductions to certain programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete  we believe that spending on recapitalization and modernization of defense and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority 
our substantial new competitive opportunities include unmanned vehicles  reconnaissance and surveillance platforms  missile defense radar  satellite communications systems  restricted programs  cybersecurity  technical services and information technology contracts  and numerous international and homeland security programs 
in pursuit of these opportunities  we continue to focus on operational and financial performance for continued improvements in earnings in and beyond 
us government programs focused on areas involving intelligence  persistent surveillance  directed energy applications  and cyber space in which we either participate  or strive to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration and resources during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes 
in addition to domestic and international considerations  the pentagon faces its own near term and long term internal fiscal constraints as it attempts to balance competing pressures from within and adhere to calls for better economy  efficiency and accountability 
budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for our size and structure and the entire defense industry 
we have historically concentrated our efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne and space surveillance  battle management  systems integration  defense electronics  cybersecurity and information technology 
we have a significant presence in federal and civil information systems  the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines  space technology  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr  and missile systems 
we believe that our programs are a high priority for national defense  but under budgetary pressures  one or more of our programs may be reduced  extended  or terminated by our us government customers 
congress last year passed legislation to add further discipline and accountability to the acquisition system 
this legislation  the weapon system acquisition reform act of  requires dod to develop mechanisms to address cost  schedule and performance in establishing program requirements 
as acquisition reform progresses  we will continue to anticipate and respond to the actions of the pentagon and congress to determine their impact on our operations 
we provide certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of our product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act 
noncompliance found by any one agency may result in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 
we could experience material adverse effects on our business and results of operations if we were suspended or debarred from additional contracts 
we could be affected by future laws or regulations  including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives 
we recently established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions during the next five years 
to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and to meet this goal  we expect to incur capital and operating costs  but at this time we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

under the reorganization plan  we retained the ship engineering  logistics and technical service businesses under the amsec name the amsec businesses and  in exchange  saic received the aviation  combat systems and strike force integration services businesses the divested businesses 
we treated this reorganization as a step acquisition for the acquisition of saic s interests in the amsec businesses  and recognized a pre tax gain of million for the effective sale of our interests in the divested businesses

government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include  but are not limited to  certain legal costs  lobbying costs  charitable donations  interest expense and advertising costs 
our long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories flexibly priced contracts includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts 
cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs  but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability 
fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation firm fixed price contracts a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 
time and materials contracts are considered firm fixed price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 
the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer us other percent in millions government customers total of total flexibly priced firm fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fees  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical performance 
award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
award fee contracts are widely used throughout our operating segments 
examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the global hawk engineering and manufacturing development and the majority of satellite contracts 
compliance and monitoring we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview we derive the majority of our business from long term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government  which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for construction type and production type contracts and federal government contractors 
we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts 
we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government  such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers 
we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant revenue recognition gaap 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting we generally recognize revenues from our long term contracts under the cost to cost or the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the shipbuilding segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
we record sales under cost type contracts as costs are incurred 
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 
other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain service contracts we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers when services are performed 
service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements  primarily in information systems and technical services 
we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred  except that direct and incremental set up costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap for revenue arrangements with multiple elements 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 
cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability  productivity and cost of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 
we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned 
we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation purchase accounting and goodwill overview we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
for acquisitions completed through december   we recorded adjustments to fair value assessments to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months  and adjusted goodwill for the resolution of income tax uncertainties which extended beyond the purchase price allocation period 
in  we implemented new gaap accounting guidance related to business combinations that impacts how we record adjustments to fair values included in the purchase price allocation and the resolution of income tax uncertainties 
for acquisitions completed after january   any adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and subsequent resolution of uncertain tax positions are recognized in net earnings  rather than as adjustments to goodwill 
acquisition accruals we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures 
we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
we recorded these accruals in accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience 
tests for impairment we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november th of each year  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 
in order to test for potential impairment  we use a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies overview we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies  we record amounts as charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  and determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
environmental accruals we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations 
we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs  and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another  we record the minimum amount of the range 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation factors which could result in changes to the assessment of probability  range of estimated costs  and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties  financial insolvency of other responsible parties  changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
although we cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued  we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
litigation accruals litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
based upon the information available  we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
uncertain tax positions in  we adopted a new accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions  and made a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions at the date of adoption 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes 
if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in our tax return 
we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
penalties  if probable and reasonably estimable  are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item under existing gaap  prior to january   changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill  effective january   such changes will be recorded to income tax expense 
adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview we annually evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other post retirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside actuaries 
in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 
for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity  and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  our weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  holding all other assumptions constant  and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the percent accounting corridor in  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation would have decreased or increased pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits  and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december   by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
due to adverse capital market conditions in our pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately percent in as a result  substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial losses outside the percent accounting corridor at the end of  thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense 
as a result of this condition  sensitivity of net periodic costs to changes in the discount rate were much higher in than was the case in and prior 
this condition is expected to continue into the near future 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption for  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease our pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million 
health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for  we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in in  we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent be reached in differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on post retirement benefit results percentage percentage in millions point increase point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to post retirement benefit expense post retirement benefit liability consolidated operating results selected financial highlights are presented in the table below

see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item operating income loss we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and  as is typical in the industry  we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 
we also further evaluate operating income for each of the business segments in which we operate 
we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income 
segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment  neither of which affect the segments  and the reversal of royalty income  which is classified as other  net for financial reporting purposes 
segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance 
segment operating income is not  however  a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner

the net pension adjustment in was an expense of million  as compared with income of million and million in and  respectively 
the net pension expense in was primarily the result of negative returns on plan assets in the income in and was due to decreased gaap pension expense  primarily resulting from better than estimated investment returns in prior years and higher discount rate assumptions

segment operating results basis of presentation realignments in january  we streamlined our organizational structure by reducing the number of operating segments from seven to five 
the five segments are aerospace systems  which combines the former integrated systems and space technology segments  electronic systems  information systems  which combines the former information technology and mission systems segments  shipbuilding  and technical services 
creation of the aerospace systems and information systems segments is intended to strengthen alignment with customers  improve our ability to execute on programs and win new business  and enhance our cost competitiveness 
during the first quarter of  we realigned certain logistics  services  and technical support programs and transferred assets from the information systems and electronic systems segments to the technical services segment 
this realignment is intended to strengthen our core capability in aircraft and electronics maintenance  repair and overhaul  life cycle optimization  and training and simulation services 
the sales and segment operating income in the following tables have been revised to reflect the above realignments for all periods presented 
during the first quarter of  we transferred certain optics and laser programs from the information systems segment to the aerospace systems segment 
we did not reclassify the prior year sales and segment operating income in the following tables to reflect this business transfer as the operating results of this business were not considered material

product sales are predominantly generated in the aerospace systems  electronic systems and shipbuilding segments  while the majority of our service revenues are generated by the information systems and technical services segments 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation sales and service revenues period to period sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume 
unless otherwise described  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels  delivery rates  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 
segment operating income segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far  and therefore not allocated to the segments 
changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume  as discussed above  or performance 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract 
operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 
operating income may also be affected by  among other things  the effects of workforce stoppages  the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes  resolution of disputed items with the customer  recovery of insurance proceeds  and other discrete events 
at the completion of a long term contract  any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings

liquidity and capital resources we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value 
we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements  capital expenditures  strategic business acquisitions and divestitures  debt repayments  required and voluntary pension contributions  and returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making  including net cash provided by operations  free cash flow  net debt to equity  and net debt to capital 
we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 
the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 
year ended december in millions net earnings earnings from discontinued operations gain on sale of business impairment of goodwill other non cash items retiree benefit funding in excess of expense trade working capital increase decrease cash provided by discontinued operations net cash provided by operating activities includes depreciation amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred taxes 
free cash flow free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs 
outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transition set up 
these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life 
we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors as it reflects our ability to grow by funding strategic business acquisitions and return value to shareholders through repurchasing our shares and paying dividends 
free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
this measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance
