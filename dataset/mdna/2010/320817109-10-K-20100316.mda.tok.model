item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles require management to apply significant judgment to certain accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply those principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical 
for a complete discussion of the corporation s significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussion throughout this annual report on form k 
below is a discussion of the corporation s critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the corporation s financial statements 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the corporation s audit committee 
on july   the accounting standards codification asc became fasb s officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  aicpa  eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the asc affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the asc involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation s loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the corporation s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative credit policies and underwriting criteria for all loans  as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a regional geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit quality reviews and management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the corporation s allowance consists of three components probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans  probable losses estimated from historical loss rates  and probable losses resulting from economic  environmental  qualitative or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in asc any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the corporation evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans  are not individually risk graded 
reserves are established for each pool of loan using loss rates based on a three year average net charge off history by loan category and the probable losses resulting from economic  environmental  qualitative or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the historical component 
historical loss allocations for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in loan growth and charge off rates  changes in mix  concentrations of loans in specific industries  asset quality trends delinquencies  charge offs and nonaccrual loans  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the corporation s internal loan review 
the corporation s primary market areas for lending are central indiana and butler  franklin and hamilton counties in ohio 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the corporation s customers 
see additional information in the provision allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
valuation of securities 
the corporation s available for sale security portfolio is reported at fair value 
the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
the investment securities portfolio is evaluated for otti by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate otti model 
investment securities are generally evaluated for otti under asc however  certain purchased beneficial interest  including certain non agency mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations are evaluated using the model outlined in asc in determining otti under asc  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 

table of contents part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued when otti occurs under either model  the amount of otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the corporation intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not the corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any recognized credit loss 
if the intent is to sell or it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any recognized credit loss  the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis  less any recognized credit loss  and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the intent is not to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis less any recognized credit loss  the otti has been separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors has been recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
pension 
the corporation provides pension benefits to its employees 
its accounting policies related to pensions and other postretirement benefits reflect the guidance in asc  compensation retirement benefits 
the corporation does not consolidate the assets and liabilities associated with the pension plan 
instead  the corporation recognizes the funded status of the plan in the balance sheet 
the measurement of the funded status and the annual pension expense involves actuarial and economic assumptions 
various statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions on the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  expected rates of salary increases and health care costs and trends 
the corporation considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions 
the primary assumptions used in determining the corporation s pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in note pension and other post retirement benefit plans  to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
goodwill and intangibles 
for purchase acquisitions  the corporation is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis  if events or changes indicate that the asset may be impaired  indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the corporation has historically elected to test for goodwill impairment as of september of each year 
based on the current economic environment  earnings and stock price in  the corporation used a third party to evaluate goodwill for impairment several times in the methodology and results of these tests are further discussed at the goodwill section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the tests for impairment fair values are based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
the resulting estimated fair values could have a significant impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangibles and could result in impairment losses being recorded in future periods 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the effect of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationship with significant customers 
derivative instruments 
as part of the asset liability management program  the corporation will utilize  from time to time  interest rate floors  caps or swaps to reduce its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
these are derivative instruments  which are recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or other comprehensive income oci depending on the use of the derivative and whether the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for the hedge accounting is that the hedged relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in those cash flows that are attributable to the hedged risk  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
derivatives that qualify for the hedge accounting treatment are designated as either a hedge of the fair value of the recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
to date  the corporation has only entered into a cash flow hedge 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are reported in oci to the extent the hedge is effective 
the gains and losses on derivative instruments that are reported in oci are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which the results of operations are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
generally  net interest income is increased or decreased by amounts receivable or payable with respect to the derivatives  which qualify for hedge accounting 
at inception of the hedge  the corporation establishes the method it uses for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized currently in the consolidated statements of operations 
the corporation excludes the time value expiration of the hedge when measuring ineffectiveness

management ensures that appropriate methods to understand and underwrite risk are utilized 
commercial loans are individually underwritten and judgmentally risk rated 
they are periodically monitored and prompt corrective actions are taken on deteriorating loans 
retail loans are typically underwritten with statistical decision making tools and are managed throughout their life cycle on a portfolio basis 
in connection with recent economic developments  many financial institutions  including the corporation  have experienced unusual and significant declines in the performance of their loan portfolios in the values of real estate collateral supporting many loans declined  one result of which was increase charge offs during the year 
if recent trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  loan delinquencies and credit losses may also continue 
although the corporation believes it s underwriting and loan review procedures are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes  the corporation s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected in the event the quality of its loan portfolio deteriorates 
at december   non performing loans totaled  an increase of  from december  loans days past due other than non accrual and renegotiated loans decreased by  the amount of non accrual loans totaled  at december  non performing loans will increase or decrease going forward due to portfolio growth  routine problem loan recognition and resolution through collections  sales or charge offs 
the performance of any loan can be affected by external factors  such as economic conditions  or factors particular to a borrower  such as actions of a borrower s management 
the corporation s coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to non accrual loans increased from percent at december  to percent at december  charge offs only impact the coverage ratio to the extent a charge off is recorded in the same reporting period the charged off loan is moved from accruing to non accruing 
see additional information in the provision allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k

further impacting the development portfolio and associated charge offs  was the slowdown in commercial construction 
on certain projects  developers were unable to realize expected values for commercial development projects  which resulted in an increase in charge offs during charge offs stemming from commercial and industrial borrowers increased in related to several large commercial and industrial borrowers for reasons specific to individual borrower circumstances  commodity price changes and general economic conditions

the provision for loan losses in was  an increase of  from  in  reflecting an increase of  in net charge offs during the amount actually provided for loan losses in any period may be greater or less than net loan losses  based on management s judgment as to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the provision in any period is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio  and its judgment as to the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio 
the amount provided for loan losses and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are based on a continuous review of the loan portfolio  including an internally administered loan watch list and an independent loan review 
the evaluation takes into consideration identified credit problems  as well as the possibility of losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is critical to the corporation s financial results 
it requires management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain 
therefore  the allowance for loan losses  considering current factors at the time  including economic conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes  will increase or decrease as deemed necessary to ensure the allowance for loan losses remains adequate 
in addition  the allowance as a percentage of charge offs and nonperforming loans will change at different points in time based on credit performance  loan mix and collateral values 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  an increase of  from year end as a percent of loans  the allowance was percent at december  and percent at december  during  the allowance grew due to an increased level of specific reserves against impaired loans  an increase in the historical loss allocation factors applied against non criticized commercial loans  and an increase in the allocation for non impaired criticized loans 
specific reserves against impaired loans increased  from year end reflecting the impact of the protracted recessionary environment on commercial credits throughout loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral  including real property and business assets 
the fair value for impaired loans is measured based on the value of the collateral securing those loans and is determined using several methods 
the fair value of real estate is generally determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers 
the appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach 
updated as is and or liquidation value appraisals are obtained as individual circumstances and or market conditions warrant 
partially charged off loans measured for impairment based on their collateral value are generally not returned to performing status subsequent to receiving updated appraisals or restructure of the loan 
if an appraisal is not available  the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis 
fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically valued by using the financial information such as financial statements and aging reports provided by the borrower 
both appraised values and values based on borrower s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions 
loans deemed impaired according to guidance set forth in asc are evaluated during problem loan meetings held within each reporting period by a special assets management team 
loan collateral and customer financial information are reviewed and the level of impairment is assessed to determine appropriate and accurate reserve and or charge off amounts 
loans or portions of loans are charged off when they are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as an asset is not warranted 
it is the corporation s policy to recognize losses promptly to prevent overstatement of assets  earnings and capital

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision allowance for loan losses continued the following table summarizes specific reserves on impaired loans by loan category dollars in thousands december  december  loan category commercial commercial real estate residential real estate other loans and leases the historical loss allocation for non criticized loans is the product of the volume of loans within each call code classification and the historical loss factor for that particular classification 
the historical loss factors for non criticized loans are based upon actual loss experience within each loan classification and naturally adjusted upward in with the significant increase in net charges offs 
the reserve allocation for non criticized loans increased  from year end during  the historical reserve allocation for non impaired criticized commercial loans increased  from december  this component of the allowance is for credit losses  based on actual historical losses incurred from commercial loans with criticized risk grades 
the loss allocation for non impaired criticized loans is the product of the volume of loans within each non impaired criticized loan classification and the historical loss factor for that particular classification 
the historical loss factor is based on the most recent rolling four quarter average 
the resulting allocation is more reflective of existing conditions that may not be reflected in the historical allocation for non criticized loans 
criticized loans are grouped based on the risk grade assigned to the loan 
loans with a special mention grade are assigned a loss factor and loans with a classified grade but not impaired are assigned a separate loss factor 
the loss factors are based upon recent loss experience within each loan call code classification 
in  the loss factor computation for this allocation was enhanced with a segmented historical loss migration analysis of non impaired criticized risk grades to charge off 
given the rapid economic decline in and the resulting increases in both non impaired criticized loans and net charge offs  this allocation adjusted upward in to reflect the increased level of risk that management has associated with non impaired loans in the criticized risk category 
the following table summaries the historical reserve allocation by loan category dollars in thousands december  december  loan category commercial commercial real estate residential real estate installment ready reserve other loans and leases in addition to the specific reserves and historical loss components of the allowance  consideration is given to various environmental factors to help ensure that losses inherent in the portfolio are reflected in the allowance for loan losses 
the environmental component adjusts the historical loss allocations for commercial and consumer loans to reflect relevant current conditions that  in management s opinion  have an impact on loss recognition 
environmental factors that management reviews in the analysis include national and local economic trends and conditions  trends in growth in the loan portfolio and growth in higher risk areas  levels of  and trends in  delinquencies and non accruals  experience and depth of lending management and staff  adequacy of  and adherence to  lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  industry concentrations of credit  and adequacy of risk identification systems and controls through the internal loan review and internal audit processes 
each environmental factor receives an individual qualitative allocation that  in management s opinion  reflects losses inherent in the portfolio that are not reflected in the historical loss components of the allowance 
as mentioned in the critical accounting policies  the corporation s primary market areas for lending are central indiana and butler  franklin and hamilton counties in ohio 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the corporation s customers 
management feels the increase in the overall allowance for loan losses during compared to is reflective of the recessionary economic conditions during and is directionally consistent with current loan and loss trends 

table of contents part ii item and item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill during  the impact of deteriorating economic conditions has significantly impacted the banking industry and the financial results of the corporation 
as a result  while only required to test goodwill annually  the corporation decided to test its goodwill for impairment on three separate occasions during  most recently as of november the financial markets are currently reflecting significantly lower valuations for the stocks of financial institutions  when compared to historic valuation metrics  largely driven by both the constriction in available credit and the losses suffered related to residential mortgage markets 
additionally  many bank stocks with geographic exposure in certain markets  including indiana  have been depressed 
much of the depression also seems to be related to the need for certain financial institutions to obtain fresh capital to replace capital lost due to asset write downs 
the demand for this scarce fresh capital appears to be at least temporarily affecting the valuations placed on other banks with adequate capital reserves 
the tarp program is attempting to address this inadequate capital issue  however  the markets view tarp as very temporary 
the corporation s stock activity  as well as the price  has been adversely impacted by the economic conditions affecting the banking industry in management has concluded that trading value of the stock price is not indicative or reflective of fair value per asc fair value for the following reasons management believes that its addition of million of preferred stock issued through the treasury s capital purchase program on february  and the corresponding registration of a million universal mixed shelf registration filed on march   have unreasonably depressed the corporation s stock price due to the market s anticipation of a common stock offering as the exclusive strategy to repay the funds 
the approximate doubling of short sale positions of the corporation s stock from the date of the two referenced announcements to year end are reflective of the market s anticipation of a capital raise and have added to the downward pressure on the stock price 
the corporation s minimal free float driven by large index fund positions  coupled with meaningful long term retail holdings  has created unusual volatility in the stock price given modest fundamental changes in demand and appears to be impacting the price at year end as well 
lower trading volumes have also put downward pressure on the corporation s stock price 
the average daily volume of the corporation s stock for the fourth quarter of  as a percent of average outstanding shares  was more than percent less than the average daily volume during the first quarter of prior to the two announcement dates 
the two step goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized  if any 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure impairment loss  if any 
under the second step  the fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting 
if the implied goodwill value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the corporation used an independent  outside firm to help determine the fair value of the corporation for purposes of the first step of the impairment test 
the discounted earnings method an income approach as well as the guideline publicly traded company method and the transaction method both market approaches that apply market multiples to various financial metrics to derive value were used and weighted to form the conclusion of fair value 
the discounted earnings method was given primary weight in the fair value analysis 
the discounted earnings method was based primarily on management projections derived from expected balance sheet and income statement assumptions  based on current economic conditions  which show signs of stabilization from earlier in and possible improvement going forward  present value factors based on an implied market cost of equity  and  historic long term price to earnings multiples for comparable companies 
determining the corporation s fair value using the discounted earnings method involves a significant amount of judgment 
the methodology is largely based on unobservable level three inputs 
the test results are dependent upon attaining actual financial results consistent with the forecasts and assumptions used in the valuation model 
the discounted earnings method relied on a terminal price earnings p e multiple 
the p e multiple used to determine terminal value was notably lower than the historic p e multiple observed for the corporation  the peer group  and the nasdaq community banking index abaq 
based on the results of the step one analysis  the fair value exceeded the corporation s carrying value  therefore  it was concluded goodwill is not impaired 
additionally  a sensitivity analysis was performed on the discounted earnings methodology by testing a range of the following metrics implied market cost of equity  and historic long term price to earnings multiples for comparable companies 
based on the sensitivity testing  at the low end of the sensitivity test range for both metrics  fair value of the corporation exceeded its carrying value 
for reasons that include but are not limited to the aforementioned  management believes the corporation s recently traded stock price is not indicative of fair value 
liquidity liquidity management is the process by which the corporation ensures that adequate liquid funds are available for the holding company and its subsidiaries 
these funds are necessary in order to meet financial commitments on a timely basis 
these commitments include withdrawals by depositors  funding credit obligations to borrowers  paying dividends to stockholders  paying operating expenses  funding capital expenditures  and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the asset liability committee 
the corporation s liquidity is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the bank  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations and access to other funding sources 
liquidity of the bank is derived primarily from core deposit growth  principal payments received on loans  the sale and maturity of investment securities  net cash provided by operating activities  and access to other funding sources 
the most stable source of liability funded liquidity for both the long term and short term is deposit growth and retention in the core deposit base 
in addition  federal home loan bank fhlb advances are utilized as funding sources

securities classified as held to maturity and that are maturing in one year or less totaled  at december  in addition  other types of assets such as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  and loans and interest bearing deposits with other banks maturing within one year are sources of liquidity 
the corporation currently has a million credit facility with bank of america  na  as successor to lasalle bank national association  comprised of a a term loan in the principal amount of million the term loan and b a subordinated debenture in the principal amount of million the subordinated debt 
pursuant to the terms of the underlying loan agreement the loan agreement  the term loan and the subordinated debt each mature on february  the term loan is secured by a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the bank 
the loan agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and financial and negative covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan agreement 
at june   the corporation has failed to comply with a financial covenant in the loan agreement requiring the corporation to maintain  on an annualized basis  a minimum return on average total assets of at least 
on august   bank of america provided notice to the corporation that its noncompliance with the earnings covenant has caused an event of default under the loan agreement 
in addition  as of december   the corporation failed to meet the minimum return on average total assets covenant and a second financial covenant in the loan agreement requiring the corporation to maintain a certain asset quality ratio less than 
the loan agreement provides that upon an event of default as the result of the corporation s failure to comply with a financial covenant  bank of america may a declare the million outstanding principal amount of the term loan immediately due and payable  b exercise all of its rights and remedies at law  in equity and or pursuant to any or all collateral documents  including foreclosing on the collateral if payment of the term loan is not made in full  and c add a default rate of per annum to the term loan 
because the subordinated debt is treated as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  the loan agreement does not provide bank of america with any right of acceleration or other remedies with regard to the subordinated debt upon an event of default caused by the corporation s breach of a financial covenant 
to date  bank of america has chosen to apply the default rate  but not to accelerate the term loan based on the corporation s failure to meet these financial covenants 
in the normal course of business  the bank is a party to a number of other off balance sheet activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk asset liability management has been an important factor in the corporation s ability to record consistent earnings growth through periods of interest rate volatility and product deregulation 
management and the board of directors monitor the corporation s liquidity and interest sensitivity positions at regular meetings to review how changes in interest rates may affect earnings 
decisions regarding investment and the pricing of loan and deposit products are made after analysis of reports designed to measure liquidity  rate sensitivity  the corporation s exposure to changes in net interest income given various rate scenarios and the economic and competitive environments 
it is the objective of the corporation to monitor and manage risk exposure to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
it is the goal of the corporation s asset liability function to provide optimum and stable net interest income 
to accomplish this  management uses two asset liability tools 
gap interest rate sensitivity reports and net interest income simulation modeling are constructed  presented and monitored quarterly 
management believes that the corporation s liquidity and interest sensitivity position at december   remained adequate to meet the corporation s primary goal of achieving optimum interest margins while avoiding undue interest rate risk 
the following table presents the corporation s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  at december  dollars in thousands days days years beyond years total rate sensitive assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits investment securities loans federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing deposits securities sold under repurchase agreements federal home loan bank advances subordinated debentures  revolving credit lines and term loans total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap by period cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio at december  at december  the corporation had a cumulative negative gap of  in the one year horizon at december  or percent of total assets 
the corporation places its greatest credence in net interest income simulation modeling 
the above gap interest rate sensitivity report is believed by the corporation s management to have two major shortfalls 
the gap interest rate sensitivity report fails to precisely gauge how often an interest rate sensitive product reprices  nor is it able to measure the magnitude of potential future rate movements 
net interest income simulation modeling  or earnings at risk  measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements 
the corporation s asset liability process monitors simulated net interest income under three separate interest rate scenarios  base  rising and falling 
estimated net interest income for each scenario is calculated over a month horizon 
the immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario used in the model are presented below 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may introduce into the earnings of the corporation 
the base scenario is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the model  including assumptions related to future interest rates 
while the base sensitivity analysis incorporates management s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact will likely differ from that projected 
for mortgage related assets  the base simulation model captures the expected prepayment behavior under changing interest rate environments 
assumptions and methodologies regarding the interest rate or balance behavior of indeterminate maturity products  such as savings  money market  now and demand deposits  reflect management s best estimate of expected future behavior

net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s earnings 
it is a function of net interest margin and the level of average earning assets 
the following table presents the corporation s asset yields  interest expense  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets for the three year period ending in in  asset yields decreased basis points on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte and interest cost decreased basis points  resulting in a basis point decrease in the interest margin compared to growth in earning assets  primarily due to the lincoln acquisition on december   produced a positive volume variance of  fte  and a declining interest rate environment produced a negative rate variance of  resulting in an increase of  in net interest income 
in  asset yields decreased basis points on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte and interest cost decreased basis points  resulting in a basis point increase in the interest margin compared to the decrease in interest income and interest expense was primarily a result of seven federal funds rate decreases of approximately basis points by the federal open market committee during this period 
growth in earning assets produced a positive volume variance of  fte  and a declining interest rate environment produced a positive rate variance of  fte  resulting in an increase of  in net interest income

in addition  annualized amounts are computed utilizing a day basis 
income taxes income tax benefit totaled  for compared to expense of  for the effective tax rates for the periods ending december   and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the corporation s federal statutory income tax rate is percent and its state tax rate varies from to percent depending on the state in which the subsidiary company is domiciled 
the effective tax rate is lower than the blended effective statutory federal and state rates primarily due to the corporation s income on tax exempt securities and loans  income generated by the subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax  income tax credits generated from investments in affordable housing projects  tax exempt earnings from bank owned life insurance contracts and reduced state taxes  resulting from the effect of state income apportionment 
the reconciliation of federal statutory to actual tax expense is shown in note income tax  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
due to the loss experienced in  the corporation s tax asset  deferred and receivable increased from  at december  to  at december  the corporation anticipates receiving  by obtaining refunds of federal estimated tax payments and by carrying back the net operating loss to and tax years 
in addition  the corporation s net deferred tax asset has increased from  at december  to  at december  this change is primarily driven by significant increases in the timing differences associated with the deductibility of the provision for loan losses  other real estate owned expenses  and other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities 
the corporation has recorded a valuation allowance of  related to deferred state taxes as it does not anticipate having future state taxable income sufficient to fully utilize the deferred state tax asset 
this is primarily due to the corporation s current tax structure as noted above 
no valuation allowance has been recorded against the federal deferred tax asset as the corporation anticipates full utilization 
the strength of the corporation s earnings is the primary reason full utilization is expected 
as the credit environment stabilizes  the earnings power of the corporation will be evidenced by improved financial performance  in line with pre results 
inflation changing prices of goods  services and capital affect the financial position of every business enterprise 
the level of market interest rates and the price of funds loaned or borrowed fluctuate due to changes in the rate of inflation and various other factors  including government monetary policy 
fluctuating interest rates affect the corporation s net interest income and loan volume 
as the inflation rate increases  the purchasing power of the dollar decreases 
those holding fixed rate monetary assets incur a loss  while those holding fixed rate monetary liabilities enjoy a gain 
the nature of a financial holding company s operations is such that there will generally be an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities  and  thus  a financial holding company will tend to suffer from an increase in the rate of inflation and benefit from a decrease
