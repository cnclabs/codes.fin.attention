we market our products in approximately countries through a global distribution system that consists of a sales force of approximately  individuals who promote our products to orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
at the end of  we had approximately sales associates and independent sales distributors in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally  who were employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 
principal products 
we specialize in those products used by extremity focused surgeon specialists which include products for the reconstruction  trauma and arthroscopy markets  hip and knee reconstructive joint devices and biologic products 
our biologics sales encompass a broad portfolio of products designed to stimulate and augment the natural regenerative capabilities of the human body 
we also sell orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or biologics product lines 
our extremities product line includes products for both the foot and ankle and the upper extremity markets

our principal biologic products include the graftjacket line of soft tissue repair and containment membranes  the allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes  the pro dense injectable regenerative graft  the osteoset synthetic bone graft substitute  and the cancello pure wedge products 

table of contents our knee reconstruction products position us well in the areas of total knee reconstruction  revision replacement implants and limb preservation products 
our principal knee product is the advance knee system 
additionally  in april we launched our prophecy pre operative navigation guides for knee replacement  which enables surgeons to plan precise implant placement and alignment before a procedure in order to increase accuracy and decrease surgery time 
our hip joint reconstruction product portfolio provides offerings in the areas of bone conserving implants  total hip reconstruction  revision replacement implants and limb preservation 
our hip reconstruction products include the conserve family of products  the profemur family of hip stems  the dynasty acetabular cup system  the anca fit hip system  the perfecta hip system  and the lineage acetabular system 
significant business developments 
net sales grew in  totaling million  compared to million in our extremity product line contributed significantly to our performance in  achieving a growth rate 
additionally  our hip and knee product lines grew by and  respectively  which were partially offset by a decline of in our biologics product line 
our domestic extremity business experienced year over year growth from to totaling  as a result of the continued success of our charlotte foot and ankle system and our darco plating systems  as well as product sales from our acquisitions of the inbone total ankle system  and the rayhack osteotomy system 
we anticipate that growth within our domestic extremities business will continue to increase  as sales of our charlotte  darco  inbone and rayhack products continue to increase and as we continue to expand our extremity product offerings 
our international sales increased by during as compared to this increase was driven by growth in our asian markets and certain european markets  offset by continued declines in france  lower sales to our stocking distributor in turkey and a million unfavorable currency impact compared to our net income increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the million valuation allowance recorded in associated with our french net operating losses nols 
opportunities and challenges 
our results of operations can be substantially affected not only by global economic conditions  but also by local operating and economic conditions  which can vary substantially by market 
unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may result in actions that adversely affect our margins  constrain our operating flexibility  or result in charges which are unusual or non recurring 
the current state of the global economy has negatively impacted industry growth rates in both domestic and international markets during  and we are unable to predict when these markets will return to historical rates of growth 
in our domestic markets  we expect that an expansion of our sales force and product offerings will favorably impact our extremities and biologics businesses in however  we continue to expect that our domestic hip and knee business will continue to be unfavorably impacted by the economic downturn  and we therefore expect these businesses to grow slightly less than the market growth rates in the latter part of during  we expect a relatively stable pricing environment internationally 
given that  combined with the anticipated impact of our new australian subsidiary  as well as the annualization of the lower levels of revenues from our international stocking distributor in turkey  we anticipate moderate levels of sales growth in our international business 
this  however  could be impacted by foreign currency translation due to strengthening of the us dollar as compared with currencies such as the euro 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and 
table of contents innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the united states food and drug administration fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and has recently experienced increased pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joints 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
in december  we received a subpoena from the us attorney s office for the district of new jersey requesting certain documents related to consulting agreements with orthopaedic surgeons 
this subpoena was served shortly after several of our knee and hip competitors agreed to resolutions with the us department of justice doj after being subjects of investigation involving the same subject matter 
we continue to cooperate fully with the investigation by the doj  and we anticipate that we may continue to incur significant expenses related to this inquiry 
in june  we received a letter from the us securities and exchange commission sec informing us that it is conducting an informal investigation regarding potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry 
we understand that several other medical device companies have received similar letters 
we are cooperating fully with the sec inquiry 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in risk factors 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended december  change hip products knee products extremity products biologics products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart net sales 
our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in each year and a increase in over our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  principally resulting from the performance of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar 
the unfavorable currency impact  continued declines in france  and a reduction in sales to our stocking distributor in turkey were offset by an increase in international sales due to continued growth in our asian markets  primarily within our hip product lines  as well as certain of our european markets 
our net sales growth in by product line was led by our extremities product line  which increased over  while our hip and knee businesses increased and  respectively  and our biologic products declined 
our extremity product net sales increased to million in  representing growth of over our domestic extremity product net sales increased  primarily resulting from the continued success of our charlotte foot and ankle system and our darco plating systems  as well as sales related to our inbone and rayhack products  which were acquired in april and september  respectively 
international extremity sales growth in our european markets and canada was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of  compared to our hip product net sales totaled million in  representing a increase over this increase was driven by increased sales of our profemur hip system  as well as higher levels of sales of our dynasty acetabular cup system  which was launched during the second quarter of domestic hip sales were relatively flat in compared to with growth of year over year 
our international hip business increased in by over primarily due to growth in our asian markets 
international hip sales included a  favorable currency impact compared to net sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of over year over year growth in our advance knee systems  primarily in our international markets  totaled  which was partially offset by declines across our other  more mature knee product offerings 
additionally  our international knee sales include an unfavorable currency impact of  compared to 
table of contents net sales of our biologic products totaled million in  which represents a decrease as compared to our domestic net sales of biologics decreased from  resulting from lower levels of sales of our allomatrix product line  partially offset by increased sales of our pro dense injectable regenerative graft and our graftjacket tissue repair products 
our international net sales of biologics decreased over prior year  primarily the result of the suspension of biologics distribution in belgium and turkey due to changes in reimbursement rates and a  unfavorable currency impact 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in this increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of excess and obsolete inventory provisions  increased raw material and other manufacturing costs  and unfavorable currency exchange rates 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses  levels of production volume and currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled and in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense for included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales  million of costs  primarily legal fees  associated with us government inquiries of net sales  and a million provision for potential losses associated with a trade receivable of net sales 
during  selling  general and administrative expense included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales  million of costs  primarily legal fees  associated with us government inquiries of net sales  and million of expense due to an unfavorable appellate court decision of net sales 
the remaining expenses declined by point as a percentage of net sales as a result of cost savings initiatives  primarily in our european subsidiaries  and lower levels of cash incentive compensation  partially offset by increased expenses associated with global compliance efforts 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales and requires us to expand our infrastructure 
further  in the near term  we anticipate that these expenses may increase as a percentage of net sales as we make strategic investments to grow our business  as we continue to incur expenses associated with the us government inquiries  which we believe may continue to be significant  and as our spending related to the global compliance requirements of our industry increases 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
our research and development expense included non cash  stock based compensation expense of million of net sales in  compared to million of net sales in the remaining expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of net sales as increased spending on product development grew at the same rates as sales 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures may increase as a percentage of net sales and will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives and clinical studies to support regulatory approvals and provide expanded proof of the efficacy of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
charges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  as compared to million in the increase is attributable to a full year of amortization during for intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents acquired in process research and development iprd 
during  upon our acquisition of inbone technologies  inc  we immediately recognized as expense million in costs representing the estimated fair value of acquired iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the fair value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from this project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the resulting net cash flows from the project were based on our management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes from the project 
a summary of the estimates used to calculate the net cash flows for the project is as follows year net cash discount rate including acquired in flows expected to factor to account for iprd in project begin uncertainty of success thousands inbone calcaneal stem implant the inbone calcaneal stem implant calcaneal stem is an implant device designed to attach on the inbone talar dome and achieve bone implant stability by engaging the inside of the talar bone spanning into the calcaneal bone after the two bones have been stabilized together 
we expect this device to bring increased sales to the existing inbone total ankle system 
the product is complete  but it has not yet received all the necessary fda clearances to bring the product into a commercially viable product 
prior to our acquisition  inbone filed a k premarket notification for the calcaneal stem and had received questions from the fda 
subsequent to the acquisition  we received additional questions from the fda 
due to the complexity of these additional questions and the fda s requirement for clinical data in support of the safety and efficacy of the calcaneal stem  we are currently working on the development of an investigational device exemption protocol that will subsequently support a premarket approval pma filing for market approval 
this protocol will require two year follow ups of the enrolled patients  therefore market approval is not expected prior to the end of we do not believe that this additional work will result in a material amount of expenses 
we are continuously monitoring our research and development projects 
we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of acquired iprd represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the acquired iprd 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense income  net  consists of interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  primarily from our million of convertible senior notes due issued in november  our capital lease agreements  and certain of our factoring agreements 
this was partially offset by interest income of million and million during and  respectively  generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the decline in interest income is due to the overall decline in interest rates on our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities during the amounts of interest income we realize in and beyond are subject to variability  dependent upon both the rate of invested returns we realize and the amount of excess cash balances on hand 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net  totaled million of expense during compared to million of income during during  we recognized million of expense related to the write off of the cta balances for certain subsidiaries that have been substantially liquidated 
during  we recognized  of deferred gain associated with the disposition of our adcon gel assets 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for and was and respectively 
in  we reduced our valuation allowance as a result of a change in estimate regarding the jurisdiction where certain deductions would be recognized for tax purposes  which decreased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in  we recognized a tax provision of million to adjust our valuation allowance  primarily to record a valuation allowance against all of our remaining deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in france  which increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales net sales cost of sales cost of sales restructuring gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income interest expense income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended december  change hip products knee products extremity products biologics products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart net sales 
our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in each year and a increase over our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  principally resulting from the performance of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar 
the remaining increase in international sales is attributable to growth in our asian and european markets  primarily within our hip and knee product lines 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across all four of our principal product lines 
for  we experienced growth of    and in our extremity  hip  knee  and biologics  respectively 
during  our extremity sales growth was attributable primarily to the continued success of our charlotte foot and ankle system and increased sales of our darco plating systems  as well as sales of our inbone products acquired during the second quarter of the increase in our hip product sales was driven by increased sales of our profemur hip system  our conserve family of products  our dynasty acetabular cup system and sales of revision hip stems introduced during the second quarter sales of our knee products increased in compared to the prior year as a result of growth in our advance knee systems  which was partially offset by declines across our other  more mature knee product offerings 
the growth of our biologics business in was primarily attributable to increased sales of our pro dense injectable regenerative graft  our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes and our cancellopure wedge products 
cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in this increase was primarily attributable to unfavorable shifts in our geographic and product line sales mix and increased raw material and other manufacturing costs  which were partially offset by lower levels of non cash stock based compensation expense 
our cost of sales included percentage points and percentage points of non cash  stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
cost of sales restructuring 
in  we recorded million  of net sales  of charges associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility in toulon  france for inventory write offs and manufacturing costs incurred during a period of abnormal production capacity which were expensed as period costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc section  inventory 

table of contents operating expenses 
our total operating expenses decreased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges 
the decrease in operating expenses was attributed primarily to decreased restructuring expenses  as well as lower levels of expenses due to our restructuring efforts in toulon  france  lower levels of professional fees  decreased stock based compensation  and the leveraging of fixed administrative fees  all of which were partially offset by costs associated with the us government inquiries and the charge for in process research and development 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rate includes a tax provision of million to adjust our valuation allowance  primarily to record a valuation allowance against all of our remaining deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in france  which increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our products are used in elective procedures  which generally decline during the summer months  typically resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this three day event  we display our most recent and innovative products to these surgeons 
restructuring toulon  france in  we announced our plans to close our facilities in toulon  france 
this announcement came after a thorough evaluation in which we determined that we had excess manufacturing capacity and redundant distribution and administrative resources that would be best eliminated through the closure of this facility 
the majority of our restructuring activities were complete by the end of  with production now conducted solely in our existing manufacturing facility in arlington  tennessee and the distribution activities being carried out from our european headquarters in amsterdam  the netherlands 
we have estimated that total pre tax restructuring charges will be approximately million to million  of which we have recognized million through december  we anticipate that recording the remaining million to million of restructuring expenses could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period incurred  however we do not expect that the restructuring will have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
we began realizing the benefits from this restructuring within selling  general and administrative expenses in while we began realizing the benefits from this restructuring within cost of sales in  unfavorable currency exchange rates and increased raw material and other manufacturing costs have offset some of those benefits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our restructuring charges 
creteil  france in october  we announced plans to close our distribution and finance support office in creteil  france  to migrate all relevant french distribution and support functions into our european organization based out of our european headquarters in amsterdam  the netherlands 
direct sales in france will continue and will be serviced by independent sales agents 
we have estimated that total pre tax restructuring charges will be approximately million to million  of which we have recognized million through december  we anticipate that recording the remaining restructuring expenses may have a material impact on our 
table of contents results of operations in the period incurred  however we do not expect that this restructuring will have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
we will realize the benefits from this restructuring within selling  general and administrative expenses beginning in see note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our restructuring charges 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain liquidity measures in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital line of credit availability during the first quarter of  we liquidated our investments in auction rate securities into cash equivalents 
for the remainder of and throughout  we invested in treasury bills  government bonds  agency bonds and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than months 
we have classified these marketable securities as available for sale 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  as compared to cash used by operating activities of million in and cash provided by operating activities of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to changes in working capital  as inventory balances decreased significantly due to a focus on inventory management during  and accounts receivable decreased as the result of diligent collection efforts  which were partially offset by the liquidation of our investments in auction rate securities that were classified as trading securities 
in compared to  increased profitability was offset by changes in working capital 
accounts receivable increased due to higher levels of sales in international markets that typically have longer collection terms 
inventories increased due to recent acquisitions and distribution agreements  and to support higher levels of sales 
finally  in  our accrued expenses increased significantly  primarily associated with restructuring charges 
investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to is attributable to lower levels of expenditures related to the expansion of our arlington  tennessee facilities million in and million in as well as lower levels of investments in surgical instrumentation related to acquired and new products 
our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted principally of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in for routine capital expenditures  as well as approximately million for the continued expansion of facilities in arlington  tennessee 
financing activities 
during  proceeds of  were generated from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options granted under our stock based compensation plans and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
these proceeds were offset by  in principal payments related to our long term capital lease obligations 
in early  we terminated certain accounts receivable factoring agreements 
while these factoring agreements were active  the cash proceeds  net of the amount of factored receivables collected  were reflected 
table of contents as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the proceeds received under these agreements during and were million and million  respectively 
these proceeds were offset by payments for factored receivables collected of million and million in and  respectively 
we recorded obligations of  for the amount of receivables factored under these agreements as of december   which are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of  and we will make scheduled interest payments under our convertible senior notes of million 
on december   our revolving credit facility had availability of million  which can be increased by up to an additional million at our request and subject to the agreement of the lenders 
we currently have no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at the sum of an annual base rate plus an applicable annual rate that ranges from to depending on the type of loan and our consolidated leverage ratio  with a current annual base rate of 
the term of the credit facility extends through june  during  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds of million 
the notes require us to pay interest semiannually at an annual rate of 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  which represents a conversion price of per share 
we will make scheduled interest payments in related to the notes totaling million 
contractual cash obligations 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by periods total after amounts reflected in consolidated balance sheet capital lease obligations convertible senior notes contingent consideration amounts not reflected in consolidated balance sheet operating leases interest on convertible senior notes purchase obligations royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest 
represents long term debt payment provided holders of the convertible senior notes due do not exercise the option to convert each  note into shares of our common stock 
our convertible senior notes are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
represents interest on convertible senior notes due payable semiannually with an annual interest rate of 
the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements  which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the 
table of contents minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments under non cancelable contracts with consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
our contingent consideration obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum guaranteed payments related to our acquisition of inbone technologies  inc additionally  cash payments of up to million may be made related to this and certain other of our acquisitions based upon future financial and operational performance of the acquired assets 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our domestic sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales 
a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to royalties earned based on product sales 
additionally  as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 
certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds totaling million 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balance of million and our existing available credit line of million will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million and meet our contractual cash obligations in 
table of contents critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and surgery centers  and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of employee and independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals and surgery centers when they take title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately  and  of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience credit losses on our accounts receivable and accordingly  we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  we have 
table of contents experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international stocking distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continued collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically appropriate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately not collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly  which would necessitate additional allowances in future periods 
our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  at december  and  respectively  which includes a million provision recorded in for potential losses related to the trade receivable balance of our stocking distributor in turkey 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out fifo basis or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  in  we recorded charges of million associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility in toulon  france  for inventory write offs and manufacturing costs incurred during a period of abnormal production capacity 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the fasb asc section  property  plant and equipment fasb asc 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an 
table of contents asset  future depreciation and amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  if we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on the asset s fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities  and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately million and  at december  and  respectively 
we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss can be developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance balances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carryforward of certain tax basis net operating losses and general business tax credits 
during the year ended december   we recognized a tax provision of million to adjust our valuation allowance  primarily to record a valuation allowance against all of our remaining deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in france 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january   which requires the tax effects of an income tax position to be recognized only if they are more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  income taxes 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions  and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we calculate the grant date fair value of non vested shares as the closing sales price on the trading day immediately prior to the grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of these stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected life of options by calculating the average of the vesting period and the contractual term of the option  as allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we estimate the expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  such stock based compensation expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
a change in assumptions may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our stock based compensation disclosures 
purchase accounting 
we accounted for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is 
table of contents allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows associated with the asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with standard valuation methods 
the estimates of future cash flows include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for acquired businesses 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  business combinations fasb asc 
under this standard  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value 
legal fees and other transaction related costs will be expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
fasb asc also requires  among other things  acquirers to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition 
restructuring charges 
we evaluate impairment issues for long lived assets under the provisions of fasb asc we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc section  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time termination benefit arrangements and other costs associated with exit activities are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc section  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we have estimated the expense for our restructuring initiative by accumulating detailed estimates of costs  including the estimated costs of employee severance and related termination benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases and any other qualifying exit costs 
such costs represent management s best estimates  which are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the interest rates associated with our invested cash balances 
on december   we have invested short term cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
based on this level of investment  a decrease of in interest rates would have a negative annual impact of  to our interest income 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during each of the years ended december  and  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure 
for sales not denominated in us dollars  an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and our competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries  which are denominated in the euro  from japan  which are denominated in the japanese yen  from the united kingdom  which are denominated in the british pound  and from canada  which are denominated in the canadian dollar 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  the yen  the british pound  and the canadian dollar 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the yen  the us dollar and the british pound  and the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
