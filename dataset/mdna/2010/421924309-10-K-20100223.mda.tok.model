table of contents 
index to financial statements competitive strengths as the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services and with our business focused primarily on those services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the following ways people 
we believe our  employees  in particular our highly skilled clinical staff  share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding rehabilitative care to patients across the country 
because of the value and importance we attribute to our clinical staff  we work very hard to reduce our turnover rates 
we also undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff maintains the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality rehabilitative care in a cost effective manner 
quality 
our hospitals provide a broad base of clinical experience from which we have developed clinical best practices and protocols 
we believe these clinical best practices and protocols help ensure the delivery of consistently high quality rehabilitative healthcare services across all of our hospitals 
efficiency and cost effectiveness 
our size helps us provide inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services on a cost effective basis 
specifically  because of our large number of inpatient hospitals  we can utilize proven staffing models and take advantage of certain supply chain efficiencies 
we have also developed a program called teamworks  which is an operations focused initiative using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a wide spectrum of operational areas 
technology 
as a market leader in inpatient rehabilitation  we have devoted substantial effort and expertise to leveraging rehabilitative technology 
for example  we have developed an innovative therapeutic device called the autoambulator  which can help advance the rehabilitative process for patients who experience difficulty walking 
technology instituted in our facilities allows us to effectively treat patients with a wide variety of significant physical disabilities 
patients and demographic trends demographic trends  such as population aging  will affect long term growth in healthcare spending 
while we treat patients of all ages  most of our patients are persons and older 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services will increase as the us population ages and life expectancies increase 
in addition  the number of medicare compliant patients ie  a patient who qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under medicare rules is expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths in and focus on inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike many of our competitors that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
strategy as a result of the significant credit market disruptions in late and the continuing market volatility throughout  we focused our strategy on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing our long term debt and improving our leverage  providing high quality  cost effective care  enhancing the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  sustaining discharge growth and increasing market share  and expanding our inpatient rehabilitation business with disciplined development 
during  we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million 
our progress improving our leverage and liquidity was confirmed when moody s upgraded our corporate credit rating to b  allowing the spread on our term loan to be reduced by basis points effective june  standard and poor s moved our outlook to positive from stable 
in addition to our debt reduction  we improved our overall debt 
table of contents 
index to financial statements profile by refinancing senior notes  extending a portion of our term loan  and amending other terms of our credit agreement 
on october   we amended our credit agreement to  among other things convert million of outstanding term loans into a new class of term loans with an extension of the maturity to september and a basis point step up in interest rate  permit future extensions of all or a portion of the term loans  revolving credit facility  and synthetic letter of credit commitments  subject to certain restrictions  permit issuance of senior notes  both secured  on a pari passu basis with indebtedness incurred under our credit agreement  and unsecured  and make other changes  including increasing certain baskets under the restrictive covenants  that are more consistent with our financial position 
on december   we completed a refinancing transaction in which we issued million of senior notes due and tendered for and redeemed the remaining million of our outstanding floating rate senior notes due the refinancing transaction reduced debt  extended debt maturities  and reduced floating interest rate exposure 
we do not face near term refinancing risk

in addition  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation unit in altoona  pennsylvania through a newly formed joint venture and relocated its operations to one of our hospitals and acquired a bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in little rock  arkansas through an existing joint venture in which we participate 
for  we will continue to focus on providing high quality  cost effective care and finding efficiencies in our cost structure at both the corporate and operational levels 
we intend to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce leverage through improved operational performance 
our growth strategy in will focus on organic growth  including increasing the bed capacity in our hospitals and pursuing disciplined development opportunities in new markets through  for example  strategic joint ventures and potential acquisitions of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals or units 
we believe the changes made to our credit agreement and debt profile in the fourth quarter of provide us with greater flexibility to execute our business plan  including the growth component 
for additional discussion of our strategy and business outlook  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were full time employees 
we are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages  hours  benefits  and other terms and conditions relating to employment 
except for approximately employees at one inpatient rehabilitation hospital about of that hospital s workforce  none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we are not aware of any current activities to organize our employees at other hospitals 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
like most healthcare providers  our labor costs are rising faster than the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements general inflation rate 
in some markets  the lack of availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers 
to address this challenge  we will continue to focus on improving our retention  recruiting  compensation programs  and productivity 
the shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel  including physical therapists  may require us to increase utilization of more expensive temporary personnel 
competition the inpatient rehabilitation industry is highly fragmented  and we have no single  similar direct competitor 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units  many of which are within acute care hospitals  and skilled nursing facilities in the markets we serve 
our ltchs compete with other ltchs or  in some cases  rehabilitation hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the markets we serve 
for a list of our markets by state  see the table in item  properties 
several smaller privately held companies compete with us primarily in select geographic markets in texas and the west 
in addition  there are public companies that own primarily ltchs but also own a small number of inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
there is one public company that manages the operations of inpatient rehabilitation facilities and ltchs as part of its business model 
because of the attractiveness of the industry  other providers of post acute care services may also become competitors in the future 
for example  over the past few years  the number of nursing homes marketing themselves as rehabilitation providers has increased 
the competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided  the treatment outcomes achieved  and the presence of physician owned providers 
additionally  for a discussion regarding the effects of certificate of need requirements on competition in some states  see the regulation certificates of need section below 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses  therapists  and other clinical personnel for our hospitals 
we compete for these professionals with other healthcare companies  hospitals  and potential clients and partners 
in addition  physicians and others have opened inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in direct competition with us  particularly in states in which a certificate of need is not required to build a hospital  which has occasionally made it more difficult and expensive to hire the necessary personnel for our hospitals in those markets 
healthcare reform the healthcare industry always has been a highly regulated industry  and the inpatient rehabilitation segment is no exception 
successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality care and have the capabilities to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment 
we believe we have the necessary capabilities scale  infrastructure  and management to adapt and succeed in a highly regulated industry  and we have a proven track record of being able to do so 
president obama has identified healthcare reform as a major domestic priority  and congress is devoting considerable effort to drafting healthcare reform legislation 
at the time of this writing  no specific healthcare reform legislation has been adopted  but the us senate and house of representatives have passed healthcare reform bills 
the terms of those bills differ significantly  and we are unable to predict what form final legislation will take  if enacted 
we have been  and will continue to be  actively engaged in the legislative process to ensure that any healthcare reform adopted promotes our goals of high quality  cost effective care 
many issues are being discussed within the context of healthcare reform  several of which could have an impact on our business 
the three issues with the greatest potential impact are reducing annual adjustments to medicare payment rates  or market basket updates  to providers  combining  or bundling  acute care hospital and post acute medicare reimbursement at some point in the future  and creating an independent medicare advisory board 
with respect to future reductions to market basket updates  and as previously noted  while no specific healthcare legislation has been adopted at this time  the healthcare reform bills that have been passed by both the us senate and house include reductions to market basket updates 
while we cannot be certain of the net effect of these potential market basket reductions  or if they will be enacted  we will be working with other providers  as well as other interested parties  to help ensure they do not compromise our ability to provide high quality services to the patients we serve 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the probability of enacting a bundled payment system is difficult to predict at this time 
the major healthcare reform bills being contemplated currently by congress include provisions to examine the feasibility of bundling  including the potential for a voluntary bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies 
we will continue to work with the acute hospital and post acute care provider communities on this important issue 
there has also been discussion of establishing an independent medicare advisory board that would be charged with presenting proposals to congress to reduce medicare expenditures upon the occurrence of medicare expenditures exceeding a certain level 
at this point  it is difficult to determine whether an independent medicare advisory board will be enacted into law  and  if so  how it would function 
similar to the reform issues discussed above  we will continue to work with other providers  as well as other parties who have a vested interest  to help ensure they do not compromise our ability to provide high quality services to the patients we serve 
sources of revenues we receive payment for patient care services from the federal government primarily under the medicare program  managed care plans and private insurers  and  to a considerably lesser degree  state governments under their respective medicaid or similar programs and directly from patients 
revenues and receivables from medicare are significant to our operations 
in addition  we receive relatively small payments for non patient care activities from various sources 
the following table identifies the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in managed care and other discount plans in the table above  including private insurance companies  employers  health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and other managed care plans 
medicare  through its medicare advantage program  offers medicare eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in a managed care plan 
the medicare advantage revenues are also included in managed care and other discount plans in the table above 
patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  and other private insurance plans  hmos  or ppos but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles  copayments  or coinsurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles  copayments  and coinsurance has been increasing each year 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
medicare reimbursement medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons  and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicare  through statutes and regulations  establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare facilities and services  and  from time to time  these methodologies and rates can be modified by the united states congress or the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
in some instances  these modifications can have a substantial impact on existing healthcare providers 
in accordance with medicare laws and statutes  cms makes annual adjustments to medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems  including the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system the irf pps under what is commonly known as a market basket update 
each year  the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  an independent 
table of contents 
index to financial statements congressional agency that advises congress on issues affecting medicare  makes payment policy recommendations to congress for a variety of medicare payment systems including the irf pps 
however  congress is not obligated to adopt medpac recommendations  and  based on outcomes in previous years  there can be no assurance that congress will adopt medpac s recommendations in a given year 
in the case of the irf pps  unless congress changes the law  cms is required to adjust the payment rates based on a market basket index  known as the rehabilitation  psychiatric  and long term care hospital market basket 
the market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in covered services provided by rehabilitation hospitals and hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
the market basket uses data furnished by the bureau of labor statistics for price proxy purposes  primarily in three categories producer price indexes  consumer price indexes  and employment cost indexes 
the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act included an elimination of the irf pps market basket adjustment for the period from april  through september  causing a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of  or a medicare pricing roll back  which resulted in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs 
on august   cms published in the federal register the fiscal year notice of final rulemaking for the irf pps 
this rule contains medicare pricing changes as well as new coverage requirements  including requirements for preadmission screening  post admission evaluations  and individualized treatment planning that emphasize the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care 
the pricing changes are effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  and include a market basket update  which is the first market basket update we have received in months 
we have analyzed the other aspects of the cms pricing changes and believe the remaining pricing changes will have a neutral to slightly positive impact on our net operating revenues 
in addition  the new rules include supplemental documentation requirements  including submission of patient assessment data on medicare advantage patients 
the new coverage requirements under the rule apply to discharges occurring on or after january  prior to the new rule  our clinical and business models incorporated many of the new requirements  so these changes have not resulted in material modifications to the way we admit or treat patients 
we have undertaken efforts to educate and train our employees on compliance with these new requirements  including producing a comprehensive compliance guide 
although these new requirements have only been in effect for a short time  we believe we are in compliance with them 
if we experience unexpected difficulty in complying with the new coverage requirements  the corresponding claims for our services may be denied in whole or in part which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
currently  congress is considering legislation that includes reductions in market basket updates to the medicare payment rates 
see the healthcare reform section above 
we cannot predict the adjustments  if any  to medicare payment rates that congress or cms may make 
congress  medpac  and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings 
any downward adjustment to rates  or another pricing roll back  for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
on january   cms approved final rules that require healthcare providers to update and supplement diagnosis and procedure codes to the international classification of diseases th edition  effective october   and make related changes to the formats used for certain electronic transactions  effective january  at this time  we cannot predict how these changes will affect us 
a basic summary of current medicare reimbursement in our primary service areas follows inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under the irf pps 
as discussed above  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge under the irf pps based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
with the irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  cost effective providers 
over the last several years  changes in regulation governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created a challenging operating environment for inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on  and in some cases  reductions in  the levels of payments to healthcare providers 
for example  on may   cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an 
table of contents 
index to financial statements inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet its requirements would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
on december   the medicare act was signed  permanently setting the compliance threshold at instead of and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule 
the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive because it allowed patient volumes to stabilize 
in  increased patient volumes resulting  we believe  from both our focus on standardizing sales and marketing efforts and the fact that more patients now have access to our high quality  cost effective inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services offset the negative impact of the pricing roll back that expired september  although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent the most significant challenges to our business  our operations are also affected by coverage rules and determinations 
medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local level  that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
the new cms coverage rules discussed above and effective as of january  require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a qualified rehabilitation physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team meeting prescribed by the rules 
the interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care 
qualified personnel must provide required rehabilitation nursing  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech language pathology  social services  psychological services  and prosthetic and orthotic services 
cms has also noted that it is considering specific standards governing the use of group therapies 
for individual claims  medicare contractors make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity which can represent more restrictive interpretations of the cms coverage rules 
we cannot predict how these new cms coverage rules or any new local coverage determinations will affect us 
on december   the medicare modernization act of authorized cms to conduct a demonstration program known as the medicare recovery audit contractor rac program 
this demonstration was first initiated in three states california  florida  and new york and authorizes cms to contract with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits 
these audits are in addition to those conducted by existing medicare contractors  and the contracted racs are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered 
on december   the tax relief health care act of directed cms to expand the rac program to the rest of the country by the new racs were announced on october   and the racs began their audit processes in late for providers in general 
among other changes in the permanent program  the new racs will receive claims data directly from medicare contractors on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid  beginning with claims filed on or after october  we have undertaken significant efforts through training and education to ensure compliance with coding and coverage rules 
these rac audits will initially focus on coding errors 
for several years  as part of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the hhs oig  we have obtained independent third party reviews of our coding accuracy 
despite our belief that our coding of patients is accurate  these rac audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by medicare in some instances  require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments  and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid 
we cannot predict when or how this new program will affect us 
outpatient services 
our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under the physician fee schedule 
in late  congress provided for a two month update to the calendar year physician fee schedule effective for january  through february  if congress does not again act to set aside implementation of previously adopted reductions to the physician fee schedule  the outpatient payment formula will decrease by approximately beginning march  we cannot predict what  if any  action congress will take on the physician fee schedule  and we cannot predict how future congressional action or inaction on the physician fee schedule will affect us 
long term acute care hospitals 
ltchs provide medical treatment to patients with chronic diseases and or complex medical conditions 
in order for a hospital to qualify as an ltch  medicare patients discharged 
table of contents 
index to financial statements from the hospital in any given cost reporting year must have an average length of stay in excess of days  among other requirements 
ltchs are currently reimbursed under a prospective payment system ltch pps pursuant to which medicare classifies patients into distinct medicare severity diagnosis related groups ms ltc drgs based upon specific clinical characteristics and expected resource needs 
there are adjustments to the medicare payments based on high cost outliers  short stay outliers  and other factors 
a hospital that fails to qualify as an ltch will be reimbursed at what is generally a lower rate under the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
the medicare act  as amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  mandates significantly expanded medical necessity reviews for ltch patients but provides regulatory relief to ltchs to ensure continued access to current long term acute care hospital services  while also imposing a moratorium on the development of new long term acute care hospitals during this period 
in particular  the medicare act  as amended  prevented cms from implementing its new payment reduction provision for short stay outlier cases and its extension of the referral limitation threshold to all ltchs  including freestanding ltchs like ours  that was included in the final cms rule for rate year the postponement of the short stay outlier reductions and the referral limitation threshold as it applies to five of our six freestanding ltchs expires june   and march  for the other  unless congress acts again 
see regulation hospital within hospital rules section below for a further discussion of this rule 
on august   cms published in the federal register final regulations that updated payment rates under the ltch pps for rate year  which are effective for discharges occurring on or after october  through september  and include a market basket update less an adjustment of to account for changes in documentation and coding practices 
these final regulations also included an interim final rule implementing provisions of the arra discussed above and making changes to the table of ms ltc drg relative weights and other payment provisions under the ltch pps 
these final regulations did not materially impact our net operating revenues in  nor is it expected to materially impact our net operating revenues 
medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford healthcare 
as the medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of cms in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines  there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state 
many states have experienced shortfalls in their medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates 
additionally  certain states control medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services 
continuing downward pressure on medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our net operating revenues 
however  for the year ended december   medicaid payments represented only of our consolidated net operating revenues 
managed care and other discount plans all of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of healthcare services  including medicare advantage  managed care plans  private insurance companies  and third party administrators 
for further discussion of medicare advantage  or managed medicare  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations 
managed care contracts typically have terms of between one and three years  although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year with pre defined rate increases unless a party elects to terminate the contract 
while some of our contracts provide for annual rate increases of three to five percent  we cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases 
our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided 
cost reports because of our participation in medicare  medicaid  and certain bcbs plans  we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs  and expenses associated with the services provided by our inpatient hospitals to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 

table of contents 
index to financial statements annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due healthsouth under these reimbursement programs 
these audits are used for determining if any under or over payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years 
the majority of our revenues are derived from prospective payment system payments  and even if we amend previously filed cost reports we do not expect the impact of those amendments to materially affect our results of operations 
regulation the healthcare industry in general is subject to significant federal  state  and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources  regulating the use of our properties  and controlling our growth 
most of our facilities provide the medical  nursing  therapy  and ancillary services required to comply with local  state  and federal regulations  as well as accreditation standards of the joint commission formerly known as the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and  for some facilities  the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities 
we maintain a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
the program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations 
as part of the compliance program  we provide annual compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor  or a toll free telephone hotline 
licensure and certification healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  maintenance of adequate records  fire prevention  and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and non governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure 
all of our inpatient hospitals are currently required to be licensed 
in addition  hospitals must be certified by cms to participate in the medicare program and generally must be certified by medicaid state agencies to participate in medicaid programs 
all of our inpatient hospitals participate in or are awaiting the assignment of a provider number to participate in the medicare program 
our medicare certified hospitals undergo periodic on site surveys in order to maintain their certification 
failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals ineligible for medicare or medicaid reimbursement 
in addition  medicare or medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant facilities or otherwise impose sanctions on noncompliant facilities 
non governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if a facility loses its medicare or medicaid certification 
we have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities  however  given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations  there can be no assurance that medicare  medicaid  or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance 
certificates of need in some states where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory agencies under a certificate of need or con law 
as of december   approximately of our licensed beds are located in states that have con laws 
con laws often require a reviewing agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services 
these laws generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs  if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds 
in addition  con laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity commitments as a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements condition for approving a certificate of need 
any time a certificate of need is required  we must obtain it before acquiring  opening  reclassifying  or expanding a healthcare facility or starting a new healthcare program 
we potentially face opposition any time we initiate a certificate of need project or seek to acquire an existing facility or certificate of need 
this opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed con project 
opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds or hospitals in given markets 
the necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition  including in markets where we hold a con and a competitor is seeking an approval 
we have generally been successful in obtaining cons or similar approvals when required  although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future 
false claims the federal false claims act prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the united states government  and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to  per claim 
in addition  the false claims act allows private persons  known as relators  to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints 
because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations  a billing error or cost reporting error could result in significant civil or criminal penalties under the false claims act 
many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services 
for additional discussion  see note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
relationships with physicians and other providers anti kickback law 
various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services  including management or service contracts and investment relationships 
among the most important of these restrictions is a federal criminal law prohibiting the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the medicare or medicaid programs the anti kickback law 
in addition to federal criminal sanctions  including penalties of up to  for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims  violators of the anti kickback law may be subject to exclusion from the medicare and or medicaid programs 
in  the hhs oig issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the anti kickback law 
those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that  if fully complied with  assure participants in the particular arrangement that the hhs oig will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the anti kickback law or as the basis for an exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions 
failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the anti kickback law  but the hhs oig has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny 
a violation  or even the assertion of  a violation of the anti kickback law by us or one or more of our partnerships could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
some of our rehabilitation hospitals are owned through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals 
in addition  we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers  including management or service contracts 
even though some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not meet all of the regulatory requirements to fall within the protection offered by a relevant safe harbor  we do not believe we engage in activities that violate the anti kickback law 
however  there can be no assurance such violations may not be asserted in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful 
for example  we have entered into agreements to manage many of our hospitals that are owned by partnerships 
most of these agreements incorporate a percentage based management fee 
although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts  this safe harbor requires  among other things  the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance 
because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues  the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement 
however  we believe 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the anti kickback law 
physician self referral law 
the federal law commonly known as the stark law and cms regulations promulgated under the stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for designated health services including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  physical therapy  occupational therapy  or radiology services  to an entity in which the physician or an immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship  subject to certain exceptions 
the stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing for those referred services 
violators of the stark statute and regulations may be subject to recoupments  civil monetary sanctions up to  for each violation and assessments equal to three times the value of each prohibited service and exclusion from any federal  state  or other governmental healthcare programs 
the statute also provides a penalty of up to  for a circumvention scheme 
there are statutory exceptions to the stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including personal services contracts and leases 
however  in order to be afforded protection by a stark law exception  the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception 
cms has issued several phases of final regulations implementing the stark law 
while these regulations help clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the stark law  it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes 
recent changes to the regulations implementing the stark law further restrict the types of arrangements that facilities and physicians may enter  including additional restrictions on certain leases  percentage compensation arrangements  and agreements under which a hospital purchases services under arrangements 
we may be required to restructure or unwind some of our arrangements because of these changes 
because many of these laws and their implementing regulations are relatively new  we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
we attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the stark law  but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex 
accordingly  we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the stark law 
additionally  no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the stark law  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships  or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships  might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular healthsouth hospitals 
even the assertion of a violation could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
hipaa also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by medicare beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services 
in addition  hipaa created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including the medicare integrity program  and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to  for providing information on medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least of medicare funds 
penalties for violations of hipaa include civil and criminal monetary penalties 
hipaa and related hhs regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
hipaa regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information  whether communicated electronically  on paper  or orally 
the regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative  physical  and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically 
with the enactment of the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act as part of the arra  the privacy and security requirements of hipaa have been modified and expanded 
the hitech act applies certain of the hipaa privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements covered entities 
the modifications to existing hipaa requirements include expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records  tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising  and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance 
significantly  the hitech act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information 
hhs is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify individuals whose protected health information has been improperly disclosed 
in certain cases  notice of a breach is required to be made to hhs and media outlets 
the heightened penalties for noncompliance range from to  for single incidents to  to  for multiple identical violations 
in the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within days  penalties are not subject to a statutory maximum 
in addition  there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns 
facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these laws vary and could impose additional penalties 
any actual or perceived violation of these privacy related laws  including hipaa could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
hospital within hospital rules cms has enacted multiple regulations governing hospital within hospital arrangements for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs 
these regulations provide  among other things  that if a long term acute care hospital within hospital has medicare admissions from its host hospital that exceed a threshold of or an adjusted percentage for certain rural or metropolitan statistical area dominant hospitals of its medicare discharges for its cost reporting period  the ltch will receive an adjusted payment for its medicare patients of the lesser of the otherwise full payment under the ltch pps or a comparable payment that medicare would pay under the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
in determining whether an ltch meets the threshold criterion  patients transferred from the host hospital that have already qualified for outlier payments at that acute host would not count as part of the host hospital s allowable percentage 
cases admitted from the host hospital before the ltch crosses the threshold will be paid under the ltch pps 
additionally  other excluded hospitals or units of a host hospital  such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities and or units  must meet certain hospital within hospital requirements in order to maintain their excluded status and not be subject to the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
on july   cms regulations extended the referral limitation applicable to hospital within hospital locations to freestanding  satellite  and grandfathered ltchs 
all of our ltchs are freestanding 
the medicare act and the arra adopted in february  together  modified and delayed implementation of this extension of the rule and certain other portions of the hospital within hospital rules applicable to cost report periods through june  for five of our six ltchs and march  for the other 
these regulations did not materially impact our net operating revenues in however  if congress does not act to delay the implementation further this year  these new program policies may materially impact our net operating revenues in the future 
if postponed again this year  we cannot predict when or how these new program policies will affect us in the future

risk factors our business  operations  and financial position are subject to various risks 
some of these risks are described below  and you should take such risks into account in evaluating healthsouth or any investment decision involving healthsouth 
this section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us  our industry  or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
more detailed information concerning other risk factors as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report 
reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors and other legislative and regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our net operating revenues from the medicare program 
see item  business  sources of revenues  for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the healthcare system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
for the period from april  through september   the medicare act reduced the medicare reimbursement levels for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals to the levels existing in the third quarter of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms updated the fiscal year medicare reimbursement rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities with a market basket increase effective october  however  there can be no assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result in additional pricing roll backs or freezes  either generally or specifically targeted at the market basket increase 
at the time of this writing  the us senate and house of representatives have passed healthcare reform bills that differ significantly from each other 
both bills  however  attempt to address the issues of increasing access to and affordability of healthcare  increasing effectiveness of care  reducing inefficiencies and costs  emphasizing preventive care  and enhancing the fiscal sustainability of the federal healthcare programs 
several of the provisions of the bills could have an impact on our business 
we believe the three issues with the greatest potential impact are reducing annual market basket updates to providers  combining  or bundling  of acute care hospital and post acute medicare reimbursement at some point in the future  and creating an independent medicare advisory board 
some states in which we operate have also undertaken  or are considering  healthcare reform initiatives that address similar issues 
currently  the matter of healthcare reform continues to be debated by lawmakers  and we are unable to provide guidance on what any final legislation will be 
while many of the stated goals of the reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal to provide care that is high quality and cost effective  new legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements  increase the cost of compliance  and adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives  if any  will be enacted and implemented  or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us 
if we are not able to maintain increased case volumes to offset any future pricing roll back or freeze or increased costs associated with new regulatory compliance obligations  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our results could be further adversely affected by other changes in laws or regulations governing the medicare program  as well as possible changes to or expansion of the audit processes conducted by medicare contractors or medicare recovery audit contractors 
for additional discussion of healthcare reform and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services  see item  business  healthcare reform and sources of revenues medicare reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many third party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
our relationships with managed care and non governmental third party payors  such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third party payors 
additionally  our third party payors may  from time to time  request audits of the amounts paid  or to be paid  to us under our agreements with them 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operate if the auditing payor alleges that substantial overpayments were made to us due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations 
the adoption of more restrictive medicare coverage policies at the national or local levels could have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain medicare reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation services 
medicare providers also can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local levels  describing whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
in the absence of a national coverage determination  medicare contractors may specify more restrictive criteria than otherwise would apply nationally 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services is implementing new inpatient rehabilitation hospital coverage criteria effective january  that will require existing local coverage policies to be updated for each medicare contractor 
we cannot predict how the adoption of modified local coverage determinations or other policies will affect us 
for a discussion of the new inpatient rehabilitation hospital coverage criteria effective january   see item  business  sources of revenue medicare reimbursement inpatient rehabilitation services 
competition for staffing  shortages of qualified personnel  and union activity may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our management and medical support personnel  such as physical therapists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals 
we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers 
this shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
if our labor costs increase  we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs 
because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited 
union activity is another factor that contributes to increased labor costs 
various federal legislative proposals  including the proposed employee free choice act or card check bill  would likely result in increased union activity in general 
we cannot  however  predict the form or effect of final legislation  if any  that might promote union activity 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these laws and regulations relate to  among other things licensure  certification  and accreditation  coding and billing for services  requirements of the compliance threshold under the medicare act  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  including physician self referral and anti kickback laws  quality of medical care  use and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment  maintenance and security of medical records  
table of contents 
index to financial statements acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  and disposal of medical and hazardous waste 
in the future  changes in these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our investment structure  hospitals  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs  operating procedures  and contractual arrangements 
although we have invested substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties  including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals  and exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state healthcare programs 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our hospitals face national  regional  and local competition for patients from other healthcare providers 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
although we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services  in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that this competition  or other competition which we may encounter in the future  will not adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  weakening certificate of need laws in some states could potentially increase competition in those states 
we may have difficulty completing acquisitions  investments  or joint ventures consistent with our growth strategy  or we may make investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
we intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  and joint ventures with rehabilitative healthcare providers and  in the longer term  with other complementary post acute healthcare operations 
acquisitions may involve material cash expenditures  debt incurrence  additional operating losses  amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies  dilutive issuances of equity securities  and expenses that could affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
acquisitions  investments  and joint ventures involve numerous risks  including limitations  including competition to make acquisitions in certain markets  on our ability to identify acquisitions that meet our target criteria  limitations  including cms and other regulatory approval requirements  on our ability to complete such acquisitions on reasonable terms and valuations  limitations in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a reasonable cost  difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  and information systems  and in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings  entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired operations  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws

index to financial statements we remain a defendant in a number of lawsuits  and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases  the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we have settled the major litigation pending against us  we remain a defendant in a number of lawsuits  and the material lawsuits are discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our indebtedness may impair our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes 
as of december   we had approximately billion of long term debt outstanding including that portion of long term debt classified as current and excluding million in capital leases 
see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including reducing availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and certain other general corporate purposes 
it could also make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  in government regulation  and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for  and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to  changing conditions 
our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain various covenants 
for additional discussion of our material debt covenants  see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders and note holders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing debt 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement or senior note indentures could  if not cured  require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under those debt instruments  together with accrued interest 
if we were unable to pay such amounts  the lenders under our credit agreement could proceed against the collateral pledged to them 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to the lenders under our credit agreement 
see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and item  properties 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants 
see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants 
although we remained in compliance with the financial covenants as of december   there can be no assurance we will continue to be 
a severe downturn in earnings or a rapid increase in interest rates could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement 
we are also subject to numerous contingent liabilities  to prevailing economic conditions  and to financial  business  and other factors beyond our control 
although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions  we cannot assure you that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our debt agreements 
subject to specified limitations  our senior note indentures and our credit agreement permit us and our subsidiaries to incur material additional debt 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the risks described above could intensify 
uncertainty in the global credit markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our deleveraging and development objectives 
the global credit markets experienced significant disruptions in  and economic conditions remained volatile throughout  resulting in very sensitive credit markets 
future market shocks could result in reductions in the availability of certain types of debt financing  including access to revolving lines of credit 
future business needs combined with market conditions at the time may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
a return to recent tight credit markets would make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain 
the inability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as a result of credit market uncertainty  we also face potential exposure to counterparties who may be unable to adequately service our needs  including the ability of the lenders under our credit agreement to provide 
table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidity when needed 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  derivative counterparties  and insurance carriers using publicly available information  as well as qualitative service experience inputs 
we are generally confident we will have access to our revolving credit facility 
we do not face near term refinancing risk 
less than million of our long term debt is due before see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under our term loan facility  one tranche of million of outstanding principal matures in  and the other outstanding tranche of million of outstanding principal matures in the majority of our outstanding bonds will not mature until  with another million not due until our revolving credit facility  under which no amounts were outstanding as of december   does not expire until we may not be able to fully utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately billion 
these nols may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our federal income taxes otherwise payable 
while we believe we will be able to use these tax benefits before they expire over a period of twenty years  there can be no assurance that in the future we will have sufficient taxable income to do so 
for further discussion of our nols  including the valuation allowance for them  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its nols to reduce its tax liability 
an ownership change is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than by major holders of a corporation s stock over a three year period 
it is possible that future transactions  not all of which would be under the company s control  could cause us to undergo an ownership change as defined in section in that event  we would not be able to use our pre ownership change nols in excess of the limitation imposed by section at this time  we do not believe these limitations will affect our ability to use any nols before they expire 
however  no such assurances can be provided 
if we are unable to fully utilize our nols to offset taxable income generated in the future  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and negatively impacted 
if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement  or if the hhs oig determines we have violated federal laws governing kickbacks  false claims and self referrals  we could be subject to severe sanctions  including substantial civil money penalties 
in december  we entered into a corporate integrity agreement the cia with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the hhs oig to promote our compliance with the requirements of medicare  medicaid  and all other federal healthcare programs 
we have also entered into two addenda to this agreement 
the cia expired at the end of  subject to the hhs oig accepting and approving our annual report for that we intend to submit in the first half of under the agreement and addenda  we are subject to certain administrative requirements and are subject to review of certain medicare cost reports and reimbursement claims by an independent review organization see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have complied with the requirements of the cia on a timely basis  and to date  there are no objections or unresolved comments from the hhs oig relating to our annual reports 
however  failure to meet our obligations under the cia could result in stipulated financial penalties or extension of the term of the cia 
a determination by the hhs oig that we failed to comply with the material terms of the cia could lead to exclusion from further participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  which currently account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
further  if the hhs oig determines we have violated the anti kickback laws  the false claims act  or the federal stark statute s general prohibition on physician self referrals  we may be subject to significant civil monetary penalties and may be excluded from further participation in federal healthcare programs 
any of these sanctions would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

executive overview our business we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long term acute care hospitals ltchs and provide treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including hospitals that operate as joint ventures which we account for using the equity method of accounting  freestanding ltchs  outpatient rehabilitation satellites operated by our hospitals  including one joint venture satellite  and licensed  hospital based home health agencies 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals  we manage six inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts 
our inpatient hospitals are located in states and puerto rico  with a concentration of hospitals in texas  pennsylvania  florida  tennessee  alabama  and arizona 
we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services in terms of revenues  number of hospitals  and patients treated and discharged 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive  high quality  cost effective patient care services 
the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical disabilities due to medical conditions  such as strokes  hip fractures  head injury  spinal cord injury  and neurological disorders  that are non discretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
our team of highly skilled physicians  nurses  and physical  occupational  and speech therapists utilize the latest in equipment and techniques to return patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by a physician order 
internal case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation of patient status  achievement of goals  discharge planning  and functional outcomes 
our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to what we believe is a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
net patient revenue from our hospitals increased from to due primarily to a year over year increase in inpatient discharges 
same store discharges experienced growth of from to operating earnings as defined in note  quarterly data unaudited  to the accompanying consolidated financial

operating earnings for the year ended december  included gains of million associated with government  class action  and related settlements expense  including the gain on ubs settlement see note  settlements  to the accompanyingconsolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows during included million related to the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement and the receipt of million in income tax refunds see note  income taxes  and note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see the results of operations section of this item for additional information 
throughout  we focused our efforts on providing high quality  cost effective care  enhancing the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  sustaining discharge growth  and growing our business organically through increased market share and capacity expansions 
the collapse of the credit markets in contributed to a tight credit market for most of  requiring us to balance pursuing development opportunities against our deleveraging priority 
while doing so  we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million and improved our overall debt profile by amending our credit agreement to extend the maturity of a portion of our term loan facility and by refinancing a portion of our outstanding senior notes  which also reduced our exposure to floating interest rates 
see this item  liquidity and capital resources  note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as we made strides in reducing our debt and saw some improvement in the credit markets  we began to shift our strategy to pursuing disciplined development opportunities 
our development projects in included opening a new  bed freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospital in mesa  arizona in the third quarter of  beginning construction on our new  bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in loudoun county  virginia  and announcing that our joint venture with wellmont health system received a certificate of need to open a new  bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in bristol  virginia 
we expect operations to commence in those virginia locations in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
in addition  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation unit in altoona  pennsylvania through a newly formed joint venture and relocated its operations to one of our hospitals and acquired  effective january   a bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in little rock  arkansas through an existing joint venture in which we participate 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services will increase as the us population ages 
in addition  the number of patients who qualify for inpatient rehabilitative care under medicare rules is expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths in  and focus on  inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike many of our competitors that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
key challenges while we met our operational goals in  the following are some of the challenges we are addressing leverage and liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operations which were million during the year ended december   including million in net cash proceeds related to the ubs settlement and the receipt of million in income tax refunds  as discussed below  and borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excluded million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities 
as of december   no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility 
while we have improved our leverage and liquidity  further deleveraging is  and will continue to be  a strategic focus 
during the year ended december   we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million and increased our cash and cash equivalents by approximately million 
during  we will continue to analyze our balance sheet  and we will use our available cash in a manner that provides the most beneficial impact to our capital structure  including further debt reduction and deleveraging 
we believe our higher adjusted consolidated ebitda and our strong cash flows from operations will allow us to continue to reduce our leverage

highly regulated industry 
over the last several years  changes in regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created challenges for inpatient rehabilitative providers 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on  and in some cases  reductions in  the levels of payments to healthcare providers 
for example  and as reported previously  while the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of signed on december  may have stabilized much of the volatility in patient volumes created by setting the compliance threshold of the rule at  it also included a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of the medicare pricing roll back 
see item  business  sources of revenue  for additional information 
during the period of the medicare pricing roll back  we incurred increased costs  including costs associated with providing annual merit increases and benefits to our employees  without a corresponding increase to our medicare reimbursement 
this medicare pricing roll back expired on september  on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published in the federal register the fiscal year notice of final rulemaking for inpatient rehabilitation facilities under the prospective payment system irf pps 
this rule contains medicare pricing changes as well as new coverage requirements 
the pricing changes are effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  and include a market basket update  which was the first market basket update we had received in months 
however  as discussed below  the various healthcare bills being discussed in congress include reductions to market basket updates for providers as a means of helping to pay for healthcare reform 
accordingly  it is possible this market basket update could be reduced by congress 
see item  business  sources of revenues  for information related to market basket updates 
we have analyzed the other aspects of the fiscal year final rule and believe the remaining changes will have a neutral to slightly positive impact on our net operating revenues 
the new coverage requirements under the rule apply to discharges occurring on or after january  prior to the new rule  our hospitals already operated using many of the new requirements  so these changes have not resulted in material modifications to our clinical or business models 
although these new requirements have only been in effect for a short time  we believe we are in compliance with them 
additionally  we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these rules and regulations affect our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources  regulating the use of our properties  and controlling our growth 
ensuring continuous compliance with these laws and regulations is an operating requirement for all healthcare providers 
we have invested substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  and we are committed to continued adherence to these guidelines 
more specifically  because medicare comprises a significant portion of our net operating revenues  it is important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the medicare program 
if we were unable to remain compliant with these regulations  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially  adversely impacted 
potential impact of healthcare reform 
although president obama has identified healthcare reform as a major domestic priority  and congress has devoted considerable effort to drafting healthcare reform legislation  at the time of this writing  no specific healthcare reform legislation has been adopted 
the future of healthcare reform appears uncertain at this time 
many issues are being discussed within the context of healthcare reform  several of which could have an impact on our business 
the three issues with the greatest potential impact are reducing annual market basket updates to providers  
table of contents 
index to financial statements combining  or bundling  of acute care hospital and post acute medicare reimbursement at some point in the future  and creating an independent medicare advisory board 
with respect to future reductions to market basket updates  and as previously noted  while no specific healthcare legislation has been adopted at this time  the healthcare reform bills that have been passed by both the us senate and the house of representatives include some kind of reduction to market basket updates 
while we cannot be certain of the magnitude of these potential market basket reductions  or if they will be enacted  we will be working with other providers  as well as other interested parties  to help ensure they do not compromise our ability to provide high quality services to the patients we serve 
the probability of enacting a bundled payment system is difficult to predict at this time 
the major healthcare reform bills being contemplated currently by congress include provisions to examine the feasibility of bundling  including the potential for a voluntary bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies 
we will continue to work with the acute hospital and post acute care provider communities on this important issue 
there has also been discussion of establishing an independent medicare advisory board that would be charged with presenting proposals to congress to reduce medicare expenditures upon the occurrence of medicare expenditures exceeding a certain level 
at this point  it is difficult to determine whether this board will be enacted into law  and  if so  how it would function 
similar to the reform concerns discussed above  we will continue to work with other providers  as well as other parties who have a vested interest  to help ensure they do not compromise our ability to provide high quality services to the patients we serve 
staffing 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical personnel  such as physical therapists  occupational therapists  speech pathologists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of medical personnel is an operating issue facing all healthcare providers  although the weak economy has mitigated this issue to some degree 
we have refined our comprehensive benefits package to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while also being consistent with our goal of being a high quality  cost effective provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
as a result of our efforts  we are experiencing improved retention rates and reduced turnover 
going forward  recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our hospitals will remain a high priority for us 
we also are monitoring efforts in congress that could make it more difficult for employees to avoid or reject labor organization 
at this time  it is not clear whether  when  or in what form  such legislation might be enacted into law  nor are we able to predict the impact  if any  this legislation would have on our business  if enacted 
business outlook as previously noted  the inpatient rehabilitation sector of the healthcare industry is an attractive market the aging demographics of the us population coupled with an approximate projected annual growth rate in the number of patients who qualify for inpatient rehabilitative care under medicare rules create a favorable business environment for us 
as the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our broad base of clinical expertise  the quality of our clinical outcomes  the application and leverage of rehabilitative technology  and the standardization of best practices that result in high quality  cost effective care for the patients we serve 
our ability to continue to create shareholder value in the near term will be predicated on our ability to deleverage our balance sheet  provide high quality  cost effective care  grow organically  pursue acquisitions on a disciplined  opportunistic basis  and adapt to regulatory changes affecting our industry 
during the year ended december   we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million  and we believe our higher adjusted consolidated ebitda and our strong cash flows from operations will allow us to continue to reduce our debt and leverage 
further  we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity due 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to our cash and cash equivalents and the availability of our revolving credit facility 
in addition  and as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this item  we do not face near term refinancing risk 
we believe our ability to continue to grow at a faster rate than the rest of the industry is attributable to our higher level of care and is sustainable 
in addition  the majority of patients we serve have medical conditions  such as strokes  hip fractures  and neurological disorders  that are non discretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative services in an inpatient setting 
healthcare providers are under increasing pressure to control healthcare costs 
we take this challenge seriously and pride ourselves in our ability to provide high quality  cost effective care 
we will continue to focus on ensuring we provide high quality care and finding efficiencies in our cost structure at both the corporate and operational levels in an effort to remain competitive 
our largest costs are our salaries and benefits  and they represent our investment in our most valuable resource our employees 
we continue to actively manage these expenses 
we will continue to monitor the labor market and will make any necessary adjustments to remain competitive in this challenging environment while also being consistent with our goal of being a high quality  cost effective provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
while deleveraging will remain a priority  our deleveraging efforts in will focus on growing adjusted consolidated ebitda through organic growth and disciplined expansion 
our organic growth will result from increasing our market share of inpatient discharges  actively managing expenses  and pursuing capacity expansions in existing hospitals to meet growing demand in certain markets 
during  our adjusted consolidated ebitda will also benefit from our development activities  as described above 
in addition to organic growth  we will pursue acquisitions  joint ventures  and market consolidations of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  and we will continue to look for appropriate markets for de novo sites 
for any de novo project we decide to pursue  we may work with third parties willing to assume the majority of the financing risks associated with these projects 
as discussed previously  healthcare always has been a highly regulated industry  and the inpatient rehabilitation segment is no exception 
successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality care and have the capabilities to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment 
we believe we have the necessary capabilities scale  infrastructure  and management to adapt and succeed in a highly regulated industry  and we have a proven track record of being able to do so 
the healthcare reform proposals that are being discussed are fluid and changing 
however  we are confident  based on our track record  we will be able to adapt to whatever changes may impact our industry 
in summary  we believe the business outlook is positive 
we will continue to monitor the economic and regulatory climates and focus on initiatives designed to control costs 
we anticipate we will be able to continue to generate strong cash flows that will be directed toward opportunistic  disciplined expansion and growth of our inpatient business and debt reduction  which we believe will bring long term  sustainable growth and returns to our stockholders 
finally  we will continue to work with the acute hospital and post acute care provider communities  as well as other interested parties  to bring positive healthcare reform that rewards healthcare providers  like healthsouth  that strive to provide high quality  cost effective services to patients who need these services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements results of operations during   and  we derived consolidated net operating revenues from the following payor sources for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our payor mix is weighted heavily towards medicare 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under irf pps 
under irf pps  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
with irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
for additional information regarding medicare reimbursement  see the sources of revenues section of item  business 
over the past few years  we have experienced an increase in managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in the managed care and other discount plans category in the above table 
as part of the balanced budget act of  congress created a program of private  managed healthcare coverage for medicare beneficiaries 
this program has been referred to as medicare part c  or medicare advantage 
the program offers beneficiaries a range of medicare coverage options by providing a choice between the traditional fee for service program under medicare parts a and b or enrollment in a health maintenance organization  preferred provider organization  point of service plan  provider sponsored organization  or an insurance plan operated in conjunction with a medical savings account 
while we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards traditional medicare  we expect this increase of patients in managed medicare and private fee for service plans will continue 
however  the future of medicare advantage will be determined  ultimately  by congress  and any changes to medicare advantage may have an impact on this trend 
under irf pps  hospitals are reimbursed on a per discharge basis 
thus  the number of patient discharges is a key metric utilized by management to monitor and evaluate our performance 
the number of outpatient visits is also tracked in order to measure the volume of outpatient activity each period 
certain financial results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
during  we terminated the leases associated with certain rental properties and reached an agreement to sell one of our hospitals to a third party 
as a result  we reclassified our consolidated balance sheet as of december  to show the assets and liabilities of these facilities as held for sale 
we also reclassified our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and to include these properties and their results of operations as discontinued operations 
as of january   we reclassified our noncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests as a component of equity and now report net income and comprehensive income attributable to our noncontrolling interests separately from net income and comprehensive income attributable to healthsouth 
during the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ended june   we identified an error in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and prior periods and our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarterly period ended march  we corrected this error in our financial statements by adjusting equity in net income of nonconsolidated affiliates  which resulted in an understatement of both our income loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit and our net income of approximately million for the year ended december  this error related primarily to an approximate million overstatement of our investment in a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements joint venture hospital we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the understatement of prior period income tax provisions of this joint venture hospital and the adjustment of certain liabilities due to this joint venture hospital 
we also adjusted other current liabilities by approximately million due to changes in amounts due to us for expenses paid on behalf of this joint venture hospital 
we do not believe these adjustments are material to the consolidated financial statements as of december  or to any prior years consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have not restated any prior period amounts

in the discussion that follows  we use same store comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics and line items within our financial statements 
we calculate same store comparisons based on hospitals open throughout both the full current period and throughout the full prior periods presented 
these comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets  as it is difficult to determine  with precision  the incremental impact of these transactions on our results of operations

net operating revenues also include other revenues generated from management and administrative fees and other

these other revenues approximated   and of consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our net operating revenues were negatively impacted in and by the pricing roll back that was part of the medicare act  as discussed above 
the pricing roll back was effective from april  until september  however  as reported previously  the roll out of our teamworks initiative in produced results that yielded an increase in patient discharges in each quarter of during the latter part of and early  we implemented a sustainability module to ensure the operational initiatives from the start up phase of the teamworks project remained embedded at our hospitals 
this continued focus on the teamworks initiative  coupled with the dedication and hard work of our employees  allowed us to continue to generate discharge growth throughout  in spite of the difficult comparisons to s growth 
this growth in discharges helped mitigate the negative impact of the pricing roll back 
net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher in than  and it was higher in than the increase in each year was primarily attributable to a and  respectively  year over year increase in patient discharges 
same store discharges were higher in than and higher in than net patient revenue per discharge increased in both and due primarily to higher average acuity for the patients we served 
net patient revenue from our hospitals in also benefitted from the acquisition of a hospital in vineland  new jersey and two market consolidation transactions in texas 
decreased outpatient volumes in all periods presented resulted primarily from the closure of outpatient satellites  but challenges in securing therapy staffing for these outpatient satellites in certain markets and continued competition from physicians offering physical therapy services within their own offices also contributed to the decline 
as of december    and  we operated   and outpatient satellites  respectively  including one joint venture satellite 
strong unit pricing and the closure of underperforming satellites resulted in higher net patient revenue per visit in each year 
we continuously monitor the performance of our outpatient satellites and will take appropriate action with respect to underperforming facilities  including closure 
see this item  executive overview key challenges  and item  business  healthcare reform  for a discussion of potential future reductions to market basket updates 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits represent the most significant cost to us and represent an investment in our most important asset our employees 
salaries and benefits include all amounts paid to full and part time employees who directly participate in or support the operations of our hospitals  including all related costs of benefits provided to employees 
it also includes amounts paid for contract labor 
we actively manage the productive portion of our salaries and benefits utilizing certain metrics  including employees per occupied bed  or epob 
this metric is determined by dividing the number of full time equivalents  including an estimate of full time equivalents from the utilization of contract labor  by the number of occupied beds during each period 
the number of occupied beds is determined by multiplying the number of licensed beds by our occupancy percentage 
for the years ended december    and  our epob was   and  respectively  or a year over year improvement of and in and  respectively 
salaries and benefits were   and of net operating revenues in   and  respectively 
the increase from to was due primarily to non productive factors such as annual merit increases given to employees without an offsetting increase in our pricing due to the medicare pricing roll back discussed above  enhanced benefits  and training and orienting new employees needed as a result of additional volumes 
during late  we addressed our comprehensive benefits package and made refinements that allowed us  and will continue to allow us  to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while also being consistent with our goal of being a high quality  low cost provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
such refinements included  but were not limited to  passing along a portion of the increased costs associated with medical plan benefits to our employees and reducing certain aspects of our paid time off program 
also  as a result of our recruiting and retention efforts  costs associated with contract labor decreased in as a result  salaries and benefits as a percent of net operating revenues decreased from to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements as it is routine to provide merit increases to our employees on october of each year  which normally coincides with our annual medicare pricing adjustment  we provided an approximate merit increase to our employees effective october  our staffing priority is always to effectively treat our patients and to continue achieving the excellence in clinical outcomes that differentiates us from our competitors 
we will continue to actively manage the productive component of our salaries and benefits  and we will continue to focus on our recruiting and retention efforts 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include costs associated with managing and maintaining our hospitals 
these expenses include such items as contract services  utilities  insurance  professional fees  and repairs and maintenance 
in and  we experienced a reduction in self insurance costs due to revised actuarial estimates that resulted from current claims history and industry wide loss development trends 
these reductions were primarily included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and see note  self insured risks  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other operating expenses were higher during than in primarily due to increased patient volumes and the year over year impact of the reduction in self insurance costs discussed above 
other operating expenses were higher during than in primarily due to increased patient volumes  repairs and maintenance expenses associated with the refurbishment of some of our aging hospitals  and costs associated with the implementation of our teamworks initiative 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include administrative expenses such as information technology services  corporate accounting  human resources  internal audit and controls  and legal services that are managed from our corporate headquarters in birmingham  alabama

general and administrative expenses as a percent of net operating revenues decreased from to due primarily to a reduction in corporate related  full time equivalents and moving certain processes in house versus using external consultants and other professionals 
our general and administrative expenses were lower in compared to due primarily to the right sizing of our corporate departments following the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses resulting from our divestiture transactions was partially offset by rent expense associated with the sale of our corporate campus and subsequent leasing of our corporate office space within the same property that was sold 
supplies supplies expense includes all costs associated with supplies used while providing patient care 
these costs include pharmaceuticals  food  needles  bandages  and other similar items

provision for doubtful accounts as disclosed previously  we have experienced denials of certain diagnosis codes by medicare contractors based on medical necessity 
we appeal most of these denials and have experienced a strong success rate for claims that have completed the appeals process 
while our success rate is a positive reflection of the medical necessity of the applicable patients  the appeal process can take in excess of one year  and we cannot provide assurance as to the ongoing and future success of our appeals 
as such  we have made provisions against these receivables in accordance with our accounting policy that necessarily considers the age of the receivables under appeal as part of

fluctuations in these amounts are primarily driven by the financial performance of the applicable hospital population each period 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company will be primarily in the area of labor costs 
the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
while we believe the current economic climate may help to moderate wage increases in the near term  there can be no guarantee we will not experience increases in the cost of labor  as the need for clinical healthcare professionals is expected to grow 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
while we currently are able to accommodate increased pricing related to supplies  especially pharmaceutical costs  and other operating expenses  we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases 
adherence to cost containment should allow us to manage the effects of inflation on future operating results 
it should be noted that we have little or no ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing services to medicare and medicaid patients due to federal and state laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates

our progress was confirmed during the second quarter of when moody s upgraded our corporate credit rating to b  allowing the spread on our term loan facility to be reduced by basis points effective june  in addition  standard and poor s moved our outlook to positive from stable 
during the year ended december   we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million and increased our cash and cash equivalents by approximately million 
in addition to our debt reduction  we improved our overall debt profile by refinancing senior notes  extending a portion of our term loan facility  and amending other terms of our credit agreement 
in february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
in addition  we used a portion of the net proceeds from our settlement with ubs see note  settlements  to the accompanying

see note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities 
our restricted assets pertain to obligations we have under partnership agreements and other arrangements  primarily related to our captive insurance company 
cash and cash equivalents increased during primarily due to strong operational cash flows as a result of increased inpatient discharges and non operating cash flows received in the ubs settlement see note  settlement  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and from income tax refunds see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this increase was also in spite of the use of cash for debt service  principal prepayments  and costs associated with refinancing transactions 
we continue to analyze our capital structure  and we will use our available cash in a manner that provides the most beneficial impact and return to our shareholders  including development opportunities and deleveraging 
as of december   we had all million available to us under our revolving credit facility 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  insurance carriers  and other counterparties using publicly available information  as well as qualitative inputs 
based on our current borrowing capacity and compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
however  no such assurances can be provided 
in addition  we anticipate cash flows from certain non operating sources  such as those related to certain legal matters discussed in note  settlements  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
however  no assurances can be given as to whether or when such non operating cash flows will be received or as to the collectability of any amounts owed to us 
we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to long term debt obligations see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we do not face near term refinancing risk  as our revolving credit facility does not expire until  a portion of our term loan facility does not mature until  with the remainder maturing in  and the majority of our bonds are not due until and our credit agreement governs the vast majority of our senior secured borrowings and contains financial covenants that include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
under such circumstances  there is also the potential our lenders would not grant relief to us which  among other things  would depend on the state of the credit markets at that time 
however  we believe we have reduced this risk by significantly lowering our senior secured leverage ratio since the inception of our credit agreement

adjusted consolidated ebitda management continues to believe adjusted consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement is a measure of our ability to service our debt and our ability to make capital expenditures 
we use adjusted consolidated ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these covenants are material terms of the credit agreement  and the credit agreement represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants  we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness  making certain payments  and acquiring and disposing of assets 
consequently  adjusted consolidated ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
in general terms  the definition of adjusted consolidated ebitda  per our credit agreement  allows us to add back to or subtract from consolidated net income unusual non cash or non recurring items 
these items include  but may not be limited to  amounts associated with government  class action  and related settlements  amounts related to discontinued operations and closed locations  charges in respect of professional fees for reconstruction and restatement of financial statements  including fees paid to outside professional firms for matters related to internal controls and legal fees for continued litigation defense and support matters discussed in note  settlements  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  stock based compensation expense  net investment and other income including interest income  and fees associated with our divestiture activities 
we reconcile adjusted consolidated ebitda to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities 
in accordance with the credit agreement  we are allowed to add certain other items to the calculation of adjusted consolidated ebitda  and there may also be certain other deductions required 
this includes the interest income associated with income tax recoveries  as discussed in note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are allowed to add non recurring cash gains  such as the cash proceeds from the ubs settlement see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to the calculation of adjusted consolidated ebitda 
as these adjustments may not be indicative of our ongoing performance  they have been excluded from adjusted consolidated ebitda presented herein 
however  adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and the items excluded from adjusted consolidated ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
therefore  adjusted consolidated ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities 
because adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted consolidated ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for the company 
we are secondarily liable for certain lease obligations primarily associated with sold facilities  including the sale of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during as of december   we were secondarily liable for such guarantees 
the remaining terms of these guarantees range from one month to months 
if we were required to perform under all such guarantees  the maximum amount we would be required to pay approximated million 
we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under these agreements 
if we are required to perform under these guarantees  we could potentially have recourse against the purchaser for recovery of any amounts paid 
in addition  the purchasers of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions have agreed to seek releases from the lessors and vendors in favor of healthsouth with respect to the guarantee obligations associated with these divestitures 
to the extent the purchasers of these divisions are unable to obtain releases for healthsouth  the purchasers have agreed to indemnify healthsouth for damages incurred under the guarantee obligations  if any 
for additional information regarding these guarantees  see note  guarantees  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  as discussed in note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  our securities litigation settlement agreement requires us to indemnify the settling insurance carriers  to the extent permitted by law  for any amounts they are legally obligated to pay to any non settling defendants 
as of december   we have not recorded a liability regarding these indemnifications  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under the indemnification portion of these settlement agreements  and any amount we would be required to pay is not estimable at this time 
as of december   we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
as of december   we hold four derivative financial instruments 
two are interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments 
the first was entered into in march to effectively convert the floating rate of a portion of our credit agreement to a fixed rate in order to limit the variability of interest related 
table of contents 
index to financial statements payments caused by changes in libor 
the second was entered into in june as a mirror offset to the first swap in order to reduce our effective fixed rate to total debt ratio 
the other two derivative instruments are forward starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges 
we entered into these swaps as a cash flow hedge of future interest payments on our term loan facility 
see note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions total and thereafter long term debt obligations long term debt  excluding revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations a interest on long term debt b capital lease obligations c operating lease obligations d e purchase obligations e f other long term liabilities g total a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our bonds payable and other notes payable 
these borrowings are further explained in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b interest on our fixed rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate 
interest expense on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of december  interest related to capital lease obligations is excluded from this line 
amounts exclude amortization of debt discounts  amortization of loan fees  or fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
amounts also exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 
c amounts include interest portion of future minimum capital lease payments 
d we lease many of our hospitals as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our hospital leases require percentage rentals on patient revenues above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of december   these amounts exclude million of operating lease obligations associated with facilities that are reported in discontinued operations 
e future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
f purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on healthsouth and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase 
table of contents 
index to financial statements obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support  medical supplies  certain equipment  and telecommunications 
g because their future cash outflows are uncertain  the following noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above medical malpractice and workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  and our estimated liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  self insured risks  note  income taxes  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  at december  we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we had an accrual for related interest income of million as of december  we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining state income tax refund claims 
the process of resolving these tax matters with the applicable taxing authorities will continue in at this time  we cannot estimate a range of the reasonably possible change that may occur 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  healthsouth enters into contractual arrangements under which healthsouth may agree to indemnify another party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of healthsouth or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
see also note  contingencies and commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for indemnification obligations alleged by mr 
scrushy 
in addition  in connection with the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  we have certain post closing indemnification obligations to the respective purchasers 
these indemnification obligations arose from liabilities not assumed by the purchasers  such as certain types of litigation  any breach by us of the purchase agreements  liabilities associated with assets that were excluded from the divestitures  and other types of liabilities that are customary in transactions of these types 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgment that affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates  and judgments to ensure our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize net patient service revenues in the reporting period in which we perform the service based on our current billing rates ie  gross charges  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans 
we record gross service charges in our accounting records on an accrual basis using our established rates for the type of service provided to the patient 
we recognize an estimated contractual allowance to reduce gross patient charges to the amount we estimate we will actually realize for the service rendered based upon previously agreed to rates with a payor 
our patient accounting system calculates contractual allowances on a patient by patient basis based on the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements rates in effect for each primary third party payor 
other factors that are considered and could further influence the level of our reserves include the patient s total length of stay for in house patients  the proportion of patients with secondary insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement under that secondary coverage  and the amount of charges that will be disallowed by payors 
such additional factors are assumed to remain consistent with the experience for patients discharged in similar time periods for the same payor classes  and additional reserves are provided to account for these factors  accordingly 
payors include federal and state agencies  including medicare and medicaid  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies  employers  and patients 
management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals 
in addition  laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
due to complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  which are often subject to interpretation  we may receive reimbursement for healthcare services authorized and provided that is different from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare  managed care payors  other third party payors  and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
the primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but patient responsibility amounts deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  our historical collection experience for each type of payor  and other relevant factors so that the remaining receivables  net of allowances  are reflected at their estimated net realizable values 
accounts requiring collection efforts are reviewed via system generated work queues that automatically stage based on age and size of outstanding balance accounts requiring collection efforts for patient account representatives 
collection efforts include contacting the applicable party both in writing and by telephone  providing information both financial and clinical to allow for payment or to overturn payor decisions to deny payment  and arranging payment plans with self pay patients  among other techniques 
when we determine that all in house efforts have been exhausted or that it is a more prudent use of resources  accounts may be turned over to a collection agency 
accounts are written off after all collection efforts internal and external have been exhausted 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix  or trends in federal or state governmental and private employer healthcare coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

index to financial statements the table below shows a summary aging of our net accounts receivable balance as of december  and information on the concentration of total patient accounts receivable by payor class can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  accounts receivable  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december  in millions days days days days days patient accounts receivable non patient accounts receivable accounts receivable  net self insured risks we are self insured for certain losses related to professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims  a substantial portion of our professional and general liability and workers compensation risks are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
obligations covered by reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the subsidiary  or its parent  as appropriate  remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their obligations 
our reserves and provisions for professional and general liability and workers compensation risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates calculated by third party actuaries 
the actuaries consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  exposure data  loss development  and geography 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
changes to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results 
all reserves are undiscounted 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the reserves for professional and general liability and workers compensation risks cover approximately  individual claims as of december  and estimates for unreported claims 
the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated 
the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges  unless there is an offer to purchase such assets  which would be the basis for determining fair value 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that represents the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review methodology described herein  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million in discontinued operations during the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  at the reporting unit level 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october st of each year 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using generally accepted valuation techniques including the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach includes the use of our reporting unit s projected operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions 
the projected operating results use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the forecasted period including assumptions for pricing and volume  operating expenses  and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include cost saving synergies and tax benefits that would accrue to a market participant under a fair value methodology 
we validate our estimates under the income approach by reconciling the estimated fair value of our reporting unit determined under the income approach to our market capitalization and estimated fair value determined under the market approach 
the market approach estimates fair value through the use of observable inputs  including the company s stock price 
values from the income approach and market approach are then evaluated and weighted to arrive at the estimated aggregate fair value of the reporting unit 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of october   using the methodology described herein  and determined no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment charges 
however  at this time  we believe our reporting unit is not at risk for any impairment charges 
our other intangible assets consist of acquired certificates of need  licenses  noncompete agreements  and market access assets 
we amortize these assets over their respective estimated useful lives  which typically range from to years 
all of our other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line basis  except for our market access assets  which are amortized using an accelerated basis see below 
as of december   we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we continue to review the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our other intangible assets is determined using discounted cash flows and significant unobservable inputs 
our market access assets are valued using discounted cash flows under the income approach 
the value of the market access assets is attributable to our ability to gain access to and penetrate the former facility s historical market patient base 
to determine this value  we first develop a debt free net cash flow forecast under various patient volume scenarios 
the debt free net cash flow is then discounted back to present value using a discount factor  which includes an adjustment for company specific risk 
we amortize these assets over years using an accelerated basis that reflects the pattern in which we believe the economic benefits of the market access assets will be consumed 

table of contents 
index to financial statements share based payments all share based payments are required to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
for our stock options  the fair value is estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
for our restricted stock awards that contain a service condition and or a performance condition  fair value is based on our closing stock price on the grant date 
we use a monte carlo approach to the binomial model to measure fair value for restricted stock that vests upon the achievement of a service condition and a market condition 
inputs into the model include the historical price volatility of our common stock  the historical volatility of the common stock of the companies in the defined peer group  and the risk free interest rate 
utilizing these inputs and potential future changes in stock prices  multiple trials are run to determine the fair value 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation expense recorded in each year 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we estimate our expected term through an analysis of actual  historical post vesting exercise  cancellation  and expiration behavior by our employees and projected post vesting activity of outstanding options 
we currently calculate volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options  excluding a distinct period of extreme volatility between and the risk free interest rate is the implied daily yield currently available on us treasury issues with a remaining term closely approximating the expected term used as the input to the black scholes option pricing model 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we do not include a dividend payment as part of our pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures through an analysis of actual  historical pre vesting option forfeiture activity 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to expense adjustments that could be material to our results of operations 
compensation expense related to performance based awards may vary each reporting period based on changes in the expected achievement of performance measures 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at december  aggregating million against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and other factors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining state income tax refund claims 
the actual amount of the refunds will not be finally determined until all of the applicable taxing authorities have completed their review 
although management believes its estimates and judgments related to these claims are reasonable  depending on the ultimate resolution of these tax matters  actual amounts recovered could differ from management s estimates  and such differences could be material 
assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies that could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded it is probable a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingent matter 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on these items 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates impacts the net fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows 
interest rate changes on variable rate debt impact our interest expense and cash flows  but do not impact the net fair value of the underlying debt instruments 
our fixed and variable rate debt excluding capital lease obligations and other notes payable as of december  is shown in the following table in millions as of december  carrying amount of total estimated fair value of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt total long term debt as discussed in note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the floating rate of a portion of our credit agreement to a fixed rate in order to limit the variability of interest related payments caused by changes in libor 
under this interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of on an amortizing notional principal of billion  while the counterparties to this interest rate swap agreement pay a floating rate based on month libor 
per the underlying swap agreement  the notional amount of this interest rate swap is scheduled to decrease from billion as of december  to million in march as also discussed in note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in june  we entered into a receive fixed swap as a mirror offset to million of the billion interest rate swap discussed above in order to reduce our effective fixed rate to total debt ratio 
our variable rate interest expense increases or decreases as interest rates change 
however  the net settlement payments or receipts on interest rate swaps described above offset a majority of those changes 
because these swaps are not designated as hedges  net settlements are included in the line item loss on interest rate swaps in the consolidated statements of operations and are not included in interest expense 

table of contents 
index to financial statements based on the size of our variable rate debt as of december  and inclusive of the impact of the net conversion of billion of variable rate interest to a fixed rate via interest rate swaps  as discussed above  a increase in interest rates would result in an incremental positive cash flow of approximately million over the next months 
because our variable rate debt and interest rate swaps are indexed to libor  which was below as of december   our down rate scenario assumes a interest rate for the next months  which would result in an incremental negative cash flow of approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates results in negative cash flow due to our hedging position  the current low libor rate  and the assumption that libor will not fall below 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the estimated net fair value of our fixed rate debt  and a decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate million increase in its estimated net fair value 
we also maintain two forward starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges 
see note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
there will be no cash flow impact associated with these forward starting swaps over the next months because net settlements do not begin until june foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies  are currently  and have been  insignificant to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
