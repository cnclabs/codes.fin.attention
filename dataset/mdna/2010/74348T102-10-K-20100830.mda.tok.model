we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows 
we seek to be a long term investor with our portfolio companies 
from our july  inception to the fiscal year ended june   we invested primarily in industries related to the industrial energy economy 
since then  we have widened our strategy to focus in other sectors of the economy and continue to diversify our portfolio holdings 
the aggregate value of our portfolio investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   our net cost of investments increased by  or  primarily as a result of the acquisition of patriot capital funding  inc patriot and our investment in three new and several follow on investments while we sold one investment and we received repayment on eight other investments 
compared to the end of last fiscal year ended june   net assets increased by  or during the year ended june   from  to  this increase resulted from the issuance of new shares of our common stock less offering costs in the amount of  equity issued in conjunction with the patriot acquisition of  dividend reinvestments of  and another  from operations 
these increases  in turn  were offset by  in dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the  increase in net assets resulting from operations is net of the following net investment income of  realized loss on investments of  and a net increase in net assets due to changes in net unrealized appreciation of investments of  patriot acquisition on december   we acquired the outstanding shares of patriot capital funding  inc patriot common stock for  under the terms of the merger agreement  patriot common shareholders received shares of our common stock for each share of patriot common stock  resulting in  shares of common stock being issued by us 
in connection with the transaction  we repaid all the outstanding borrowings of patriot  in compliance with the merger agreement 
on december   patriot made a final dividend equal to its undistributed net ordinary income and capital gains of per share 
in accordance with a recent irs revenue procedure  the dividend was paid in cash and in newly issued shares of patriot s common stock 
the exchange ratio was adjusted to give effect to the tax distribution 
the merger has been accounted for as an acquisition of patriot by prospect capital corporation prospect in accordance with acquisition method of accounting as detailed in asc  business combinations asc 
the fair value of the consideration paid was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as the date of acquisition 
as described in more detail in asc  goodwill  if any  would have been recognized as of the acquisition date  if the consideration transferred exceeded the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
as of the acquisition date  the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeded the fair value of the consideration transferred  and we recognized the excess as a gain 
a preliminary gain of  was recorded by prospect in the quarter ended december  related to the acquisition of patriot  which was revised in the fourth quarter of fiscal  to  when we settled severance accruals related to certain members of patriot s top management 
under asc  the adjustment to our preliminary estimates is reflected in the three and six months ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements the acquisition of patriot was negotiated in july with the purchase agreement being signed on august  between july and december   our valuation of certain of the investments acquired from patriot increased due to market improvement  which resulted in the recognition of the gain at closing 

table of contents the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as summarized in the following table cash to repay patriot debt cash to fund purchase of restricted stock from former patriot employees common stock issued total purchase price assets acquired investments cash and cash equivalents other assets assets acquired other liabilities assumed net assets acquired preliminary gain on patriot acquisition the value of the shares of common stock exchanged with the patriot common shareholders was based upon the closing price of our common stock on december   the price immediately prior to the closing of the transaction 
the fair value of patriot s investments were determined by the board of directors in conjunction with an independent valuation agent 
this valuation resulted in a purchase price which was  below the amortized cost of such investments 
for those assets which are performing  prospect will record the accretion to par value in interest income over the remaining term of the investment 
the preliminary gain has been determined based upon the estimated value of certain liabilities which are not yet settled 
any changes to such accruals will be recorded in future periods as an adjustment to such gain 
we do not believe such adjustments will be material 
during the period from the acquisition of patriot on december  to june   we recognized  of interest income due to purchase discount accretion from the assets acquired from patriot 
included in this amount is  resulting from the acceleration of purchase discounts from the early repayments of four loans  two revolving lines of credit  sale of one investment position and restructuring of five loans

investment valuation our board of directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio 
these procedures are detailed below 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
for most of our investments  market quotations are not available 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with the independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors  the independent valuation firm conducts independent appraisals and makes their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firm and the audit committee 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc or codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted asc on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter ended september  asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by us at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
the changes to gaap from the application of asc relate to the definition of fair value  framework for measuring fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards 
in accordance with asc  the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted 
in april  the fasb issued asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly asc 
this update provides further clarification for asc in markets that are not active and provides additional guidance for determining when the volume of trading level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly

book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute or are not deemed to have distributed at least of our annual taxable income in the calendar year earned  we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual taxable income exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  we accrue excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
we adopted fasb asc  income taxes asc 
asc provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
asc requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of asc was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of asc did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits

loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment

table of contents investment valuation in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june  the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firm and from management having an aggregate range of  to  excluding money market investments 
in determining the range of value for debt instruments  management and the independent valuation firm generally shadow rated the investment and then based upon the range of ratings  determined appropriate yields to maturity for a loan rated as such 
a discounted cash flow analysis was then prepared using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate  yielding the ranges 
for equity investments  the enterprise value was determined by applying ebitda multiples for similar recent investment sales 
for stressed equity investments  a liquidation analysis was prepared 
the board of directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including recent operating and financial trends for the asset  independent ratings obtained from third parties and comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry 
the composite of all these analysis  applied to each investment  was a total valuation of  excluding money market investments 
our portfolio companies are generally lower middle market companies  outside of the financial sector  with less than  of annual ebitda 
we believe our market has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments 
during the year ended june   there has been a general improvement in the markets in which we operate  and market rates of interest negotiated for middle market loans have decreased 
control investments often offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in significant changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
a few of the control investments in our portfolio are discussed below 
ajax rolled ring machine  inc we acquired a controlling equity interest in ajax in a recapitalization of the company that was closed on april  we funded  of senior secured term debt   of subordinated term debt and  of equity as of that closing 
during the fiscal year ended june   we funded an additional  of secured subordinated debt to refinance a third party revolver provider and provide working capital 
as of june   we control of the fully diluted common and preferred equity 
ajax forges seamless steel rings sold to various customers 
the rings are used in a range of industrial applications  including in construction equipment and wind power turbines 
ajax s business is cyclical  and the business experienced a significant decline in the first half of in light of the global macroeconomic crisis 
the second half of and to date show steady improvement versus the first half of at june   ajax had a backlog of new business that would indicate continued improvement for the board of directors decreased the fair value of our investment in ajax to  as of june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized depreciation recorded at june  change clean energy holdings inc and change clean energy  inc  f k a worcester energy partners  inc change clean energy  inc ccei is an investment  that we originated in september  which owns and operated a biomass energy plant 
in march  ccei ceased operations  as the business became uneconomic based on the cost of materials and the price being received for the electricity generated 
during that quarter  we instituted foreclosure proceedings against the co borrowers of our debt 
in anticipation of such proceedings  ccehi was established 
on march   the foreclosure was completed and the assets were assigned to a wholly owned subsidiary of ccehi 
during the year ended june   we provided additional funding of to ccehi to fund ongoing operations 
ccei currently has no material operations 
at june  we determined that the impairment at both ccei and ccehi was other than temporary and recognized a realized loss of  which was the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the fair value 
at june   our board of directors  under recommendation from senior management  has set the value of the ccehi investment with no value  a reduction of  from its amortized cost after the recognized depreciation 

table of contents gas solutions holdings  inc gshi is an investment that we completed in september in which we own of the equity 
gshi is a midstream gathering and processing business located in east texas 
gshi has improved its operations and we have experienced an increase in revenue  gross margin  and ebitda the later two metrics on both an absolute and a percentage of revenues basis over the past five years 
during the past two years  we have held discussions with multiple interested purchasers for gas solutions 
while we wish to unlock the value in gas solutions  we do not wish to enter into any agreement at any time that does not recognize the long term value we see in gas solutions 
as a well hedged midstream asset  which we expect to generate recurring cash flows to us  gas solutions is a valuable asset that we wish to sell at a value maximizing price  or not at all 
in addition  a sale of the assets  rather than the stock of gshi  might result in a significant tax liability at the gshi level which would need to be paid prior to any distribution to us 
in february  we hired robert bourne as president and ceo of gas solutions 
mr 
bourne has over years of experience in the midstream sector  including gathering and processing  gas purchasing  storing and trading  producer services  and business development mergers and acquisitions 
he served most recently at energy transfer  where he managed houston pipeline  among other activities 
mr 
bourne is focusing on our upside plant projects and seeking new opportunities to help gas solutions grow beyond its existing footprint 
in april  gas solutions purchased a series of propane puts with strike prices of per gallon and per gallon covering the periods may   through april   and may   through april   respectively 
gas solutions hedged approximately of its current exposure to natural gas liquids based on current plant volumes 
these hedges will reduce the volatility on earnings associated with lower prices of natural gas liquids without limiting the upside from higher prices  helping gshi to continue to generate sufficient cash flow to make interest and dividend payments 
in determining the value of gshi  we have utilized two valuation techniques to determine the value of the investment 
our board of directors has determined the value to be  for our debt and equity positions at june  based upon a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a public comparables analysis 
at june  and june   gshi was valued  and  above its amortized cost  respectively 
integrated contract services  inc ics is an investment that we completed in april prior to january  ics owned the assets of esa environmental specialists  inc esa and of the stock of the healing staff ths 
esa originally defaulted under our contract governing our investment in esa  prompting us to commence foreclosure actions with respect to certain esa assets in respect of which we have a priority lien 
in response to our actions  esa filed voluntarily for reorganization under the bankruptcy code on august  on september   the us bankruptcy court approved a section asset sale from esa to us 
to complete this transaction  we contributed our esa debt to a newly formed entity  ics  and provided funds for working capital on october  in return for the esa debt  we received senior secured debt in ics of equal amount to our esa debt  preferred stock of ics  and of the ics common stock 
ics subsequently ceased operations and assigned the collateral back to us 
ics is in default of both payment and financial covenants 
during september and october  we provided  to ths for working capital 
in january  we foreclosed on the real and personal property of ics 
through this foreclosure process  we gained ownership of ths and certain esa assets 
based upon an analysis of the liquidation value of the esa assets and the enterprise value of ths  our board of directors determined the fair value of our investment in ics to be  at june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized loss recorded at june  
table of contents iron horse coiled tubing  inc iron horse is an investment that we completed in april iron horse had been a provider of coiled tubing subcontractor services prior to making a strategic decision in late to directly service natural gas and oil producers in the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb as a fracturing services provider 
as a result of the business transition  the company s financial performance declined significantly from levels 
iron horse completed its transition from a subcontractor to a direct service provider in  but natural gas prices declined to trough levels due to the recession and heightened natural gas inventory levels 
since november  iron horse has experienced increased activity in the wcsb and is now completing wells for several large producers in the wcsb 
prior to december   we owned of the common stock in iron horse 
on december   we received an additional of the common stock in iron horse  which increased our total ownership to 
through a series of subsequent loans that were used to construct equipment and facilitate the transition from a subcontractor to a direct service provider  we secured an additional of the common stock in iron horse in september  which increased our total ownership to of the common stock in iron horse 
effective january   we restructured our senior secured and bridge loans to iron horse and we reorganized iron horse s management structure 
our loans were replaced with three new tranches of senior secured debt and our total ownership of iron horse decreased to 
our equity ownership will incrementally decrease as debt tranches are repaid upon maturity 
there was no change to fair value at the time of restructuring  and we continue to fully reserve any income accrued for iron horse 
the board of directors wrote down the fair value of our investment in iron horse to  as of june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized depreciation recorded at june  manx energy  inc on january   we modified the terms of our senior secured debt in aeh and coalbed in conjunction with the formation of manx energy  a new entity consisting of the assets of aeh  coalbed and kinley exploration 
the assets of the three companies were combined under new common management 
we funded  at closing to manx to provide for working capital 
a portion of our loans to aeh and coalbed was exchanged for manx preferred equity  while our aeh equity interest was converted into manx common stock 
there was no change to fair value at the time of restructuring  and we continue to fully reserve any income accrued for manx 
the board of directors wrote down the fair value of our investment in manx to  as of june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized depreciation  for aeh and coalbed combined  recorded at june  yatesville coal holdings  inc all of our coal holdings have been consolidated under the yatesville entity 
yatesville delivered improved operating results after the consolidation of the coal holdings  but the company mined its permitted reserves in december and has not produced meaningful revenues since then 
we continue to evaluate strategies for yatesville  such as soliciting indications of interest regarding a transaction involving part or all of recoverable reserves 
during the year ended june   we provided additional funding of  to yatesville to fund ongoing operations  including new permitting 
during the quarter ended december   we discontinued operations at yatesville 
at december   our board of directors determined that  consistent with the decision to discontinue operations  the impairment of yatesville was other than temporary  and we recorded a realized loss of  which was the amount that the amortized cost exceeded the fair value at december  as of june   our board of directors set the value of the remaining yatesville investment at  which represents the residual value of recoverable reserves  a reduction of  from its value as of june  equity positions in the portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value  both increases as well as decreases  due to changes in operating results 
four control investments have experienced such volatility fischbein and gshi with improved operating results and nrg and r v with declining operating results 
nine of the remaining controlled investments have experienced operating challenges and have been valued at significant discounts to the original investment 

table of contents the affiliate investments continue to report strong operating results  with valuations increasing significantly for two investments subsequent to the acquisition of patriot boxercraft and sport helmets 
with the non control non affiliate investments  generally  there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control affiliate investments  and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments 
for debt investments  the fair value is limited on the high side to each loan s par value  plus any prepayment premia that could be imposed 
many of the debt investments in this category have not experienced a significant change in value  as they were previously valued at or near par value 
the exception to this categorization relates to investments which were acquired in the patriot acquisition  many of which were acquired at significant discounts to par value  and any changes in operating results or interest rates can have a significant effect on the value of such investments 
afi  copernicus group  impact products  llc  mac massey holdings  llc and prince experienced meaningful increases in valuations 
afi  deb shops  inc deb shops  h m and wind river resources corp 
and wind river ii corp 
wind river experienced decreases in valuations due to declines in their operating results 
shearer s completed a significant acquisition  which is driving the operating results and the increase in the value of the investment 
for one investment  miller petroleum  inc  we have held warrants in the company  and there has been a significant increase in the price per share of the company s stock  driving the increase in the value of our investment 
the remaining investments did not experience significant changes in operations or valuation 
during the year ended june   we restructured our loans to afi  exl  lhc  prince and rom 
the revised terms were more favorable than the original terms and increased the present value of the future cash flows 
the cost bases of the new loans were recorded at par value  which included  of accelerated original purchase discount recognized as interest income 
capitalization our investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business 
we capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity 
our debt is currently consists of a revolving credit facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations and our equity capital is currently comprised entirely of common equity 
on june   we completed a first closing on an expanded  syndicated revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility included an accordion feature which allowed the facility to accept up to an aggregate total of  of commitments for which we had  of commitments from six lenders when the facility was renegotiated 
the revolving period of the facility extended through june  with an additional one year amortization period after the completion of the revolving period 
on june   we closed an extension and expansion of our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the lenders have commitments of million under the new credit facility as of june  the new credit facility includes an accordion feature which allows the facility to be increased to up to million of commitments in the aggregate to the extent additional or existing lenders commit to increase the commitments 
we will seek to add additional lenders in order to reach the maximum size  although no assurance can be given we will be able to do so 
as we make additional investments which are eligible to be pledged under the credit facility  we will generate additional availability to the extent such investments are eligible to be placed into the borrowing base 
the revolving period of the credit facility extends through june  with an additional one year amortization period with distributions allowed after the completion of the revolving period 
during such one year amortization period  all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance 
at the end of the one year amortization period  the remaining balance will become due if required by the lenders 

table of contents as of june  and  we had  and  available to us for borrowing under our credit facility  of which  and  was outstanding  respectively 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility was one month libor plus basis points prior to june   increasing to one month libor plus basis points  subject to a minimum libor floor of basis points for the period from june  to june  and thereafter 
the maintenance of this facility requires us to pay a fee for the amount not drawn upon 
prior to june   this fee was assessed at the rate of basis points per annum of the amount of that unused portion 
for the period from june  to june   this rate increased to basis points per annum 
after june   the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either basis points if at least half of the credit facility is used or basis points otherwise

during the year ended june   we completed three stock offerings and raised  of additional equity by issuing  shares of our common stock below net asset value diluting shareholder value by per share

during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share primarily from the write downs of our investments in ccei and yatesville 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share primarily from the sales of our investments in advantage oilfield group and central illinois energy at a loss 

table of contents during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended june  and the fiscal year ended june   we have raised a significant amount of equity capital  which was used in part to fund the patriot acquisition  but has not yet been fully invested 
as a result  our use of the credit facility has been less during the fiscal year ended june  and the excess cash on hand tends to depress our earnings per share 
we continue to deploy our debt and equity raised into new investments 
to further illustrate the effects  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june   weighted average shares outstanding have increased from  to  or  while the average debt principal of investments increased from  to  or 
partially offsetting this effect on eps is the increase in the weighted interest rate earning on debt investments from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  while we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses  our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate 
these companies are typically not issuing securities rated investment grade  have limited resources  have limited operating history  have concentrated product lines or customers  are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents 
changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company 
investment income we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own  dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own  and amortized loan origination fees on the structuring of new deals 
our investments  if in the form of debt securities  will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
to the extent achievable  we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets 
we also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies  which may pay cash or in kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis 
in addition  we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned 
investment income  which consists of interest income  including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees  dividend income and other income  including settlement of net profits interests  overriding royalty interests and structuring fees  was   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the primary driver of the increase from fiscal to fiscal is the acquisition of additional assets from patriot and other new investments which increased interest income for the second half of the year 
this increase is partially offset by a decline in dividend income from gshi 
drivers of the increase from fiscal to fiscal include increased assets generating increased interest and dividend income along with increased income from royalty and settlement of net profits interests 
the following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  interest income dividend income other income total investment income average debt principal of investments weighted average interest rate earned 
table of contents total investment income has increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  investment income has been increasing as we continue to deploy the additional capital  raised in both debt and equity offerings  in revenue producing assets 
average interest income producing assets have increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the average yield on interest bearing assets increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase is primarily the result of higher interest rates earned on the assets acquired in the patriot acquisition including discount accretion 
average yields on interest bearing assets decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this decrease was the result of our increasing our asset mix in financings with private equity sponsors 
we believe that such financings offer less risk  and consequently lower yields  due  in part  to lesser risk to our capital resulting from larger equity at risk underneath our capital 
holding these types of investments has allowed us to more effectively utilize our credit facility to finance such assets at an average rate of  and for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
additionally  during the years ended june  and june   interest of  and  respectively  was foregone on non accrual debt investments compared to  of foregone interest for the year ended june  without these adjustments  the weighted average interest rates earned on debt investments would have been  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
investment income is also generated from dividends and other income 
dividend income grew significantly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  and declined to  for the year ended june  dividend income is mostly attributable to dividends received from our investment in gshi  which were  and  during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
other income has come primarily from structuring fees  overriding royalty interests  and settlement of net profits interests 
income from other sources grew from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  and decreased to  for the year ended june  during the year ended june  we received royalty income and settlement of net profits interest of  in the aggregate related to ken tex energy corp  and  of structuring fees related to ajax  h m and various other portfolio investments 
during the year ended june   structuring fees of  were received primarily related to biotronic and gshi  a decrease of  from the year ended june  the increase in other income for the year ended june  is largely due to the settlement of our net profit interests in iec ars for  during the year ended june  we recognized a  gain on the patriot acquisition and received  of structuring and amendment fees primarily related to exl  h m  hoffmaster and shearer s  an overall decrease of  in other income from the year ended june  operating expenses our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees base and incentive fees  credit facility costs  legal and professional fees and other operating and overhead related expenses 
these expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement with prospect administration under which prospect administration provides administrative services and facilities for us 
our investment advisory fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our administration agreement with prospect administration 
operating expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the base investment advisory expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
these increases are directly related to our growth in total assets 
  and  in income incentive fees were earned for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the increases have occurred as net interest income has increased due primarily to an increase in the asset base 
no capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the investment advisory agreement 

table of contents during the years ended june   june  and june   we incurred   and  respectively  of expenses related to our credit facilities 
these expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those years and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those years 
the table below describes the various credit facility expenses and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness 
year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs commitment and other fees total weighted average debt outstanding weighted average interest rate facility amount at beginning of year the increase in our interest rate incurred for the year ended june  is primarily due to an increase of basis points in our borrowing rate effective june  and the concurrent introduction of a libor floor at basis points 
this increase was partially amended on june  with the closing of our current facility 
the borrowing rate and libor floor decreased by basis points and basis points  respectively 
the decrease in our interest rate incurred for the year ended june  is primarily due to a decrease in average libor of approximately in comparison to for the year ended june  this decrease was partially offset by an increase of basis points in the then effective borrowing rate at november  as our asset base has grown and we have added complexity to our capital raising activities  due  in part  to our assumption of the sub administration role from vastardis  we have commensurately increased the size of our administrative and financial staff  accounting for a significant increase in the overhead allocation from prospect administration 
over the last two years  prospect administration has added several additional staff members  including a senior finance professional  a controller  three corporate counsels and other finance professionals 
as our portfolio continues to grow  we expect to continue to increase the size of our administrative and financial staff on a basis that provides increasing returns to scale 
however  initial investments in administrative and financial staff may not provide returns to scale immediately  perhaps not until the portfolio increases to a greater size 
other allocated expenses from prospect administration have  as expected  increased alongside with the increase in staffing and asset base 
total operating expenses  net of management fees and interest costs other operating expenses  were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in other operating expenses during the year ended june  when compared to the year ended june  is primarily the result operating efficiencies realized upon the termination of the sub administration agreement and no excise taxes being paid in offset by the costs incurred in connection with merger discussions with allied capital corporation expensed in the period 
at december   we elected to retain a portion of our annual taxable income and accrued for the excise tax that was paid with the filing of the return 
legal costs continue to decrease significantly from  for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  as there were reduced costs for litigation

net investment income represents the difference between investment income and operating expenses and is directly impacted by the items described above 
net realized losses gains were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the net realized loss during the year ended june  was due primarily to the determination that yatesville was other than temporarily impaired and recognized a realized loss for the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the current fair value 
on june   we determined that the impairment of the ccehi investment was other than temporarily impaired and recognized a realized loss for the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the current fair value 
this loss was partially offset by realized gains from sales of the arctic warrants and deep down common stock 
the net realized loss of  sustained in the year ended june  was due mainly to the sale of charlevoix and advantage oilfield group ltd
