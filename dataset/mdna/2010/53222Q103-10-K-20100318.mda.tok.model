about the company the company is one of north america s leading resources for nationally branded food preparation  tabletop and home d cor products 
the company s three major product categories are food preparation  tabletop and home d cor 
the company markets several product lines within each of these product categories and under each of the company s brands  primarily targeting moderate to premium price points  through every major level of trade 
the company s competitive advantage is based on availability and use of its brands  an emphasis on innovation and new product development and sourcing capabilities 
the company owns or licenses a number of the leading brands in its industry including farberware  kitchenaid  cuisinart  pfaltzgraff and mikasa 
historically  the company  s sales growth has come from expanding product offerings within the company s current categories by developing existing brands  and acquiring new brands and product categories 
key factors in the company s growth strategy have been  and will continue to be  the selective use and management of the company s brands  and the company s ability to provide a stream of new products and designs 
a significant element of this strategy is the company s in house design and development team that creates new products  packaging and merchandising concepts 
effects of the current economic environment sales of the company s products declined in and as a result of the global economic recession that began in late in addition  in  retailers generally decreased overall stock keeping levels  resulting in lower inventory replenishment 
while there are signs that a moderate economic recovery currently is underway  the company believes that sustainable increases in the demand for its products will not occur until employment levels improve from current levels 
a deterioration of economic conditions likely would have an adverse impact on the company s sales 
business segments the company operates in two reportable business segments  the wholesale segment which is the company s primary business that designs  markets and distributes its products to retailers and distributors  and the direct to consumer segment  through its pfaltzgraff  mikasa and lifetime sterling internet websites and pfaltzgraff mail order catalogs

mx 
the company accounts for its investment in vasconia using the equity method of accounting and has recorded its proportionate share of vasconia s net income for the years ended and  net of taxes  as equity in earnings of grupo vasconia  sab in the company s statement of operations 
inventory reduction plan the company has had an inventory reduction plan in effect since the plan includes reducing the number of individual items offered for sale and to shorten the period between inventory procurement and sale to the customer 
consistent with this plan  the company has been selling slower moving inventory at lower than regular gross margin levels 
the plan was developed to increase efficiency by reducing the capital invested in inventory and substantially reducing third party warehousing and related expenses 
the plan has  in certain cases  negatively impacted the company s gross margins and may negatively impact the company s gross margins in the future 
the company believes this plan has been successful and it expects to continue its inventory reduction efforts for the foreseeab le future

the restructuring charges in also reflect adjustments to the restructuring charges recognized in as the result of decisions by the company not to vacate certain leased space that the company had expected to vacate and a decision not to terminate the employment of certain employees  whose employment the company had expected to terminate 
the company s restructuring efforts are substantially complete and the company does not expect any significant restructuring charges in the foreseeable future

for this purpose  the company concluded that the migration of sales from the retail outlet stores to the internet  catalog and wholesale businesses of greater than would be significant

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and with the instructions to form k and article of regulation s x 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other fac tors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances and customer chargebacks  inventory mark down provisions  impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill  stock option expense  derivative valuation and accruals related to the company s tax positions 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions and under different conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third party suppliers 
inventory also includes finished goods  work in process and raw materials related to the company s manufacture of sterling silver products 
inventory is priced by the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
the company estimates the selling price of its inventory on a product by product basis based on the current selling environment and considering the various available channels of distribution eg wholesale specialty store  off price retailers etc 
or the internet and catalog 
if the estimated selling price is lower than the inventory s cost  the company reduces the value of inventory to the estimated selling price 
if the company is inaccurate in its estimates of selling prices  it could repor t material fluctuations in gross margin 
historically  the company s adjustments to inventory have been appropriate and have not resulted in material unexpected charges 
receivables the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the initial and on going creditworthiness of the company s customers 
the company also maintains an allowance for anticipated customer deductions 
the allowances for deductions are primarily based on contracts the company has with its customers 
however  in certain cases the company does not have a formal contract and or customer deductions are non contractual 
to evaluate the reasonableness of non contractual customer deductions  the company analyzes currently available in formation and historical trends of deductions 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or sell the company s products at reasonable sales prices  or the company s estimate of non contractual deductions was determined to be inaccurate  revisions to allowances may be required  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
historically  the company s allowances have been appropriate and have not resulted in material unexpected charges 
intangible assets and long lived assets intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are subject to an annual impairment assessment in accordance with the provisions of asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
based on the results of the company s assessment  no impairment of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets was identified for the year ended december  long lived assets  including intangible assets deemed to have finite lives  are reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic no 
 property  plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may have been impaired 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
when impairment indicators are present  the company compares the carrying value of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recog nized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the company considered indicators of impairment of its long lived assets and determined that no such indicators were present at december  revenue recognition the company sells products wholesale  to retailers and distributors  and retail  direct to the consumer through the company s factory and outlet store  catalog and internet operations 
wholesale sales are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
the retail store sales in were recognized at the time of sale 
catalog and internet sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities 
employee stock options the company accounts for its stock options in accordance with asc topic no 
 awards classified as equity  which requires the measurement of compensation expense for all share based compensation granted to employees and non employee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the related service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility of the company s common stock 
changes in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of the c ompany s stock options 
income taxes the company applies the provisions of asc topic no 
 income taxes  for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the company s financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken 
derivatives the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedges and have been designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes have no net impact on earnings to the extent the derivative is considered perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes  changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are i cash provided by operating activities and ii borrowings available under the credit facility 
the company s primary uses of funds consist of working capital requirements  capital expenditures and payment of principal and interest on its debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to million at december   working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  and the current ratio was to at december  compared to to at december  borrowings under the company s credit facility decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in cash from operations that was used to pay down the amounts outstanding under the credit facility due to the company s inventory reduction efforts  receipt of an income tax refund  reduction of discretionary expenses and other expense reduction efforts 
the company believes that availability under the credit facility and cash flows from operations is sufficient to fund the company s operations 
however  due to the tightening of the credit markets  the company believes that if needed other available sources of liquidity could be limited 
if circumstances were to adversely change  the company would seek to improve its liquidity by taking actions such as to further lower its inventory and reduce expenses 
however  there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or that the results of any such efforts would be adequate 
finally  the combined effects of the economic downturn and credit crisis have had a significant impact on the company s retail partners and in certain cases resulted in bankruptcies and eventual liquidation 
the company closely monitors the creditworthiness of its customers 
based upon the evaluation of changes in customers creditworthiness  the company may modify credit limits and or terms of sale 
the company has not been materially affected by the bankruptcy or liquidation of any of its customers to date 
however  notwithstanding the company s efforts to monitor its customers financial condition  the company may be materially affected in the future 
in  wal mart stores  inc including sam s club accounted for of the company s sales 
a material reduction of product orders by wal mart stores  inc could have significant adverse effects on the company s business and operating results and ultimately the company s liquidity  including the loss of predictability and volume production efficiencies associated with such a large customer
