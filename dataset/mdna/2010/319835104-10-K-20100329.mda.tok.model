item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview first community corporation is a one bank holding company headquartered in lexington  south carolina 
we operate from our main office in lexington  south carolina and our full service offices located in lexington two  forest acres  irmo  cayce west columbia  gilbert  chapin  northeast columbia  prosperity  newberry and camden 
during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of dekalb bankshares  inc  the holding company for the bank of camden 
the merger added one office in kershaw county located in the midlands of south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first acquisition of another financial institution when we merged with dutchfork bancshares  inc  the holding company for newberry federal savings bank 
the merger added three offices in newberry county 
in  our college street office in newberry was consolidated with our wilson road office in newberry 
we engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision making  emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium sized businesses  professional concerns and individuals 
the following discussion describes our results of operations for as compared to and as compared to  and also analyzes our financial condition as of december  as compared to december  like most community banks  we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
a primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during  and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the years shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this noninterest income  as well as our noninterest expense  in the following discussion 
the discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report 

table of contents on october   the treasury announced the cpp under the eesa  pursuant to which the treasury could make senior preferred stock investments in participating financial institutions that qualifies as tier i capital 
based on our risk weighted assets as of september   we were eligible to issue up to million in new senior preferred stock under the program 
on november   as part of the cpp established by the treasury under the eesa  first community corporation entered into the cpp purchase agreement with the treasury dated november  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the treasury i the series t preferred stock and ii the cpp warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the proceeds from this offering qualify as tier capital under the regulatory capital guidelines 
cumulative dividends on the series t preferred stock accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but will be paid only if  as  and when declared by the company s board of directors 
the series t preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company 
the series t preferred stock generally is non voting 
under the terms of the agreement the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par after february  prior to this date  the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par if i the company has raised aggregate gross proceeds in one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the cpp purchase agreement in excess of approximately million  and ii the aggregate redemption price does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds from such qualified equity offerings 
the recovery act signed by the president on february  amended the terms of the agreement and allows the company to redeem the series t preferred stock prior to february  any redemption is subject to the consent of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  the impact of current events  and conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management s estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation and recognition of other than temporary impairment otti on certain investments including our private label mortgage backed securities and other corporate debt security 
table of contents holdings requires significant judgment and estimates 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the evaluation of otti include projected cash flows including prepayment assumptions  default rates and severities of losses on the underlying collateral within the security 
under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions  the actual otti recognized by us may be different from the actual amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for the disclosure of certain of the assumptions used as well as otti recognized in the financial statements during the years ended december  and results of operations our net loss was million  or diluted loss per share  for the year ended december   as compared to net loss of million  or diluted loss per common share  for the year ended december   and million  or diluted earnings per common share  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or per diluted share  that represents the complete write off of our goodwill intangible 
goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
we annually conduct a test during our third quarter to assess fair value in the current economic environment  as compared to the value determined at the time of acquisition 
the third quarter analysis and valuation process resulted in our determination that goodwill was impaired 
this determination is reflective of the impact of the current economic environment and its effect on the banking industry and our company 
the calculation of fair value as part of the goodwill impairment test is subject to significant management judgment and estimates 
industry wide  market capitalization and acquisition multiples have significantly declined since and  which are the dates of the acquisition of dutchfork bankshares and dekalb bancshares  respectively 
our company has experienced the same trend  with a decline in its market price per share and an extended period of time trading at a discount to book value and tangible book value 
this non cash charge is the accounting recognition of these events 
given the non cash nature of a goodwill charge  this non interest expense item has no adverse impact upon our regulatory capital  liquidity position  operating performance or our prospects for future earnings 
there is no tax benefit recognized as a result of this goodwill impairment charge 
the net loss for the year ended december  included a charge to recognize an otti in the amount of million on our investment in a preferred stock issue of freddie mac a gse reflecting a write down of substantially all of its carrying value 
during the second quarter of  we made a decision to recognize an unrealized mark to market loss on the security that at that time was rated investment grade in the amount of million as an otti based on the significant decline in the market value of the security caused by potential deterioration of freddie mac s financial condition  and the then current lack of clarity about the impact of an announced plan which was approved by the house and senate and signed into law by the president 
that plan provided support for freddie mac as well as other gses 
on september   the secretary of the treasury announced a decision to place freddie mac into conservatorship and as part of that decision the dividend payments on existing preferred shares would be terminated for an unspecified period of time 
as a result of that decision we took an additional million otti charge in the third quarter of to write off substantially all of the remaining investment in this freddie mac security 
the preferred stock issue was purchased in and acquired by first community corporation in the merger with dutchfork bankshares 
the security with a current cost basis of  is included in the available for sale securities portfolio 
another significant decision that impacted our results for the years ended december  and was the implementation of a leverage strategy  during the second quarter of  whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
we initiated this strategy because we believed the pricing levels of these securities and related funding opportunities provided the ability to realize significant spread not typically available in leverage strategies 
the weighted average 
table of contents yield on the investment securities purchased was approximately 
all of the mortgage assets acquired were classified as prime or alt a securities and represent the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy have been classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
the securities were acquired on the open market through securities dealers 
prior to initiating each transaction  we performed a thorough analysis  evaluating the associated credit risk  interest rate risk  liquidity and capital risk as well as related funding options 
we continue to perform an evaluation of these securities and the related risk on a monthly basis 
the funding for this strategy was provided through federal home loan bank advances in the amount of million and brokered certificate of deposits in the amount of million 
the weighted average cost of funding was approximately 
as discussed later under the caption investments and in note to the financial statements  these investments as well as other private label mortgage backed securities plmbss owned previously have come under significant stress due to high delinquencies and default rates occurring in the underlying collateral 
as a result  many plmbss  including those we own  have been downgraded by rating agencies below investment grade 
we have established a comprehensive monitoring process to identify and record losses related to other than temporary impairment on our entire private label mortgage backed securities portfolio 
as noted above in item under reconciliations  our operating earnings were million  or per diluted common share  for as compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share  for net interest income increased by thousand in from million in to million in the increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the level of average earning assets

net interest income net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the yield on earning assets was   and in  and  respectively 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was   and in  and  respectively 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was in  in and in our loan to deposit ratio on average during was  as compared to during and during loans typically provide a higher yield than other types of earning assets and thus one of our goals continues to be to grow the loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets which should improve the overall yield on earning assets and the net interest margin 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio was 
the net interest margin declined in as compared to and in compared to starting in early and throughout interest rates have been at historic lows 
the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and our cost of funds decreased by basis points in as compared to this resulted in an increase in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to despite this  our net interest margin decreased basis points as a slightly higher percentage of our average earning assets volume were funded by interest bearing liabilities volume in as compared to in addition  a slight change in the mix of funding sources contributed to the decline in our margin between the two periods 
throughout  time deposits and borrowed funds represented of our total interest bearing funding sources and in these balances represented of our interest bearing funding sources 
these sources of funding are typically higher cost funds than alternative sources 
in comparing to  the net interest spread increased by basis points but the net interest margin decreased by basis points 
the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points in as compared to the cost of interest bearing funds decreased by basis points during the same period 
the average borrowed funds to total interest bearing liabilities in was  as compared to in longer term borrowed funds typically have a higher interest rate than our mix of deposit products 
as explained above  the increase in the level of interest bearing deposits supporting the earning assets  as well as the change in the mix of these deposits  resulted in the decrease in the net interest margin between the two periods 
average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following table depicts  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average

the risk of loss can be measured in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
we have established an asset liability management committee alco to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the alco monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the alco has established policies guidelines and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
a monitoring technique employed by us is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
also  asset liability modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
neither the gap analysis or asset liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income including  the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement on october  the swap agreement has a million notional amount 
we receive a variable rate of interest on the notional amount based on a three month libor rate and pay a fixed rate interest of 
the contract was entered into to protect us from the negative impact of rising interest rates 
our exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
our exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the changes in the market value of the swap between reporting periods 
at december  and the fair value of the contract was a negative thousand and thousand  respectively 
the fair value adjustment during each reporting period is recognized in other income 
for the years ended december  and the adjustment reflected in earnings amounted to thousand and  respectively 
the fair value of the contract is the present value  over the remaining term of the contract  of the difference between the estimated swap rate  for the remaining term  as the reporting date multiplied by the notional amount and the fixed interest rate of multiplied by the notional amount of the contract 
at december   we had an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the cap rate of interest is three month libor 
the cap agreement expired on august  and at december  the agreement had no value 
at december  the company had floor agreement with a notional amount of million 
the floor was sold in the first 
table of contents quarter of and the company received thousand in cash and recognized a gain in the amount of thousand in other income 
these agreements are entered into to protect assets and liabilities from the negative effects of volatility in interest rates 
the agreements provide for a payment to the bank of the difference between the cap floor rate of interest and the market rate of interest 
the bank s exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
the bank s exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the market value of the cap and floor 
gains or losses on the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings on a current basis 
the bank received payments under the terms of the cap contract in the amounts of thousand and thousand during the years ended december  and  respectively 
no payments were received under the terms of the floor contract in the bank recognized thousand and thousand  in other income to reflect the increase in the value of the contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
through simulation modeling  we monitor the effect that an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points and basis points up and down will have on net interest income over the next months 
based on the many factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates  the following table estimates the hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december  and over the subsequent months 
even though we are liability sensitive  the model at december  reflects a decrease in net interest income in a basis point declining rate environment 
this primarily results from the current level of interest rates being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts 
the interest rates on these accounts are at a level where they cannot be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates 
the increase and decrease of and basis points assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity hypothetical percentage change in net interest income december  change in short term interest rates bp bp flat bp bp we also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the present value of equity pve over a range of changes in market interest rates 
the sensitivity of pve to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon 
at december  and  the pve exposure in a plus basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be and  respectively 
we are currently attempting to reduce our current increase in the pve exposure by shortening the lives or repricing periods of our earning assets as well as extending the length of repricing periods on our interest bearing liabilities 
our current modeling reflects an increase in net interest income over both the one year and two year time horizon 
as a result  we believe this somewhat compensates for the negative exposure to pve in a rising rate and provides sufficient time to adjust our balance sheet to reduce the longer term exposure to rising rates 

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  our provision for loan loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans  the quality  mix  and size of our overall loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans  our historical loan loss experience  and a review of specific problem loans 
we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures  changes in the local national economy  changes in volume or type of credits  changes in volume severity of problem loans  quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit 
periodically  we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period  especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in our market areas 
we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification 
the allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance 
the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
the substantial increase in the provision for as compared to the prior two years is a direct result of the ongoing economic downturn experienced throughout our markets and the country 
real estate values have been dramatically impacted during this economic cycle 
with our loan portfolio consisting of a large percentage of real estate secured loans we  like most financial institutions  have experienced increasing delinquencies and problem loans 
we are not immune to the continued effects of the recessionary economy and continue to experience some deterioration of our loan portfolio in general as evidenced by the increase in non performing assets from million basis points of total assets at december  to million basis points of total assets at december  while we believe these rates remain favorable in comparison to current industry results  we are concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local businesses and professionals 
our company has a significant portion of its loan portfolio with real estate as the underlying collateral 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio had real estate collateral as compared to approximately at december  see note to financial statements for concentrations of credit 
when loans  whether commercial or personal  are granted  they are based on the borrower s ability to generate repayment cash flows from income sources sufficient to service the debt 
real estate is generally taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment and as a secondary source of repayment 
during this economic cycle many borrowers traditional income sources have been impacted significantly and real estate values have dropped significantly 
we will continue to work closely with all our borrowers that are experiencing economic problems as a result of this cycle and believe we have the processes in place to monitor and identify problem credits 
until this economic cycle reverses we are likely to continue to experience higher than historical delinquencies and problem loans 
therefore  
table of contents we anticipate funding our provision for loan losses at levels higher than we have historically experienced 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allowance is also subject to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december    and  we had non accrual loans in the amount of million  million and thousand  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of loans 
the loans range in size from thousand to million and are substantially all real estate related 
we have reappraised the collateral on each of these loans and have written them down to their estimated fair value 
it is not anticipated that we will incur any additional material losses on these loans 
there were million  million  and thousand in loans delinquent to days at december   and  respectively 
there were million  thousand and thousand in loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing interest at december   and  respectively 
our management continuously monitors non performing  classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition of these loans 
we have identified loans in the amount of million which are current as to principal and interest at december  and not included in non performing assets but that could be potential problem loans 
each of these loans are real estate related and range in size from thousand to thousand 
they have been identified as potential problems based on our review that their traditional sources of cash flow have been impacted significantly and they may ultimately not be able to service the debt 
these loans are continually monitored and are considered in our overall evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses

table of contents the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each of the past five years

a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest  which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid  is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
our primary source of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts 
in addition  we originate mortgage loans that are pre sold and funded by the third party acquirer  for which we receive a fee 
other sources of noninterest income are derived from investment advisory fees and commissions on non deposit investment products  bankcard fees  atm debit card fees  commissions on check sales  safe deposit box rent  wire transfer and official check fees 
as a result of the otti charge  discussed previously  we had a non interest income loss during of million 
operating non interest income for was million see reconciliation above as compared to million in and million during deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to this decrease in deposit service charges resulted from a continued decline in overdraft fees in as compared to in  we realized gains on the sale of securities in the amount of million 
this gain was partially offset by a thousand loss on the early extinguishment of certain federal home loan bank advances 
we sold approximately million in investments in the fourth quarter to fund the early extinguishment of million in advances 
the balance of the payoff was funded from short term overnight funds 
the gain on the sale of the investments offset the loss on the paydown of the advances 
other gains realized throughout were realized to take advantage of favorable spreads on certain available for sale securities and shorten the leverage life of the portfolio 
mortgage origination fees increased by thousand in as compared to continued low interest rates as well as tax credits available to new home buyers 
table of contents have increased the volume of loans closed in as compared to there are also fewer mortgage origination alternatives available now as compared to a couple of years ago due to the current economic cycle causing many origination businesses to close 
otti charges in included the write off of a thousand investment in stock of silverton bank na  which was closed by the occ in may in addition  we realized thousand in otti charges on different plmbss 
the thousand represents the realized credit loss associated with the securities see note to the financial statements 
adjustment to assets and liabilities carried at fair value had a negative impact on non interest income of thousand in whereas it had a positive impact of thousand in see note to financial statements 
other noninterest income increased by thousand in as compared to the increase primarily related to modest increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees  loan late charges as well as other miscellaneous fees 
operating noninterest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for  a decrease of thousand  or 
deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to the decrease is a result of fewer items being presented for payment on insufficient funds and as discussed above this trend continued into mortgage origination fees increased by thousand  or  in as compared to this was a result of a low interest rate environment and a high level of refinancing 
commissions on the sale of non deposit products were relatively stable between as compared to on september   we completed the acquisition of two financial planning and investment advisory firms 
these firms had combined assets under management of approximately million 
this new division  first community financial consultants  combined the investment services unit already in place at first community with the added capabilities of holistic financial planning and investment advisory services 
this line of business is consistent with our vision to be a provider of financial solutions to local businesses  entrepreneurs  and professionals 
the activity in this division was slowed in the fourth quarter of as we integrated the acquisition of two firms 
fair value adjustments had a negative impact of thousand on noninterest income in and a positive impact of thousand in this decline in primarily relates to a year interest rate swap agreement entered into in november to protect against a rising rate environment see market risk and interest rate sensitivity section above 
the interest rate swap contract value decreased by approximately thousand at year end  due to a decrease in the overall interest rate environment 
other noninterest income increased by thousand in as compared to the increase primarily related to continued increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees as a result of continued increased usage by our customer base 
noninterest expense 
in the very competitive financial services industry  we recognize the need to place a great deal of emphasis on expense management and continually evaluate and monitor growth in discretionary expense categories in order to control future increases 
during the third quarter of we recognized an impairment charge of million related to goodwill acquired in previous acquisitions see discussion above under results of operations 
operating noninterest expense increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefit expense of thousand and an increase in fdic fico premiums of thousand in as compared to our full time employee equivalent count at december  decreased to from at december  several of these are unfilled positions that were vacated at year end and the balance represents the reduction of approximately positions we were able to reduce as result of converting to item branch capture 
these positions were reduced also near the end of the overall increase in salary and benefits primarily related to normal increases in salaries and a modest increase in our cost of medical insurance provided to employees 
the fdic fico premiums increase resulted from significant increases in the normal assessment rates implemented by the fdic as well as a special assessment in the third quarter of in the amount of approximately thousand 
it is anticipated that the assessments will rise in and there is a possibility of continued additional special assessments 
at december  we were required to 
table of contents prepay the fdic assessments for a three year period 
this prepayment was approximately million 
over the next three years the fdic will make adjustments quarterly for changes in the rate as well as changes in the assessment base 
professional fees and other noninterest expense increased by thousand and thousand  respectively  in as compared to these increases are primarily related to additional cost related to loan collection efforts as well as legal fees associated with loan workouts and general increases related to the many issues facing the industry during these economic times 
it is anticipated that these fees will remain elevated for the securities and exchange commission has granted an extension for the independent attestation report on internal controls until december  there will be increased cost incurred relative to complying with the requirements of section into and beyond 
the independent attestation report required for is anticipated to increase our professional fees by thousand to thousand in these noninterest expense increases were partially offset by a thousand decrease in marketing and advertising expense 
this decrease was a result of our intentional reduction in this discretionary expense during this economic cycle 
noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased thousand in as compared to we added approximately full time equivalent employees in for a total ftes at december  these additions were support personnel in audit  information technology  deposit sales  training and loan operations 
in addition  the acquisition of the two investment firms in the third quarter added three employees 
marketing expenses increased as a result of planned increases in television marketing in as compared to fdic assessments increased from thousand in to thousand in in  we had a credit toward fdic premiums as a result of our dutchfork acquisition in this credit ran out in march of and thereafter we were assessed the full fee 
professional fees increased by thousand in as compared to this primarily results from legal fees associated with increased collection efforts as well as legal fees related securities issues and new legislation 
amortization of intangibles decreased approximately thousand  which resulted from the core deposit premium associated with the acquisition of a branch office in

a valuation allowance is then established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
in  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance of thousand primarily related to contribution carryforwards that will expire at the end of there was also a valuation allowance of thousand at december  primarily related to contribution carry forwards that will expire 
there were no valuation allowances established for deferred taxes as of december  the loss generated during was a result of the impairment of goodwill acquired in tax free acquisitions and therefore is not deductible for income tax purposes 
as previously discussed we had an otti charge on certain securities of million during the loss is not deductible for federal income tax purposes until the securities are sold or deemed worthless 
therefore  the loss resulted in recognizing a deferred tax asset in the amount of million 
the net operating loss carryforward period for federal income taxes is generally years 
any carry forward period related to realize tax losses on these securities will not start until they are sold or deemed worthless 
we have a net operating loss carry forward acquired in the acquisition of dutchfork and dekalb for federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income through see note to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the tax expense benefit 
it is anticipated that our effective tax rate for will be between and 

table of contents financial position total assets at december  were million as compared to million at december  average earning assets increased to million during from million during the decline in assets between december  and december  resulted from the goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of as well as the payoff of million in fhlb advances in the fourth quarter of loans grew million  or  during loans at december  were million as compared to million at december  investment securities were at december  as compared to million at december  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased by million from million at december  to thousand at december  the increase in loans was funded by an increase in deposits of million from million at december  to million at december  the funding of the repayment of the million in fhlb advances was accomplished through the sale of approximately million in available for sale securities and short term overnight advances 
to the extent sources of funds from deposit growth and investment maturities have exceeded our loan growth we have increased our short term liquidity primarily by increasing our funds on deposit with the federal reserve bank of richmond 
shareholders equity totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  as previously discussed  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of which was the reason we recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
the net loss along with dividend payments on common and preferred stock resulted in retained earnings decreasing to a deficit of million as of december  as compared to retained earnings of million at december  earning assets loans 
loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
during  loans accounted for of average earning assets as compared to of average earning assets in the growth of the loan portfolio both in total dollars as well as a percentage of total earning assets continues to be a strategic focus into and thereafter 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks  which we attempt to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million during  as compared to million in a goal of the cpp program  which we participated in  was to provide funds capital to financial institutions to assist in unfreezing the credit markets 
one of our goals as a community bank has  and continues to be  to grow our assets through quality loan growth by providing credit to small and mid size businesses  as well as individuals within the markets we serve 
in  we funded new loans of approximately million 
in  our loan portfolio grew by approximately million 
loan production and portfolio growth rates continue to be impacted by the current economic recession  as borrowers are less inclined to leverage their corporate and personal balance sheets 
however  we remain committed to meeting the credit needs of our local markets 
a continuation of the recessionary national and local economic conditions as well as deterioration of asset quality within our company could significantly impact our ability to grow our loan portfolio 
significant increases in regulatory capital expectations beyond the traditional well capitalized ratios  significantly increased regulatory burdens as well as increasing fdic assessments will impede our ability to leverage our balance sheet and expand the loan portfolio 

table of contents the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category december  in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction mortgage residential mortgage commercial consumer total gross loans allowance for loan losses total net loans in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
we follow the common practice of financial institutions in the company s market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan components 
generally  we limit the loan to value ratio to 
the principal components of our loan portfolio at year end and were commercial mortgage loans in the amount of million and million  representing and of the portfolio  respectively 
significant portions of these commercial mortgage loans are made to finance owner occupied real estate 
we continue to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding our underwriting guidelines  and believe it will reduce the risk elements of the loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is a source of liquidity 
the following table sets forth the loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction all other loan loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating interest rates the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 

table of contents investment securities the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  as compared to million in this represents and of the average earning assets for the year ended december  and  respectively 
at december  and our investment securities portfolio amounted to million and million  respectively 
throughout and the bond markets and many institutional holders of bonds have come under a great deal of stress partially as a result of increasing delinquencies in the sub prime mortgage lending market 
as of december   we own total mbss and cmos with a book value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
these included securities with a book value million and approximate fair value of million issued by gses 
the current economic recessionary cycle has impacted mbss issued by gses  such as fhlmc and fnma 
the result has been increased spreads on these investments 
these entities have also experienced increasing delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the mbss and cmos 
as of december  and all of the mbss issued by gses are classified as available for sale 
unrealized losses on certain of these investments are not considered to be other than temporary and we have the intent and ability to hold these until they mature or recover the current book value 
the contractual cash flows of the investments are guaranteed by the gse 
accordingly  it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than our amortized cost 
also included in our mbs and cmo portfolio are plmbss with a book value of million and approximate fair value of million at december  although these are not classified as sub prime obligations or considered the high risk tranches  the majority of structured investments within all credit markets have been impacted by volatility and credit concerns and economic stresses throughout and the result has been that the market for these investments has become less liquid and the spread as compared to alternative investments widened dramatically 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a leverage strategy whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
all of the mortgage assets acquired in this transaction were classified as prime or alt a securities and represent the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy were classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
due to the significant spreads on these securities  they were all purchased at discounts 
a detailed analysis of each of the cmo pools included in this leverage transaction as well as privately held cmos held previously in the available for sale portfolio have been analyzed by reviewing underlying loan delinquencies  collateral value and resulting credit support 
starting in early  many of these securities acquired in the leverage strategy  as well as others that were owned prior to  began to be downgraded by the various rating agencies  and subsequently  cusips have been downgraded below investment grade 
we perform an internal detailed analysis on each cusip on at least a quarterly basis 
our internal analysis includes stressing each security using various assumptions for conditional default rate cdr  prepayment speeds cpr and severities of loss on underlying collateral once it is liquidated 
in addition  we have a third party perform an analysis of each security to validate our assumptions 
because the third party that runs stresses on a monthly basis initially sold us some of the securities in the portfolio  we have also engaged an independent third party to assist with evaluating and stressing each of the securities that have been downgraded below investment grade 
our analysis to evaluate the credit loss component of the impairment includes stressing the expected cash flows using the average cpr  cdrs and severities over the last six months 
each cusip is reviewed and if circumstances indicate that a shorter time frame is appropriate because cdrs and severities are rapidly increasing  we will adjust these assumptions 
we have incurred impairment charges on five plmbs investments whereby the credit component was thousand recognized through earnings and amount recognized through other comprehensive income amounted to million for the year ended december  see note to 
table of contents the financial statements 
two of these investments are held in our available for sale portfolio and three are in the held to maturity portfolio 
substantially all plmbs s continue to experience high levels of delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the plmbss  and as a result we could experience additional otti in the future 
the following table summarizes the plmbss portfolio by credit rating 
the rating reflects the lowest rating by any major rating agency 
number of cusip s amortized cost fair value dollars in thousands credit rating aaa aa a baa below investment grade total in our opinion the current rating system does not properly reflect the overall risk in these types of multi obligor bonds 
generally  they are rated below investment grade when there is a projected loss of a level of principal based on the par value of the bond 
the process does not consider what the holder paid for the bond or the impact that they are multi obligor securities 
this can cause an entire security to be rated below investment grade even though a majority of the underlying obligors are paying timely on the underlying obligation 
we believe that the robust internal and independent external monitoring process that we have in place allows us to properly evaluate the credit risk underlying these securities and record further otti in a timely manner 
we also hold corporate bonds and other securities with a book value of million and fair value of million as of december  the unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to bonds with seven different issuers 
all of these bonds are carried in the available for sale portfolio 
the economic conditions throughout and have had a significant impact on all corporate debt obligations 
as a result  the spreads on all of these securities have widened dramatically and the liquidity of many of these investments has been negatively impacted 
each of these bonds is rated bbb investment grade or better s p with the exception of four bonds downgraded during the last months 
one downgraded investment is rated cc by fitch and ca by moody s and is a preferred term security with a book value of million and fair value of thousand 
the second and third bonds are collateralized debt obligations cdos 
one is rated ccc by s p  with a carrying value of thousand and fair value of thousand 
this bond matures in december the other is rated ccc by s p and b by moody and has a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
the fourth bond is rated bbb by s p and ba by moody with a carrying value of thousand and a fair value of thousand 
all of the corporate bonds held by the company are reviewed on a quarterly basis to identify downgrades by rating agencies as well as deterioration of the underlying collateral or in the issuer s ability to service the debt obligation 
for corporate debt securities  we review the underlying issuer s credit quality  additional underlying credit support  and the length of maturity of the bond 
if our analysis determines that it is likely we will recover all of the projected cash flows  we do not deem the security to be otti 
during  we took otti on one security in the amount of thousand 
this security was an investment in common stock of silverton bank  na that was closed by the occ in may during the year ended  we took an otti charge related to certain securities including million on fhlmc preferred stock see results of operations  and thousand on a plmbs

core deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
included in time deposits less than  are brokered deposits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
as previously discussed we partially funded the leverage transaction with million in brokered cds 
all of these brokered cds are callable by us on a quarterly basis although we paid a slightly higher cost on these deposits it gives us the flexibility to call the cds in the event the asset side of the transaction prepays faster than anticipated as well as the ability to refinance them if rates decline 
due to pay downs on the assets funded by the brokered deposits in the leverage strategy  we called million of these deposits in the fourth quarter of a stable base of deposits is expected to continue be the primary source of funding to meet both our short term and long term liquidity needs in the future 
the maturity distribution of time deposits is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposit of  or more december  in thousands within three months after three through six months after six through twelve months after twelve months total certificates of deposit of  or more there were no other time deposits of  or more at december  large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposits obtained through brokers 
except for the leverage transaction previously discussed we have not funded our balance sheet by utilizing brokered deposits since they can be unreliable as long term funding sources 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances and long term debt as a result of issuing million in trust preferred securities

dividends were paid in at a rate of per share in the first quarter and per share for the remaining three quarters 
preferred dividends of were paid during the year ended december  on the preferred stock issued under the cpp plan 
a dividend reinvestment plan was implemented in the third quarter of the plan allows existing shareholders the option of reinvesting cash dividends as well as making optional purchases of up to  in the purchase of common stock per quarter 
we pay cash dividends to shareholders from funds provided mainly by dividends received from our bank 
dividends paid by our bank are subject to certain regulatory restrictions 
we must get approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency in order to pay dividends in excess of our bank s net earnings for the current year  plus retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus

additionally  prior to november   so long as the treasury owns shares of the series t preferred stock  we are not permitted to increase cash dividends on our common stock without the treasury s consent 
currently there are no retained earnings available to dividend up cash to the holding company

under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve and the occ  the company and the bank are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier capital 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  the bank must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions

however  we currently anticipate that the bank would be in compliance with the minimum thresholds that might be required by its regulators 
liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally the ability to generate customer deposits in our market area 
in addition  liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against approved lines of credit federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time 
these 
table of contents advances are secured by securities pledged by the bank or assignment of loans within the bank s portfolio 
with the successful completion of the common stock offering in  the secondary offering completed in  the trust preferred offering completed in september  the acquisition of dutchfork in october  the acquisition of dekalb in june and the preferred stock offering under the cpp program in november we have maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital along with retained earnings less the and net loss  sufficient to fund the operations of the bank for at least the next months 
we anticipate that the bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next months 
the loss related to goodwill impairment in was a noncash charge and has no impact on regulatory capital or tangible equity 
total shareholders equity was of total assets at december  and at december  funds sold and short term interest bearing deposits are our primary source of liquidity and averaged million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the bank maintains federal funds purchased lines  in the amount of million each with two financial institutions  although these were not utilized in the fhlb atlanta has approved a line of credit of up to of the bank assets  which would be collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities and or eligible loans 
we regularly review the liquidity position of the company and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non core sources 
we believe that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with gaap  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
please refer to note of the company s financial statements for a discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and the bank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we continually seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
