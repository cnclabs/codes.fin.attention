acquisitions 
the bhc act requires prior frb approval for  among other things  the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company 
with limited exceptions  the bhc act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries 
a bank holding company may  however  engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the frb has determined  by regulation or order  to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto  such as owning and operating a savings association  performing functions or activities that may be performed by a trust company  owning a mortgage company  or acting as an investment or financial advisor 
the frb  as a matter of policy  may require a bank holding company to be well capitalized at the time of filing an acquisition application and upon consummation of the acquisition 
the gramm leach bliley act the glb act allows bank holding companies that are in compliance with certain requirements to elect to become financial holding companies 
financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than is otherwise permitted for bank holding companies 
at this time  privatebancorp has not elected to become a financial holding company 

table of contents redemptions 
under the bhc act  bank holding companies are required to provide the frb with prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months is equal to or more of their consolidated net worth 
the frb may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  frb order  or any condition imposed by or written agreement with the frb 
this prior notice requirement does not apply to any bank holding company that meets certain well capitalized and well managed standards and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues 
under provisions of the us department of treasury s the treasury troubled asset relief program s capital purchase program cpp as more fully discussed below under emergency economic stabilization act  banks who sell equity securities to the treasury under the cpp are generally prohibited from acquiring or redeeming their common  preferred or trust preferred securities for three years  without the consent of the treasury 
pursuant to our participation in the cpp  as discussed below  our ability to repurchase equity securities is restricted until january   subject to certain exceptions  unless we redeem the treasury s preferred stock investment prior to that time or otherwise obtain treasury approval 
tie in arrangements 
under the bhc act and frb regulations  we are prohibited from engaging in tie in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit  lease  or sale of property or furnishing of services 
accordingly  we may not condition a client s purchase of one of our services on the purchase of another service  except with respect to traditional banking products 
interstate banking and branching legislation 
under the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act  bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed are allowed to acquire banks across state lines subject to certain limitations 
states may prohibit interstate acquisitions of banks that have not been in existence for at least five years 
the frb is prohibited from approving an application for acquisition if the applicant controls more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide 
in addition  interstate acquisitions may also be subject to statewide concentration limits 
furthermore  under the interstate banking act  banks are permitted  under some circumstances  to merge with one another across state lines and thereby create a main bank with branches in separate states 
approval of interstate bank mergers is subject to certain conditions  including adequate capitalization  adequate management  cra compliance and deposit concentration limits  compliance with federal and state antitrust laws and compliance with applicable state consumer protection laws 
after establishing branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction  a bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal and state law 
ownership limitations 
under the federal change in bank control act  a person may be required to obtain the prior regulatory approval of the frb before acquiring the power to directly or indirectly control the management  operations or policies of privatebancorp or before acquiring control of or more of any class of our outstanding voting stock 
under the illinois banking act  any acquisition of privatebancorp stock that results in a change in control may require prior approval of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation the idfpr 
source of strength 
under a longstanding policy of the frb  privatebancorp is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to support them 
the frb takes the position that in implementing this policy  it may require us to provide financial support when we otherwise would not consider ourselves able to do so 
dividends 
the frb has issued an updated policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
in the policy statement  the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company should inform the frb and should eliminate  defer or severely limit the payment of dividends if i the bank holding company s net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the policy statement also provides that the frb should be informed in advance prior to declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period eg  quarter for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
additionally  the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies 
in addition to the restrictions on dividends imposed by the frb  delaware law also places limitations on our ability to pay dividends 
for example  if the capital of the holding company has been diminished to an amount less than the aggregate amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock  a dividend shall not be paid until the deficiency in capital is repaired 
our ability to pay dividends may also depend on the receipt of dividends from our banking subsidiaries 
our banking subsidiaries may  however  be unable to pay such dividends 
as a result of the losses incurred by our banking subsidiaries during and  we have not 
table of contents received any dividends from them during this period 
because of our participation in the cpp  prior to january   or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  if earlier  we also may not pay regular quarterly dividends on our common stock above per share without the treasury s consent 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock and nonvoting common stock 
in the first quarter of  we reduced our quarterly dividend rate to per share from the quarterly dividend rate of per share that we paid in the fourth quarter of there can be no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock at the current levels or at all 
bank regulation our subsidiary banks  the privatebank chicago and the privatebank wisconsin  are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by various federal and state authorities 
additionally  as an affiliate of our subsidiary banks  privatebancorp is also subject  to some extent  to regulation by our subsidiary bank authorities 
the privatebank chicago is an illinois state chartered bank and as such  is subject to supervision and examination by the idfpr and  as a frb non member bank  its primary federal regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the privatebank wisconsin is a national bank and is subject to supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ and  to a lesser extent  by the fdic 
the privatebank wisconsin is a member of the fhlb of chicago and  as such  may also be subject to examination by the fhlb of chicago 
in  we consolidated the privatebank michigan  which was a michigan state chartered bank  and the privatebank st 
louis  which was a federal savings bank  with and into the privatebank chicago  and each is now regulated as part of the privatebank chicago 
in  we also withdrew our application to organize the privatewealth trust company  which would have been a federal savings bank 
regulatory approvals and enforcement 
federal and state laws require banks to seek approval by the appropriate federal or state banking agency or agencies for any merger and or consolidation by or with another depository institution  as well as for the establishment or relocation of any bank or branch office and  in some cases to engage in new activities or form subsidiaries 
federal and state statutes and regulations provide the appropriate bank regulatory agencies with great flexibility and powers to undertake enforcement actions against financial institutions  holding companies or persons regarded as institution affiliated parties 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to a cease and desist order  civil money penalties  receivership  conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance 
transactions with affiliates 
federal and state statutes place certain restrictions and limitations on transactions between banks and their affiliates  which includes holding companies 
among other provisions  these laws place restrictions upon extensions of credit by an insured financial institution to the bank holding company and any non banking affiliates  the purchase by an insured financial institution of assets from affiliates  the issuance by an insured financial institution of guarantees  acceptances or letters of credit on behalf of affiliates  and investments by an insured financial institution in stock or other securities issued by affiliates or acceptance thereof as collateral for an extension of credit 
permissible activities  investments and other restrictions 
federal and state laws provide extensive limitations on the types of activities in which our subsidiary banks may engage and the types of investments they may make 
for example  banks are subject to restrictions with respect to engaging in securities activities  real estate development activities and insurance activities and may invest only in certain types and amounts of securities and may invest only up to certain dollar amount thresholds in their premises 
monetary policy 
all of our subsidiary banks are affected by the credit policies of the frb  which regulate the national supply of bank credit 
such regulation influences overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
dividends 
federal and state laws restrict and limit the dividends our subsidiary banks may pay 
under the illinois banking act  the privatebank chicago  while continuing to operate a banking business  may not pay dividends of an amount greater than its current net profits after deducting losses and bad debts 
for the purpose of determining the amount of dividends that an illinois bank may pay  bad debts are defined as debts upon which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of six months or more unless such debts are well secured and in the process of collection 

table of contents as a national bank  the privatebank wisconsin may not declare dividends in any year in excess of its net income for the year  plus the retained net income for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to the surplus account 
furthermore  the occ may  after notice and opportunity for hearing  prohibit the payment of a dividend by a national bank if it determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition to the foregoing  the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non capital standards established under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act of fdicia  as described below 
reserve requirements 
our subsidiary banks are subject to frb regulations requiring depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts 
the first million of a bank s transaction accounts subject to adjustments by the frb are exempt from the reserve requirements 
the frb regulations generally require percent reserves on a bank s transaction accounts totaling between million and million 
for transaction accounts totaling over million  frb regulations require reserves of  plus percent of the amount over million 
cross guaranty 
under the federal deposit insurance act  an insured institution that is commonly controlled with another insured institution shall generally be liable for losses incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of such commonly controlled insured institution  or for any assistance provided by the fdic to such commonly controlled institution  which is in danger of default 
standards for safety and soundness 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  require the fdic  together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  to prescribe standards of safety and soundness  by regulations or guidelines  relating generally to operations and management  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  stock valuation and compensation 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 
in addition  the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  the agencies to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying the safety and soundness guidelines to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the agency may seek to enforce its order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have also adopted guidelines for asset quality and earning standards 
state chartered banks may also be subject to state statutes  regulations and guidelines relating to safety and soundness  in addition the federal requirements 
capital requirements and prompt corrective action 
capital requirements for our subsidiary banks generally parallel the capital requirements previously noted for bank holding companies 
there are five capital levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdicia requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that fall below minimum capital standards and prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distribution that would cause it to be undercapitalized 
institutions that are not adequately capitalized may be subject to a variety of supervisory actions  including restrictions on growth  investment activities  capital distributions and affiliate transactions  and will be required to submit a capital restoration plan which  to be accepted by the regulators  must be guaranteed in part by any company having control of the institution for example  the company or a stockholder controlling the company 
in other respects  fdicia provides for enhanced supervisory authority  including greater authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for critically undercapitalized institutions 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and its implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  the agencies may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
state chartered banks may also be subject to similar supervisory actions by their respective state banking agencies 

table of contents insurance of deposit accounts 
under fdicia  as fdic insured institutions  our subsidiary banks are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk they pose to the deposit insurance fund the dif 
the fdic has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits in order to achieve required ratios in the insurance fund and to impose special additional assessments 
to determine an institution s assessment rate  each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories using a two step process based on capital and supervisory information 
each insured institution is assigned to one of the following three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized 
each insured institution is then assigned one of three supervisory ratings a institutions with few minor weaknesses  b institutions which demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to dif or c institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to dif unless effective corrective action is taken 
insured institutions classified as strongest by the fdic are subject to the lowest insurance rate  insured institutions classified as weakest by the fdic are subject to the highest insurance assessment rate 
in october   the fdic published a restoration plan to reestablish the dif to the statutory required minimum percentage of deposits  and has amended the plan from time to time thereafter 
as part of the restoration plan  the fdic increased risk based assessment rates and may continue to do so 
effective march   the minimum and maximum total assessments for all insured institutions  after all possible adjustments  range from basis points to basis points 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the prepaid assessments will be recorded as a prepaid expense against which future quarterly assessments will be applied 
during  we expensed deposit insurance premiums in the aggregate amount of million  which included special assessments in the amount of million  and were applicable to all insured institutions 
additionally  we paid an aggregate million in deposit insurance prepayments through pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act and the american recovery and reinvestment act of each as described more fully below  the maximum deposit insurance on individual accounts was increased from  to  until december  deposit insurance may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
such terminations can only occur  if contested  following judicial review through the federal courts 
we do not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance for any of our subsidiary banks 
community reinvestment 
under the cra  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions  or limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
however  institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities 
performance is tested in three areas a lending  to evaluate the institution s lending performance  particularly to low and moderate income individuals and neighborhoods and small businesses in its assessment areas  b investment  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low income or moderate income individuals and small businesses  and c service  to evaluate the institution s delivery of products and services through its branches  and automated teller machines as well as its service to the community 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of a financial institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including applications for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities  and savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the privatebank chicago has been assigned a satisfactory rating at its most recent cra examinations 
the privatebank wisconsin has not yet been examined for cra 
anti money laundering and bank secrecy act 
under the bank secrecy act bsa  a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions  based on the size and nature of the transaction 
financial institutions are generally required to report to the united states treasury any cash transactions involving more than  in addition  financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than  and which the financial institution knows  suspects or has reason to suspect involve illegal funds  are designed to evade the requirements of the bsa or have no lawful purpose 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act  which amended the bsa  contains anti money laundering and financial transparency laws  as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the us government 
the patriot act provisions include the following standards for verifying customer identification when opening accounts  rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement  and due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain or manage certain bank accounts 
each of our banks is subject to bsa and patriot act requirements 

table of contents compliance with consumer protection laws 
our banks are subject to many state and federal statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers  such as  cra  the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act and the home mortgage disclosure act 
real estate lending concentrations 
the fdic  occ and frb have issued guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 
the guidance focuses on institutions properly identifying whether they have a commercial real estate concentration and  if so  instituting the appropriate risk management procedures and increasing capital so that it is commensurate with the risk of having such a concentration 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
in december  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency policy statement revising their previous policy on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll  which was issued in the policy statement was updated to ensure consistency with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and post supervisory guidance 
according to the revised policy statement  the alll represents one of the most significant estimates in an institution s financial statements and regulatory reports 
because of its significance  each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides that to fulfill this responsibility  each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll is in accordance with us gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
consistent with long standing supervisory guidance  the policy states that institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio 
estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management judgment and results in a range of estimated losses 
emergency economic stabilization act on october   the us congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act eesa 
eesa authorized the secretary of the us department of the treasury to purchase up to billion in troubled assets from qualifying financial institutions pursuant to the troubled asset relief program tarp 
on october   the us department of the treasury treasury  pursuant to its authority under eesa  announced the cpp 
pursuant to the cpp  qualifying public financial institutions may issue senior preferred stock to the treasury in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets and not more than of risk weighted assets or billion  whichever is less 
the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock will be included in the financial institution s tier capital 
the senior preferred stock will pay a dividend per annum until the fifth year of the investment and per annum thereafter 
in addition to the senior preferred stock  participating public financial institutions must issue a warrant to the treasury for the purchase of common stock in an amount equal to of the preferred stock investment 
treasury will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the common shares acquired through the exercise of the warrants 
financial institutions participating in the cpp must agree and comply with certain restrictions  including restrictions on redemption  dividends  repurchases and executive compensation  as discussed below 
finally  treasury may unilaterally amend any provision of the cpp to comply with changes in applicable federal statutes 
redemption 
the terms of the cpp contained restrictions on the redemption of treasury s preferred stock investment 
these restrictions on redemptions were modified on february   in connection with enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of discussed below 
dividends 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred the financial institution may not increase common dividends beyond certain levels without the treasury s consent 
in addition  the financial institution may not pay dividends on common stock unless the financial institution has paid dividends on the preferred stock 
if the financial institution does not pay dividends on the senior preferred stock for six dividend periods  the treasury will have the right to elect two members to the board of directors 
repurchases 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  the financial institution may not repurchase other equity securities or trust preferred securities without treasury s consent  except repurchases in the ordinary course related to employee benefit plans in a manner consistent with past practice  certain market making and related transactions by a broker dealer subsidiary of the financial institution  certain custodian or trustee transactions for another beneficial owner  or certain agreements pre dating participation in the cpp 

table of contents executive compensation 
participating financial institutions must modify certain senior executive compensation agreements consistent with eesa  which generally prohibits incentive compensation agreements that encourage senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks 
in addition  incentive compensation paid to senior executive officers must be recovered if such payments are subsequently determined to be based upon materially inaccurate financial results ie  a clawback provision 
participating financial institutions are prohibited from making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and are required to limit the federal tax deduction for compensation paid to senior executive officers to  for this purpose  senior executive officer means an individual who is one of the top five highly paid executives whose compensation is required to be disclosed pursuant to the exchange act 
as discussed below  these executive compensation restrictions were further expanded by the american recovery and reinvestment act of on january   privatebancorp closed the transaction with treasury in order to participate in the cpp 
privatebancorp issued preferred stock to the treasury equal to million and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
as a result of the completion of two qualified equity offerings in pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds in excess of million  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by percent from  to  shares 
pursuant to its participation in the cpp  privatebancorp is subject to the provisions therein 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of recovery act was signed into law 
included among the many provisions in the recovery act are restrictions affecting financial institutions who are participants in the tarp  which are set forth in the form of amendments to the eesa 
these amendments provide that during the period in which any obligation under the tarp remains outstanding other than obligations relating to outstanding warrants  tarp recipients are subject to appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance which were set forth in an interim final rule regarding tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance  issued by treasury and effective on june  interim final rule

a requirement that the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer provide in annual securities filings  a written certification of compliance with the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of the interim final rule  an obligation for the compensation committee of the board of directors to evaluate with the company s chief risk officer certain compensation plans to ensure that such plans do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risks or the manipulation of reported earnings  a requirement that companies adopt a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  a requirement that companies permit a separate  non binding shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives  and a provision that allows treasury to review compensation paid prior to enactment of the recovery act to senior executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees to determine whether any payments were inconsistent with the executive compensation restrictions of the eesa  as amended  tarp or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
in addition  companies who have issued preferred stock to treasury under tarp are now permitted to redeem such investments at any time  subject to consultation with banking regulators 
upon such redemption  the warrants may be immediately liquidated by treasury

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks  including those discussed below  which may affect the value of our securities 
the risks discussed below are those that we believe are the most significant risks affecting us and our business  although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
before making a decision to invest in our securities  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business we have significant credit risk related to our owner occupied commercial real estate  construction  and other commercial real estate loans 
at december   our owner occupied commercial real estate  construction and other commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and billion  respectively  or  and  respectively  of our total loan portfolio 
commencing in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter of  we experienced significant deterioration in our commercial real estate portfolio that caused a significant increase in non performing loans during this period 
we had million in total non performing assets at december   compared to million at december   largely due to the ongoing deterioration in our commercial real estate portfolio 
approximately of non accrual loans at december   were commercial real estate or construction loans 
non performing assets to total assets were at december   compared to at december  our owner occupied commercial real estate  construction  and other commercial real estate loans often involve loans with large principal amounts and the repayment of these loans generally is dependent  in large part  on the successful operation of a business occupying the property  the cost and time frame of constructing or improving a property  the availability of permanent financing  or the successful sale or leasing of the property 
these loans are often more adversely affected by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the local economy where the borrower s business is located 
the commercial real estate market continues to experience a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
in particular  market conditions in the chicago metropolitan area  in which we have a heavy concentration of loans  have declined during during the third and fourth quarters of  deterioration of our commercial real estate portfolio followed trends in the sector  including elevated commercial vacancy rates  sponsor bankruptcies and downward pressure on real estate values 
the weak state of the economy continues to put pressure on other business sectors represented in our portfolio  but not to the degree seen in commercial real estate 
many construction and commercial real estate loans do not fully amortize the balance over the loan period  but have balloon payments due at maturity 
the borrower s ability to make a balloon payment may depend on its ability to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property  which will likely be more difficult in an environment of declining property values and or increasing interest rates 
the relatively long maturities of construction loans  the borrower s inability to use funds generated by a project to service a loan until a project is completed  and the more pronounced risk to interest rate movements and the real estate market that these borrowers face while a project is being completed or seeking a buyer  further make construction loans more vulnerable to risk of repayment 
on a non owner occupied commercial property  if the cash flow from a borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  that borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
as a result of the current difficult operating environment  some borrowers may withhold key information on the property or be unwilling to provide information in a timely manner 
financial information that we have concerning borrowers with long loan maturities may no longer be accurate  which may impair our ability to properly assess the quality of the property and the loan 
further  we may realize increased losses in connection with the disposition of non performing assets 
as such  if general economic conditions continue to negatively impact these businesses  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans which were originated in the past few years and present additional credit risk 
the repayment of our loans to businesses is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower 
if the economy continues to remain weak for the foreseeable future  our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that hinder the ability of the borrower to repay its loan 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio  including owner occupied commercial real estate  totaled billion at december   or of our total loan portfolio 
while we have not experienced significant credit losses in this portfolio since  this portfolio is not as mature as certain as certain of our other portfolios and  as a result  may not yet shown signs of credit deterioration 
unlike commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business  such as accounts receivable  inventory 
table of contents and equipment 
should a commercial and industrial loan require us to foreclose on the underlying collateral  the unique nature of the collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate  thereby increasing the risk to us of not recovering the principal amount of the loan 
accordingly  our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected by defaults in this portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business 
every loan we make carries a certain risk of non payment 
this risk is affected by  among other things the credit risks posed by the particular borrower  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  and efforts to detect stress in loans at an early stage 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
the specific reserves are based on our current estimates of the value of impaired loans based on future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as the case may be 
our valuations are based on the factors we deem relevant  including in the case of commercial real estate loans updated appraisals from independent third parties or market evaluations of real estate collateral 
these judgments involve uncertainty  particularly given the current real estate environment where there is a lack of comparable real estate activity in the marketplace 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses on these loans greater than what we have provided for in the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to at december   compared to at december  charge offs were million for the year ended december   offset by recoveries of million  compared to charge offs of million for the prior year period  offset by recoveries of  over the past year  we increased our allowance as a percentage of total loans based on management s analysis of our loan portfolio s credit quality  including a significant increase in non performing loans  and other factors 
our regulators review the adequacy of our allowance and  through the examination process  have authority to compel us to increase our allowance in the current period or prior or future periods 
although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio  the allowance may not be adequate 
an increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income  and possibly regulatory capital 
if our actual loan losses exceed the amount that is anticipated  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a large portion of the loans in our portfolio was originated since the adoption of our strategic growth plan in although a high percentage of our recent credit quality deterioration relates to loans originated prior to the adoption of our strategic growth plan in  a portfolio of more mature loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio  such as ours  because loans typically do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time 
as a result  the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail when the portfolio becomes more seasoned  which may be higher than current levels 
in addition  some of these new loans are large in size 
should any of these loans default  it could materially affect our credit quality and the need to establish higher levels of loan loss reserves 
if charge offs in future periods increase and or we are required to increase our provision for loan and covered asset losses  our earnings and possibly our capital will also be adversely affected 
our recent growth and expansion may continue to strain our ability to manage our operations and stress our financial resources 
we have rapidly grown in size and scope since the inception of our strategic growth plan in this rapid growth continues to place a strain on our infrastructure  including administrative  risk management  operational and other back office functions that are essential to supporting the effective management of our business  and increased demands on our systems  controls and personnel 
this growth continues to require attention and enhancements to  and expansion of  our operating and financial systems and controls and may strain or significantly challenge them 
we may not be able to access sufficient and cost effective sources of liquidity 
we depend on access to a variety of funding sources  including deposits  to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients  including funding our loan growth 
currently  our primary sources of liquidity are our clients deposits  as well as brokered deposits  federal funds borrowings which are discretionary  uncommitted lines of credit  the frb discount window  proceeds from the sale of investment securities  proceeds from the sale of additional equity or trust preferred securities and subordinated debt 
in the fourth quarter of and throughout  we experienced a significant increase in client deposits including deposits acquired through the founders bank transaction that has allowed us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding sources 
however  
table of contents there can be no assurance that this level of client deposit growth will continue or that we will be able to maintain the lower reliance on wholesale deposits that we have recently experienced 
there is also no way to determine with any degree of certainty the reasons for the significant growth in our client deposits excluding the client deposits acquired in the founders bank transaction and hence whether these deposits are  in whole or in part  permanent or transitory 
with the expected expiration of tagp on june   as returns in the equity markets improve  if the economy improves  interest rates rise or as fdic insurance coverage is reduced  we expect some of our client deposits to move to other investment options  thus causing a reduction in our client deposits and increased reliance on wholesale funding sources 
our holding company s liquidity position is affected by the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand  payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity securities currently outstanding  instruments issued by the holding company  capital we inject into our banks subsidiaries  redemption of debt  proceeds we raise through the issuance of debt and equity securities  and dividends received from our bank subsidiaries 
our future liquidity position may be adversely affected if in the future one or a combination of the following events occurs our bank subsidiaries report net losses as the privatebank chicago has in and or our bank subsidiaries earnings are weak relative to our holding company s cashflow needs  we deem it advisable or are required by the frb to use cash at the holding company to support our bank subsidiaries through capital injections  or we have difficulty raising cash through the issuance of debt or equity securities or accessing additional sources of credit 
given the losses we recorded in  and  thus  the limitations on the ability of our bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company  we are highly dependent upon the current cash position of the holding company and cash proceeds generated by capital raises to meet our liquidity needs and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock for the foreseeable future 
we may manage our liquidity position by reducing the amount of capital we inject into our bank subsidiaries  thus causing our loan growth to slow 
this could adversely affect our results of operations and earnings if growth at our banks becomes capital constrained 
the loss of key managing directors may adversely affect our operations 
we are a relationship driven organization 
our growth and development to date have resulted in large part from the efforts of our managing directors who have primary contact with our clients and are extremely important in maintaining personalized relationships with our client base  which is a key aspect of our business strategy 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations if remaining managing directors are not successful in retaining client relationships of a departing managing director 
weak financial performance  restrictions on compensation due to our participation in the tarp capital purchase program cpp  limitations on currently available equity awards  and regulatory guidance may restrict our ability to design programs that are effective in motivating and retaining our key employees 
we may not be able to raise additional capital necessary to remain well capitalized 
if our loan portfolio continues to experience significant deterioration  our ability to continue to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements will be largely dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets 
events or circumstances in the capital markets generally or systemic risk in the banking industry specifically that are beyond our control may adversely affect our capital costs  our ability to raise capital at any given time and the dilution consequences to our stockholders of any capital raise we may undertake 
in addition  as a result of the recent underwritten public offering of our common stock and the sale of our non voting common stock to gtcr golder rauner  llc gtcr  in november  the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under our certificate of incorporation has been significantly reduced and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the available number of shares will require the approval of our stockholders 
this could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital that would qualify as tangible common equity or tier capital 
our information processing systems are integral to our operations 
we rely heavily on communications  data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our day to day banking  investment  and trust activities  many of which are provided through third parties 
any failure or disruption in these products or services  including any failure or interruption resulting from a breach in security  could result in disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  risk management  or other systems 
we have policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure  interruption  or security breach of our systems 
however  there can be no assurance that our policies  procedures and security efforts will be effective  or that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that the impact will not be substantial  including damage to our reputation  a loss of customer business  additional regulatory scrutiny  or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we are required to take any charges related to asset impairments  including deferred tax valuation allowances and goodwill impairments  our results of operations and capital position may be adversely affected 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets and million of net deferred tax assets that arise because of differences in accounting treatment for financial and tax reporting purposes 
in assessing whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was needed  we considered a number of factors relevant to our judgment 
the evidence associated with the continuing difficult and challenging economic environment in which we are operating and our cumulative pre tax loss for financial statement purposes  measured on a trailing three year period were negative factors in our analysis 
included among the positive factors was our taxable income position for  the expectation of reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  and our expectations for generating taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  over a relatively short time period 
these expectations for future taxable income were based in large part on the prospects for generating pre tax book income 
we relied on several factors in our judgment as to the quality and reliability of future pre tax book income 
these included the growth trends in pre tax  pre provision earnings during and the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio 
we also believe our strong tangible capital position provides a level of confidence regarding our ability to absorb future credit losses without impairing longer term prospects for generating future pre tax book income and taxable income in amounts that more likely than not would be sufficient to support the realization of deferred tax assets 
based on our analysis of all the factors considered  we reached the conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be realized in future tax periods 
as described above  our conclusion is dependent on a number of factors 
to the extent these or certain other assumptions change materially  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against all or part of the net deferred tax asset  which would adversely affect our results of operations and capital levels and ratios 
in addition  even if we continue to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed for us gaap  we could be required to disallow all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset for bank regulatory purposes 
at december   we had a disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory purposes of million 
the assessment of whether the net deferred tax asset is disallowed  in whole or in part  for regulatory purposes is based on regulatory guidelines  which in some cases  are more restrictive than those of us gaap 
although a disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory purposes does not impact our results of operations  it does reduce our regulatory capital ratios 
goodwill is an intangible asset and is subject to periodic impairment analysis 
certain facts or circumstances may indicate impairment that may lead us to recording an expense to write down this asset 
we had million in goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
our goodwill was created as a result of several acquisitions we completed in prior years 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our impairment determination would rely on assumptions critical to the process including discount rates  asset and liability growth rates  and other income and expense estimates 
if the impairment analysis of a reporting unit leads us to a conclusion that the book value exceeds its fair value  we would incur an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill

risks related to our operating environment continued tightening of the credit markets and instability in the financial markets could adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide  funding to borrowers including other financial institutions 
this has resulted in less available credit  a lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity 
a sustained period of instability in the financial markets  tight credit markets and a continued or upward trend in bank failures would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the risks we face 
in this respect  and although the us treasury and the fdic  among other agencies  have implemented programs to stabilize the us economy  the long term effectiveness of these measures remains uncertain 
weak economic conditions could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents various segments of the us economy have been in a prolonged and deep slowdown recently  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in each of our markets has declined and remains stressed and volatile 
a sustained period of high unemployment or further deterioration in the national or local business or economic conditions could result in  among other things  a further deterioration of credit quality or a reduced demand for credit  including a resultant effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses 
these factors could result in higher delinquencies and additional charge offs in future periods  especially given our exposure to commercial real estate lending  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
continued  sustained weakness in business and economic conditions generally  or in our markets specifically  could have  and in some cases have had  one or more of the following adverse impacts on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us  a decrease in the value of the collateral underlying loans  requiring paydowns by our borrowers to remain in loan to value compliance or  alternatively  resulting in a default  a decrease in the value of any loans that we may hold for sale  longer holding periods required to liquidate property acquired upon default or loans held for sale  thereby increasing carrying costs and potentially impacting market values  and an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults in future periods could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  provision for loan and covered asset losses  and valuation adjustments on any loans held for sale  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income 
fluctuations in interest rates may significantly affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on earning assets  usually loans and investment securities  and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
over the long term  we expect our net interest margin to benefit during a rising rate environment 
changes in the slope of the treasury yield curve could also impact our net interest margin 
we are unable to predict fluctuations in interest rates  which are affected by factors including monetary policy of the frb  inflation or deflation  recession  unemployment rates  money supply  domestic and foreign events  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
the timing of any frb action to curtail or eliminate various stimulus related programs  as a result of inflation concerns or otherwise  could have an impact on interest rates in general and our net interest margin in particular 
our investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or spreads caused by governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  issuer or insurer credit deterioration and other factors beyond our control 
a rise in interest rates or spread widening would reduce the net unrealized gains currently reflected in our investment portfolio  offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested 
risks related to the financial services industry we are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws  regulations  and regulatory practices  including the actions being taken by the us government in response to the recent financial crises 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing consumer credit  and anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws  but also capital adequacy  asset quality and risk  management ability and performance  earnings  liquidity  and various other factors 
as part of this regulatory structure  we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine  among other things  that our operations are unsafe or unsound  fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies 
this supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct  growth and profitability of our operations 
any failure on our part to comply with current laws  regulations  other regulatory requirements or safe and sound banking practices or concerns about our financial condition  or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us  could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation 

table of contents changes in laws  regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting the financial services industry  and the effects of such changes  are difficult to predict and may have unintended consequences 
new regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
these changes also can adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program subjects us to certain restrictions 
on january   we issued approximately million of our senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the us treasury under the cpp 
based on our participation in the cpp  we agreed to comply with its terms and conditions  which subjects us to certain restrictions  oversight  costs and compliance and reputational risks 
for example  we may not  without the consent of the us treasury  increase our dividend  currently per share per quarter  above a rate of per quarter or  subject to certain exceptions  engage in repurchases of our common stock or trust preferred securities until january  or  if earlier  the date on which all preferred stock issued to the us treasury has been redeemed or transferred by the us treasury 
our participation in the cpp also subjects us to additional executive compensation and other restrictions  which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior executive officers  particularly in light of the fact that some of the financial institutions with which we compete are not subject to the restrictions imposed by the cpp 
furthermore  under the terms of the securities purchase agreement we entered into with the us treasury  the us treasury will be able to unilaterally amend the agreement to make it consistent with any subsequent statutory provisions implemented by congress 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the program or the securities purchase agreement  including any restrictions upon our use of the cpp proceeds  we could become subject to a regulatory enforcement action or legal proceedings brought by the us government  which  in turn  would present significant reputational risks for us that could affect our ability to retain or attract new clients or investors if and when we determine to raise additional capital or both 
the creditworthiness of us and other financial institutions could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our clients  specifically products and services relating to foreign exchange  derivatives and letters of credit 
our ability to provide certain products and service could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other banks 
banks are interrelated as a result of lending  clearing  correspondent  counterparty and other relationships 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more banks  or the banking industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of the transactions engaged in by us in the ordinary course of business  particularly in our capital markets group  expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or customer 
in such instances  the collateral we hold may be insufficient to mitigate our losses  as we may be unable to realize or liquidate at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure 
such losses could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital markets group offers an extensive range of over the counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products  including but not limited to interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  interest rate options which include caps  floors and collars  foreign exchange forwards and options  as well as cash products such as foreign exchange spot transactions 
although we do not engage in any proprietary trading and we structure these client generated trading activities to mitigate our exposure to market risk  we remain exposed to various risks  the most significant of which include credit risk of our counterparties  operational risk and settlement risk  which may be most significant in foreign exchange transactions where timing differences between settlement centers can result in us paying our client and or counterparty before actually receiving the funds 
the exposure of our counterparties requires active monitoring of potential calls as well as liquidity management to ensure timely and cost efficient posting of collateral 
operational risk includes errors in execution of internal bank procedures and controls  which could expose us to financial and or reputation loss 
a lapse or breakdown of these procedures or controls could significantly increase our exposure to counterparty credit risk and operational risk  which could result in a material loss to us 
demand for the products or services of our capital markets group could be negatively impacted by interest rate changes or other factors and a decrease in sales volumes from this group could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry 
we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors 
our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment 
we compete for loans  deposits  wealth management and other financial services in our geographic markets with other commercial banks  thrifts  credit unions and brokerage firms operating in the markets we serve 
many of our competitors offer products and services which we do not  and many have substantially greater resources and economies of scale  name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 

table of contents to be competitive  we will need to continue to invest in technology  infrastructure and human resources 
this investment is directed at enhancing our risk management function and generating new products and services  and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of our clients 
falling behind our competition in any of these areas  could adversely affect our business 
we are being required to pay and may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings 
recent bank failures and market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
as a result  we are being required to pay significantly higher premiums or additional special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings 
it is possible that the fdic may require higher premiums and impose additional special assessments in the future on the industry and the banks generally or as a result of regulatory examination findings or conclusions

this weakness has resulted in continued stress in our loan portfolio  and required us to recognize a provision for loan and covered asset losses of million and to charge off million in loans during despite the difficult operating and credit environment we experienced strong growth in both loans and deposits as well as in our operating profit 
continued growth in client relationship resulted in increased fee revenue and additional opportunities to cross sell our enhanced products and services  including in our capital markets and treasury management areas 
we believe continued growth in client relationships should lead to higher net revenue and deposits and continued improvement in our net interest margin 
throughout 
table of contents the year we strengthened our credit risk management process  focusing on enhanced asset quality management  and in the fourth quarter we redeployed a number of our bankers to leverage their specific industry expertise to deal with the challenges in our credit portfolio 
key factors affecting our operating results for include the following net charge offs totaled million compared to million in the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december   the loan loss allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was at december  compared to at december  nonperforming loans to total loans were at december   compared to at december  other real estate owned totaled million at year end compared to million at the end of  comprised of properties 
net interest income was million compared to million for  an increase of 
non interest income increased  to million  compared to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in fee revenue from the expansion of our products and services offered through the treasury management and capital markets groups as well as a significant increase in mortgage banking income 
our loan portfolio increased  or billion  resulting in a significant increase in interest income and growth to billion in assets 
client deposits grew to billion  an increase of  reducing our reliance on more expensive wholesale funding sources  total brokered deposits decreased from year end fee income grew to million as a result of the expansion of our treasury management  capital markets  and letter of credit services 
net revenue grew over to million  operating profit increased to million  up from million in net interest margin increased to for compared to in primarily due to growth in client deposits and a basis point decrease in the cost of funds  which was only partially offset by a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year over year 
our efficiency ratio improved to for  compared to for we raised a total of approximately million  after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses  in new equity capital during  resulting in a ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of at december  in the third quarter of  the privatebank chicago  acquired approximately million in assets  including million in investments and million in loans  and assumed million in liabilities including million in non brokered deposits and million in federal home loan bank fhlb advances of the former founders bank founders from the fdic in an fdic assisted transaction 
the privatebank chicago and the fdic entered into a loss sharing agreement regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at closing 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic generally will assume of the first million of credit losses and of the credit losses in excess of million 
we believe the transaction provides us a strong platform upon which to build our new community banking line of business  including additional opportunities to cross sell our products and services and generate new core funding

results of operations the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan and covered asset losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on  interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on  interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of 
table of contents interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan and covered asset losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from the privatewealth group  capital market product income  treasury management fees  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains losses and net gains losses on interest rate swaps  if any  are also included in non interest income 
net income our net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher non interest expenses and the preferred stock dividend paid at the holding company  continued high levels of provision for loan and covered asset losses of million  offset by growth in net interest income and fee revenue from new capital markets and treasury management product offerings and banking and other services income 
during the year  we charged off million in non performing loans 
net interest income net interest income is the primary source of our revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  repricing frequencies  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
our accounting and reporting policies conform to us gaap and general practice within the financial services industry 
for purposes of this discussion  net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component  such as for example  net interest margin  have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt securities to those on taxable interest earning assets 
although we believe that these non us gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance  these non us gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to us gaap 
the reconciliation of such adjustment is presented in the following table 
table effect of tax equivalent adjustment amounts in thousands years ended december  change net interest income us gaap tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income table provides average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the three years ended december  the table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for and  including the tax equivalent yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents table below details increases in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and analyzes the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume and rate changes

the volume of assets and liabilities and the corresponding rates earned and paid affect net interest income 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to substantial growth in interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets for were billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year primarily due to a basis point decrease in the cost of funds  which was only partially offset by a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year over year 
our balance sheet is structured such that our interest bearing liabilities reprice more slowly than our interest earning assets as interest rates change 
throughout  the prime rate of interest did not fall as it did during and short term libor rates fell less and more slowly than during therefore  during we were able to reprice our interest bearing liabilities such that the level of reductions outpaced those on our interest earning assets 
additionally  during our continued growth of client deposits allowed us to reposition our funding mix away from more costly wholesale funding  further benefiting our net interest margin 
non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed to fund interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by basis points for and basis points for net interest margin increased during initially due to rates falling on our interest bearing liabilities more quickly than the yields on our interest earning assets 
during the second half of the year  net interest margin was further benefited by the inclusion of favorably priced interest earning assets  acquired as a result of the founders transaction 
however  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by the increase in non performing assets during the year  which grew to million at december  from million at december  compared to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to substantial growth in interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets for were billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year primarily due to a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets year over year  which was only partially offset by a basis point reduction in the cost of funds over the same period 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by basis points for and basis points for net interest margin declined throughout due to continued decreases in the prime and libor rates of interest as our interest earning assets re priced more quickly than our interest bearing deposits 
our net interest margin was further negatively impacted by the increase in non performing assets during the year  which grew to million at december  from million at december  we continue to use multiple interest rate scenarios to rigorously assess the direction and magnitude of changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest income

covered assets represent assets acquired from the fdic subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the consolidated statements of condition 
as shown in tables and  tax equivalent net interest income in increased million compared to this was the result of both an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest earning assets increased tax equivalent interest income by million  while a decline in the average rate earned on interest earning assets reduced interest income by million 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities increased interest expense by million  but the shift to lower costing money market accounts and the overall decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by million 
provision for loan and covered asset losses the provision for loan and covered asset losses consists of two components  provision for loan losses associated with our originated loan portfolio  and provision for covered asset losses associated with assets acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition of founders that are covered by a loss share agreement 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is predominantly a function of our reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to 
table of contents bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
our methodology focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect potential credit losses the provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to loan growth of during the year  and net charge offs of million in compared to million in and million in net charge offs in were largely driven by the continued deterioration in commercial real estate market conditions in all of our key lending markets we operate in 
for further analysis and information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based  see the credit quality management and allowance for loan losses section 
provision for covered asset losses during fourth quarter  a million allowance for covered asset losses was established related to the loans purchased under the founders loss share agreement and reflected a decline in expected cashflows since the date of acquisition of such loans 
the provision for covered asset losses totaled  in  representing the non reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement 
non interest income non interest income is derived from a number of sources related to our banking  capital markets  treasury management and wealth management businesses

banking and other services income for the year ended december  includes million net loss on sale of loans 
compared to during we continued to seek ways to increase and diversify the sources of our non interest income 
our total non interest income increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in non interest income during was due to the contribution of our expanded products and services which were expanded in the past year offered through the treasury management group  new product offerings contributing to increased banking and other services income  increased revenue from capital markets products  and a significant increase in mortgage banking income 

table of contents capital markets income was million for the year ended december   a increase from million for the year ended december  the income includes an  favorable movement in the credit valuation adjustment cva 
the cva represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client based trades and the related matched trades with interbank dealer counterparties 
capital markets revenue is sensitive to the pace of loan growth  a steepened libor curve and our clients interest rate expectations 
also  low short term interest rates have accelerated the yield protection trend of embedding floors in loans  resulting in fewer derivatives cross sell opportunities 
we continue to enhance our treasury management capabilities and now provide all aspects of receivables and payables services in addition to online banking and reporting 
we offer remote capture  liquidity management  and lockbox services to meet our clients needs and drive non interest and interest bearing deposits to the banks 
treasury management income was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to growth in delivery of services to new and existing clients and increased penetration in our clients transaction based activities 
mortgage banking income was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  mortgage banking income increased over the prior period due to the low interest rate environment  which continues to stimulate market demand for refinancing and a higher volume of loans sold 
the privatewealth group s fee revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  the privatewealth group s assets under management which includes investment management  trust and custodial accounts were billion at december   an increase from billion at december  the decrease in revenue year over year is due to lower asset values during the first half of and a higher allocation of assets to non fee producing cash equivalents and an increase in lower fee producing client relationships during compared to banking and other services income increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase from the prior year period is primarily due to fees related to increased product offerings such as syndication fees  unused commitment fees and an increase in letters of credit fees 
non interest income in includes net investment securities gains of million compared to net gains of  in the prior year period 
the increase in securities gains was primarily due to sales of us treasury securities made during the second quarter of compared to non interest income increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  of the million increase in non interest income during  approximately was due to the robust growth in fee income from our treasury management and capital markets groups 
during  we enhanced or introduced a variety of new products and services including capital markets products  lockbox  control disbursement  virtual vault  interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange services 
capital markets income was million for the year ended december  treasury management income was million for the year ended december   an increase from  for the year ended december  the privatewealth group fee revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  the year over year increase in the privatewealth group fee revenue was due to earnings on higher asset values prior to the significant decline in the debt and equity markets during fourth quarter and continued implementation of higher fees structures for certain client relationships 
the privatewealth group assets under management were billion at december   a slight decrease from billion at december   with new business nearly offset by cash transfers to the banks cdars program and lower market values due to declining debt and equity markets 
banking and other services income increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in letters of credit fees 
non interest income in includes net investment securities gains of  compared to net gains of  in the prior year period

compared to our revenue growth continues to outpace growth in our expenses and we continue to actively run our business to maintain tight cost control and expense management while still making the necessary investments needed to operate our business 
our efficiency ratio non interest expense as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income plus total non interest income was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this ratio indicates that during we spent to generate each dollar of revenue  compared to in non interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
the increase represents continued investment in our strategic development throughout the year and a combined increase in net occupancy expense  technology costs  loan and collection expenses  and significantly higher insurance costs 
the increase over the prior year is also due to the ongoing and defined transaction integration costs attributable to the founders transaction 
compensation expense increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the increase in full time equivalent fte employees from ftes at year end to  ftes at december  the increase in ftes is primarily associated with the addition of employees from the former founders bank 
the increase was partially offset by a million net reduction in our annual cash incentive plans cip compared to full year our principal cip is primarily based on the company s earning performance and due to its net loss in  the plan did not provide for incentive compensation payment to employees other than to associate managing directors  certain officers and staff 
cip accruals for management those above an associate managing director title recorded in the first half of were reversed in the third quarter  with no additional accruals recorded in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the increase in occupancy expense during to million  compared to million in  reflects the investments we have made in growing our office space to accommodate our larger downtown chicago team and ten additional offices acquired as a result of the founders transaction 
technology and related costs  which include fees paid for information technology services and support  increased to million in  compared to million for the year ended december  technology and related costs increased during due to increased operational costs and investment in technology to support our expanded products and services as a result of our growth and the founders integration costs 
professional fees  which include fees paid for legal  accounting  consulting  and information systems consulting services  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase is primarily due to costs associated with the execution of the founders transaction and subsequent integration activities 
insurance expense increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in insurance expense is primarily due to an increase in fdic insurance premiums caused by increased rates  special assessments totaling million in the second quarter  and a increase in deposit balances during the magnitude of this expense is determined by deposit levels and the premiums imposed by the fdic  which remain subject to change and are dependent in part on the banks safety and soundness rating by the fdic 
loan and collection expense increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase is due to costs associated with nonperforming loan review  monitoring and workout activity 
other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for other expense includes various categories such as bank charges  costs associated with the cdars product offering  education related costs  subscriptions  and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the million increase is largely attributable to higher cdars fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category  increased fees paid to third party service providers used on a recurring basis  and restructuring charges

due to the increase of ftes  or from year end of ftes  compensation expense increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in ftes is directly associated with the implementation of our strategic growth plan and our investment in attracting and retaining the highest quality human capital as a cornerstone of that plan 
this resulted in greater base salary costs and attendant payroll taxes and medical program costs  sign on and annual bonuses and  most significantly  share based compensation expense  a majority of which were incurred in connection with the transformational equity awards issued in fourth quarter and throughout the increase in occupancy expense during to million  compared to million in  is due to the expansion and improvement of several of our existing offices and leasing office space for new business development offices opened in during the second quarter  we signed a definitive lease agreement for office space at south lasalle street in chicago and moved our headquarters there in the first quarter of technology and related costs increased to million in  compared to million for the year ended december  technology and related costs increased during due to investment in technology company wide and support for facility relocations and upgrading 
marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in marketing expense reflects an increase in marketing initiatives for client development  website upgrade  charitable contributions  and overall growth in our business development activities 
professional fees increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase is primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees to support various strategic initiatives including the rapid expansion of products and service offerings  infrastructure enhancements  hiring of key personnel and increased fees paid for external and internal audit services

insurance expense increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in insurance expense is primarily due to an increase in fdic insurance premiums caused by increased rates and a substantial increase in deposit balances during other expenses and loan and collection expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for other expense includes various categories such as bank charges  costs associated with the cdars product offering  education related costs  subscriptions  credit related costs and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the million increase is largely attributable to higher cdars fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category  greater credit related costs associated with increased nonperforming loan activity and increased subscriptions and education costs to service additional ftes 
our efficiency ratio  which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non interest expense  for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio during reflected the impact of the higher level of non interest expenses associated with continued implementation of our plan throughout  with revenue gains lagging in time as expected 
on a tax equivalent basis  this ratio indicates that during we spent to generate each dollar of revenue  compared to in income taxes our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are detailed in table table income tax provision analysis dollars in thousands years ended december  loss income before income tax provision income tax benefit provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of principally due to state income taxes  the effects of tax exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance and non deductible compensation and business expenses 
the effective tax benefit rate was marginally greater in than in primarily because of the higher proportion of tax exempt income  relative to the loss before income taxes 
this was mitigated somewhat in by a proportionally higher amount of non deductible compensation 
the relatively low effective income tax rate for is primarily the result of the high proportion of tax exempt income relative to income before income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
as a result of the pre tax losses incurred during and  we are in a cumulative pre tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three year period ended december  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  we have concluded that based on the weight given to other positive evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in making this determination  we have considered the positive evidence associated with taxable income generated in and reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods 
most significantly  however  we have relied on our ability to generate future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  over a relatively short time period 
deferred tax assets at december  represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets  although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance 
future federal taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  of approximately million is necessary in order to fully absorb the federal deferred tax assets at december  
table of contents the company recorded a pre tax loss for financial statement purposes in various book tax differences result in the company being in a positive taxable income position for in assessing our prospects for generating future pre tax book income  we considered a number of factors  including a our success in achieving strong and growing operating income pre tax  pre provision results during  b the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio  and c our significant excess tangible capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks 
these factors support our expectation of higher pre tax earnings in future periods 
we believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels exclusive of reversing temporary differences that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets over a short time period 
operating segments results we have three primary business segments banking which includes our lines of business  illinois commercial and specialty banking  national commercial banking  commercial real estate  private banking and community banking  the privatewealth group  and holding company activities 
the privatebank mortgage company results are included in the banking segment

net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase from a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income for the banking segment resulted primarily from an increase in both interest income and non interest income  offset by a increase in non interest expense 
the net loss for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of from net income of million for the year ended december  net interest income for the banking segment for the year ended december  increased to million from million in and from million in total loans for the banking segment increased by to billion at december  compared to billion at december  commercial loans  including commercial and industrial and owner occupied commercial real estate loans  continue to be the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio and increased to billion  or of our total loans  from billion  or of total loans at december  commercial real estate loans were of our total loans at december   compared to of total loans at december  total deposits increased by to billion at december  from billion at december  growth in non interest bearing demand deposits  money market deposits and interest bearing deposits accounted for the majority of the deposit growth

the privatewealth group s assets under management grew to billion at december  as compared to billion at december   despite a volatile year for both the equity and fixed income markets 
the growth was attributable to a combination of new business and market appreciation 
the privatewealth group s fee revenue decreased to million  or  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decline in fee revenue was primarily due to lower asset values during the first half of and higher levels of assets held in non fee producing cash equivalents and lower fee producing client relationships during the year 
net income for the privatewealth group increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  and up from million for the same period in the increase in net income is attributable to lower operating costs with an emphasis on expense control and a higher net interest credit attributable to cash balances held as deposits in the banks 
for a number of our wealth management relationships  we utilize third party investment managers  including lodestar  in which the privatebank chicago has a ownership position 
fees paid to third party investment managers decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in the decrease is generally attributable to a decline in total assets managed by third party investment managers  with an increase in assets managed in mutual funds and exchange traded funds  as well as an increase in the portion of funds that are managed by fixed income managers rather than equity managers 
fees paid to lodestar  which are eliminated in consolidation  totaled approximately  in  compared to  in and  in of our third party investment managers  none individually managed more than of total wealth management assets under management as of december  holding company activities the holding company activities segment consists of parent company only matters 
the holding company s most significant assets are its net investments in its two banking subsidiaries and its mortgage banking subsidiary 
holding company activities are reflected 
table of contents primarily by interest expense on borrowings  operating expenses and common and preferred dividends 
recurring holding company operating expenses consist primarily of compensation amortization of share based compensation and professional fees 
the holding company segment reported a net loss available to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in and a net loss of for the increase in the net loss year over year is primarily due to the payment of preferred stock dividends and an increase in non interest expense 
additional information about our operating segments are also discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
financial condition investment securities portfolio management we manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines  to meet pledging and liquidity requirements  and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to attempt to protect net interest income against the impact of changes in interest rates 
we adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors  including expected liquidity needs  the current and forecasted interest rate environment  our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate  and the related value of various segments of the securities markets 
investments are comprised of debt securities and non marketable equity investments 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of us treasury securities  municipal bonds  mortgage backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations 
all debt securities are classified as available for sale and may be sold as part of our asset liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on the securities available for sale represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported  on an after tax basis  as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change  thereby affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio

the clients usually maintain deposit relationships with us and may utilize  personally or through entities they control  other company banking services  such as treasury management  capital markets or privatewealth services 
we seek to reduce our credit risk through disciplined credit underwriting combined with established loan portfolio sub limits by loan type  collateral and industry to promote loan portfolio diversification and active credit administration 
given recent and current market conditions  we have determined to limit our growth in commercial real estate and construction loans 
we do not engage in sub prime residential lending and do not securitize our loans for sale

growth in commercial loans of million  or  was the most significant driver of overall loan growth during this growth reflects the inclusion of new middle market client loans originated by lenders having long term  established relationships with the clients 
the million  or  growth in commercial real estate loans was spread across multiple property types with the exception of land loans  which decreased by million due to the migration of some of these loans to the construction category and the strategic de emphasis on this type of lending

total gross loans increased billion  or  during compared to while all loan categories displayed strong growth since december   growth in commercial loans of billion  or  was the most significant driver of overall loan growth  reflecting the new middle market client loans booked by lenders hired under our plan 
the middle market lending focus of these lenders complemented the existing lenders book of business  with the new lending relationships contributing to greater loan portfolio diversification 
the million  or  growth of commercial real estate loans was spread across all major property types with a greater geographic dispersion and reflects a larger average loan size for this category of credit 
the million  or  growth of construction loans was tempered by the decrease in residential development loans  offsetting solid growth of non residential construction loans 
during  consumer loans  which include residential real estate  home equity and personal loans  grew by million or 
commercial loans as of december   commercial loans grew by million  or  to billion compared to billion at december  an independent review and approval of potential new lending relationships by our credit administration  and also by our loan committee for larger dollar size transactions  provides oversight for selective growth 
we have a specific focus on certain specialized industries  including healthcare  construction and engineering  and security alarm services 
commercial loans outstanding at december  generated by these teams of specialist lenders totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during the year we also hired a small team of asset based lenders whose loans totaled million at december  our commercial loans also include loans secured by non residential owner occupied commercial real estate  since the cash flow of the owner s business is the primary source of loan repayment  these loans total million at december  and million at december  our commercial loan portfolio is comprised of lines of credit to businesses for working capital needs  term loans for equipment and expansion  letters of credit and owner occupied commercial real estate loans 
commercial loans can contain risk factors unique to the business of each borrower 
in order to mitigate these risks  we seek to gain an understanding of the business of each borrower  place appropriate value on collateral taken and structure the loan properly to make sure that collateral values are maintained through the life of the loan 
appropriate documentation of commercial loans is also important to protect our interests 
our lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line  and priced by a floating rate formula 
in general  lines of credit are reviewed annually and are supported by accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
depending on the risk profile of the borrower  we may require periodic aging of receivables  and inventory and equipment listings to 
table of contents verify the quality of the borrowing base prior to advancing funds 
our term loans are also typically secured by the assets of our clients businesses 
term loans typically have maturities between one to five years  with either floating or fixed rates of interest 
commercial borrowers are required to provide updated financial statements quarterly and personal financial statements at least annually 
letters of credit are an important product to many of our clients 
we issue standby or performance letters of credit  and can service the international needs of our clients through correspondent banks 
we use the same underwriting standards for letters of credit as we do for funded loans 
our commercial lending underwriting process includes an evaluation of the borrower s financial statements and projections with an emphasis on operating results  cash flow  liquidity and balance sheet proportions as well as the collateral to determine the level of creditworthiness of the borrower 
generally  these loans are secured by a first priority security interest in all the assets of the borrower and also include the support of a personal guarantee of one or more of the principals of the borrower 
while our loan policies have guidelines for advances on different types of collateral  we establish eligible asset values on a case by case basis for each borrower 
as we continue to grow our middle market commercial lending business  we will offer more traditional middle market commercial loan products that will require higher monitoring of our borrower s collateralized assets and may include lending that is nonrecourse 
commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans at december  totaled billion  up million  or  from billion at december  the growth included the migration of loans previously reported in the construction category as these loans progressed past the construction phase and as certificates of occupancy were issued 
due to the middle market orientation of these new larger borrowers contrasted to the smaller entrepreneurial orientation of our existing private client borrowers  the average loan size has increased and borrower type has become more diversified 
although the geographic location of the commercial real estate collateral is significantly concentrated in the chicago metropolitan area  originations from our business development offices in denver and minneapolis are contributing to an increased geographic diversification of the underlying collateral 
as a percentage of total loans  commercial real estate loans have decreased from at december  to at december  this is reflective of our strategy over the past several years to decrease the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio and further diversify by adding a higher mix of commercial loans 
our commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including family non owner occupied housing units located primarily in the banks target market areas  other non owner occupied multi family real estate  office buildings  warehouses  retail space  mixed use buildings  and vacant land  the bulk of which is held for long term investment or development 
commercial real estate loan concentrations by collateral type are reviewed against established sub limits as part of our credit risk management and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance 
refer to table for more detail on our commercial real estate and construction loans by collateral type 
risks inherent in real estate lending are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral  the underlying cash flows and documentation 
it is important to accurately assess property values through careful review of appraisals 
we mitigate these risks through review and understanding of the appraised value of the property  the ability of the cash flow generated from the collateral property to service debt  the significance of any outside income of the borrower or income from other properties owned by the borrowers  adhering to our loan documentation policies and the strength of guarantors  as applicable 
our real estate appraisal policy addresses selection of appraisers  appraisal standards  environmental issues and specific requirements for different types of properties  and has been approved by the banks credit policy committee 
construction loans construction loans at december  totaled million  down million or from million at december  residential construction loans decreased by million as a result of lower residential construction volume and our strategic decision in early to wind down our existing residential development portfolio and de emphasize this type of lending 
non residential construction loans decreased by million due to the cyclical construction downturn and the lifecycle migration of loans secured by construction projects to commercial real estate loans 
over the past two years our construction portfolio has become more diversified by type of construction project 
more granular construction loan collateral coding put in place during shows a well diversified portfolio at december  due to increased project complexity and its effect on completion risk associated with construction loans  in we hired dedicated construction lending specialists to monitor construction loan draws 
as with commercial real estate loans  we review our construction loan concentrations as part of our risk management program and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance 
our construction loan portfolio consists of single family residential properties  multi family properties  and commercial projects  and includes both investment properties and properties that will be owner occupied 
as construction lending has greater inherent risk  we 
table of contents closely monitor the status of each construction loan throughout its term 
typically  we require full investment of the borrower s equity in construction projects prior to injecting our funds 
generally  we do not allow borrowers to recoup their equity from the sale proceeds of finished product if applicable until we have recovered our funds on the overall project 
due to the inherent risks and the monitoring requirements  our construction loans are often the highest yielding loans in our portfolio 
we seek to manage these risks by  among other things  ensuring that the collateral value of the property throughout the construction process does not fall below acceptable levels  ensuring that funds disbursed are within parameters set by the original construction budget  and properly documenting each construction draw 
although we have experienced an increase in the number of construction loans that are non performing  due to our more stringent standards for underwriting and monitoring construction loans and the credit profile of our borrowers  we are comfortable with the risk associated with this portfolio

personal loans at december   personal loans totaled million  up million from million at december  our personal loan portfolio consists largely of loans for investment asset acquisition and general liquidity purposes  including lines of credit 
due to our private client focus  which includes lending to entrepreneurs  some of these loans can be sizeable 
we have minimal automobile loans and no credit card loans 
loan concentrations loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   commercial real estate loans and construction loans comprised and of our total loan portfolio  respectively 
while there still is a geographic concentration of loans made to clients residing in the chicago metropolitan area  these concentrations are lessening due to our recent expanded national presence 
with respect to our construction loan portfolio  the volume of residential construction loans has decreased over the past two years  reflecting the downturn in residential construction and our strategic decision to run off our residential development portfolio 
the composition of our construction loan portfolio is now predominantly loans related to commercial construction projects 
the non residential construction loans are diversified by project type and geographic location 
our commercial loan portfolio of billion at december  is well diversified with no evident industry concentrations in excess of of total loans

table of contents credit quality management and allowance for loan losses loan quality is monitored by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
we have established policies  procedures  and practices designed to mitigate credit risk 
chief among these is the management loan committee process which presents selected credits based on amount and risk before a group of seasoned credit professionals which vet the loan at approval and then at appropriate intervals 
also in place to monitor and manage loan quality are standard lending and credit policies  underwriting criteria  and collateral monitoring 
we monitor and implement our formal credit policies and procedures and regularly evaluate trends  collectability  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio 
our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and modified in order to manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
our credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system 
this system allows for common reference across loan types and facilitates the identification of emerging problems in loan transactions 
our internal credit review function performs regular reviews of the lending groups to assess the accuracy of loan ratings and the adherence to credit policies 
exam results are communicated to senior lending and risk management executives as well as specified board of director committees 
lending officers have the primary responsibility for monitoring their client relationships and effecting timely changes to loan ratings as events warrant 
in addition  our senior lenders actively review those loans that call for more extensive monitoring and may warrant some degree of remediation 
these loans are reviewed at least quarterly by a committee of senior lending and risk management officers  including the chief executive officer and chief risk officer  which assesses and directs actions plans to minimize the risk of these loans 
more troubled loans are reviewed on a monthly basis for heightened oversight with such reviews including the participation of the chief executive and chief risk officers 
we also maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
we evaluate the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses based on the combined total of the general and specific reserve components 
our application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of million at december  providing coverage of total loans compared with million providing coverage of total loans at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  reflects management s judgment concerning the credit risk inherent in the portfolio 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of december  in addition to the allowance for loan losses  we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities 
the reserve is included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and totaled million at december  compared to  at december  the reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses 
net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

the key factors in determining the level of provision is the composition of our loan portfolio  loan growth  risk rating distribution within each major loan category  historical loss experience and internal and external factors 
weakness in the general economy and  in particular  higher vacancy rates in commercial real estate  sponsor bankruptcies  declining real estate values  limited sales activity and little financing activity severely impacted our portfolio 
the loan loss allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was at december  compared to at december  during  net charge offs totaled million as compared to million in the prior year period

the allocated reserve for our consumer loans residential real estate  home equity  and personal increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  and is attributable to deterioration in credit performance experienced during and general concerns surrounding the consumer sector 
under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components general allocated component of the allowance the general allocated component of the allowance increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the magnitude of the dollar increase in the general allocated portion of the allowance reflects loan rating downgrades throughout the year and higher loan volumes 
our loan loss allowance model is driven primarily by risk rating distribution and historical loss experience within each major loan category  and internal and external factors 
the loan loss factors used in our analysis reflect the significant losses realized during  providing us current experience upon which to base our model s results 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is also a judgment and reflects our current view of market conditions and portfolio performance 
during  we began using amplification factors reflecting these judgments to adjust the loss factors in our model which allows us to fully allocate the general reserves across the loan categories 
specific component of the allowance for loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired  there are specific reserve allocations established 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan 
at december   the specific component of the allowance increased by million to million from  at december  nonperforming assets and delinquent loans nonperforming loans include loans past due days and still accruing interest  loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition 

table of contents generally commercial  commercial real estate and constructions loans are placed on non accrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due and or management deems the collectability of the principal and or interest to be in question 
loans to customers whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non accrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as non accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs at time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  the book values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and or market indications 
write downs are recorded for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
we are actively marketing properties acquired through foreclosure 
given current economic conditions and the uncertainty regarding the real estate market  the time involved to sell these properties has extended  resulting in higher levels of other real estate owned and associated maintenance costs in days past due loans are loans for which principal or interest payments become days past due but that still accrue interest since they are loans that are well secured and in the process of collection

in the banking industry  interest bearing obligations are principally utilized to fund interest earning assets 
as such  interest charges on related contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows form interest earning assets 
includes  of unamortized broker commissions 
purchase obligations exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
our operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities  equipment  and certain software or data processing 
purchase obligations at december  reflect the minimum obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
our purchase obligations include payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorships  software license and telecommunications 
purchase obligations also includes the estimated cash severance amounts not prohibited under the executive compensation restrictions applicable to tarp cpp participants due to employees under employment contracts and arrangements  assuming an involuntary termination date of december  our commitments to fund civic and community investments  which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low income housing  small business real estate  and historic tax credit projects that qualify for cra purposes  are not included in the contractual obligations table above 
the timing and amounts of these commitments are projected based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project s partnership or operating agreement  and could change due to variances in the construction schedule  project revisions  or the cancellation of the project 
we continue to reach out to every market we serve through our community development efforts 
management of capital stockholders equity increased million to billion at december  from million at december  due primarily to an additional million in proceeds  after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses  raised in two common stock capital offerings and the issuance of million preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp cpp during 
table of contents issuance of preferred stock on january   we sold  shares of a newly created class of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b to the treasury as part of the tarp cpp program 
we also issued to the treasury a ten year warrant to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock  or of the aggregate dollar amount of series b preferred shares purchased by the treasury  at an exercise price of per share 
in december as a result of the completion of the offerings  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant held by the us treasury was reduced by percent from  to  shares 
the series b preferred stock and warrants qualify for regulatory tier capital and the preferred stock may be redeemed at any time subject to regulatory approval 
following a redemption of the preferred stock  the warrants may be liquidated by the us treasury  through either a redemption at market prices or through a sale by the us treasury to a third party 
the preferred stock has a dividend rate of for the first five years  increasing to thereafter 
among other things  we are subject to restrictions and conditions including those related to the payment of dividends on our common stock  share repurchases  executive compensation  and corporate governance 
we have deployed this new capital mainly to support prudent new lending in the markets we serve 
refer to emergency economic stabilization act eesa in supervision and regulation and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of item and item  respectively  of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
issuance of common stock in order to maintain a strong balance sheet during this challenging economic period and to complement deposits and borrowings as a funding source for our loan growth  we undertook two common equity raises during the year  in addition to converting existing preferred shares to common capital 
in may  we issued approximately million shares of newly issued common stock at a public offering price of per share 
we granted the underwriters an over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares which they partially exercised and purchased an additional  shares 
the net proceeds from the offering  including the partial exercise of the over allotment option  were approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses 
in june  we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to create a new class of non voting common stock the non voting common stock  and amend and restate the certificate of designations of the company s series a junior nonvoting preferred stock the series a preferred stock to provide  among other things  that the shares of series a preferred stock are convertible only into shares of non voting common stock 
under the amended terms of the series a preferred stock  each share of series a preferred stock is convertible into one share of non voting common stock 
on june   we issued  shares of non voting common stock to gtcr upon notice of conversion by gtcr of all of its  shares of series a preferred stock 
this transaction resulted in a reclassification of preferred stock capital to common stock capital and did not increase total stockholders equity 
the shares of series a preferred stock held and converted by gtcr represented all of the authorized  issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock on such date 
we also entered into an amendment to our existing preemptive and registration rights agreement with gtcr pursuant to which we agree  among other things  to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of non voting common stock for resale under the securities act of on november   we closed an underwritten public offering of common stock  which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  and issued a total of approximately million shares for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions 
of that amount  approximately million was purchased by certain funds managed by gtcr 
in addition  gtcr purchased approximately million of non voting common stock of the company  equating to million shares  through an exercise of its existing preemptive rights 
the net proceeds from both the public offerings  as well as from the sale of non voting common stock  qualify as tangible common equity and tier capital and are being used to further capitalize our subsidiary banks in order to support continued growth and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible fdic assisted acquisition transactions subject to satisfying eligibility requirements to participate in such transactions 
capital measurements a strong capital position relative to the capital adequacy rules that apply to us is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets  and enabling us to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
our capital policy requires that we maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines 
it serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity 
under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  we are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these requirements specify 
table of contents minimum capital ratios  defined as tier and total capital as a percentage of assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories and a leverage ratio calculated as tier capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets 
we have managed our capital ratios to consistently maintain such measurements in excess of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb minimum levels considered to be well capitalized  which is the highest capital category established 
the following table presents our consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the frb to be categorized as well capitalized

as of december   all of our million of outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities debentures are included in tier capital 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital under frb regulations

for further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of december  and  for the company and the banks  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
dividends we declared dividends of per common share during based on the closing stock price at december  of  the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was 
our ability to increase common stock dividends is subject to the applicable restrictions of the cpp relating to the sale of the preferred stock from the tarp program 
please refer to eesa in supervision and regulation of item of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
dividend payments by the company are also subject to the provisions set forth in policies of the frb 
the dividend payout ratio  which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share  was for and for the dividend payout ratio has averaged approximately for the past five years 
stock repurchase program our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the cpp following the sale of the preferred stock to the treasury under the tarp program 
please refer to eesa in supervision and regulation of item of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
in connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the cpp  we terminated our repurchase program in february the restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice 
during we repurchased  shares with a value of per share with all repurchases associated with shares submitted in satisfaction of taxes and or exercise price amounts in connection with the settlement of share based compensation awards 

table of contents market and interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have used derivatives in past years as an interest rate risk management tool and may use such instruments in the future  however we currently do not have any such instruments on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and changes in market rates give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment securities portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies 
our net interest margin increased to during  as compared to at december  during  the declining cost on wholesale funds  short term borrowings and deposits caught up with the downward repricing of our interest earning assets  both resulting from the decline in short term libor rates and prime rate in approximately of the loan portfolio is indexed to libor  of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest  and another of the total loan portfolio  otherwise adjusts with other short term interest rates 
during  we slowed the pace of fixed rate investment securities purchases as compared to therefore  with the continued increase in floating rate loan assets in  the our net interest income has become more sensitive to changes in interest rates at december  as compared to december  we will continue to consider the use of interest rate swaps in the future depending on changes in market rates of interest and our balance sheet structure to further mange our position 
liquidity risk management the objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that we can meet our cash flow requirements  capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner and satisfy regulatory guidelines for liquidity imposed by bank regulators 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements  assessing concentration risks and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events 
liquidity is secured by managing the mix of financial instruments on the balance sheet and expanding potential sources of liquidity 
we manage liquidity at two levels at the holding company level and at the bank subsidiary level 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the holding company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources 
liquidity management is guided by policies formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding market conditions  the level of unfunded commitments and potential future loan and deposit growth 
we also develop and maintain contingency funding plans  which evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
the plans are reviewed and approved annually by the asset and liability committee of each subsidiary bank 
our bank subsidiaries principal sources of funds are client deposits  including large institutional deposits  wholesale market based borrowings  capital contributions by the parent company  and cash from operations 
our bank subsidiaries principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends received from its bank subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior  subordinated and convertible debt  as well as equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt  interest paid to our debt holders  dividends paid to stockholders  and subsidiary funding through capital contributions 
our client deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity for our bank subsidiaries 
at december   of our total assets were funded by client deposits  compared to at december  client deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined to include all deposits less traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars 
time deposits are included as client deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as a funding source  we continue to utilize wholesale funding sources  including brokered deposits  in order to enhance liquidity and to fund our loan growth 
however  during  we made a strategic decision to rely less heavily on brokered deposits as a funding source 
brokered deposits  excluding client cdars  decreased to 
table of contents of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  during the fourth quarter  we notified our brokers of our intent to call million in brokered deposits during the first half of our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits excluding reciprocal cdars to levels no more than of total deposits  and total brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect these threshold limitations to limit our ability to grow 
refer to the section entitled risk factors in item a in this form k for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity 
liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral 
at december   net liquid assets at the bank subsidiaries were million at december  and million at december  net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash outflows from investing activities were billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for prior year 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were billion compared to billion in our subsidiary banks had unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use of million at december  and million at december  our total availability of overnight fed fund borrowings is not a committed line of credit and is dependent upon lender availability 
at december   we also had billion in borrowing capacity through the frb discount window s primary credit program  which includes federal term auction facilities 
our borrowing capacity changes each quarter subject to available collateral and frb discount factors 
during the first half of  we redeemed all of the million in outstanding principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes at a redemption price in cash equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the senior convertible notes were issued in march and paid interest semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum 
the notes were convertible under certain circumstances into cash and  if applicable  shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share and were scheduled to mature on march  during the first quarter  we repaid in full million under the credit facility 
the credit facility matured in the third quarter and was not renewed by us 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements of item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 

table of contents allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including  among other factors  assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period  industry loss averages and historical loss experience 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
goodwill is allocated to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using either market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available  or discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired  a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings 
such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital 
the impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value  step one 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues step two by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill 
the adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
during  in addition to our annual impairment test as of october   we completed an impairment test during the first quarter 
in both tests  the step one analysis conducted for the privatewealth segment indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value including goodwill 
therefore  a step two analysis was not required for this reporting unit 
the step one analysis completed for the banking segment indicated that the carrying value including goodwill of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
the annual valuation utilized market and income approach methodologies and applied a weighted average to each in order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
therefore  a step two analysis was performed for this segment  which indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the banking segment exceeded the carrying value including goodwill and no impairment charge was recorded in goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows  as well as other prevailing market factors 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment 
in connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation  management provides certain information and assumptions that is utilized in the implied fair value calculation 
assumptions critical to the process include discount rates  asset and liability growth rates  and other income and expense estimates 
we provided the best information currently available to estimate future performance for each reporting unit  however  future adjustments to these projections may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions utilized in making these assumptions 

table of contents identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
all of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding years and include core deposit premiums that use an accelerated method of amortization and client relationship intangibles and assembled workforce which are amortized on a straight line basis 
income taxes the determination of income tax expense or benefit  and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on a complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
we are subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities 
such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities  will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely  based on a standard of more likely than not 
in making this assessment  we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through a the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  b future taxable income  c the possible application of future tax planning strategies  and d carryback to taxable income in prior years 
we have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at december  however  there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we have concluded  as of december   that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in the preparation of income tax returns  tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain 
we periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized 
the amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed including interest 
these estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return  such as tax authority audits  court decisions or other tax law interpretations 
there can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed 
at december   we had  of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the company s effective tax rate if recognized in future periods 
for additional discussion of income taxes  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
our asset liability management policy is established by the business risk committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
one way to estimate the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is a gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to re pricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 

table of contents we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated income statement 
the following tables present the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of december  and analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities dollars in thousands year ended december  days days years over years total interest earnings assets fed funds sold securities available for sale non marketable equity investments net loans net covered assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits money market accounts brokered deposits other time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities cumulative rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl gap gap rsa rsl rsa rsl rsa to total assets rsl to total assets gap to total assets gap to total rsa 
table of contents year ended december  days days years over years total interest earnings assets fed funds sold securities fhlb stock net loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits money market accounts brokered deposits other time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities cumulative rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl gap gap rsa rsl rsa rsl rsa to total assets rsl to total assets gap to total assets gap to total rsa our primary way of estimating the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is through the use of a simulation model based on our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios  assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant throughout the twelve month measurement period 
the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then re price based on current terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of december  and december  analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollars in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change 
as an example  this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by million or over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of million or if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  changes in the effect on net interest income at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the re pricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
while the percent of net interest income is relatively consistent across the rate scenarios  the absolute dollar impact has increased in each scenario due to increases in 
table of contents our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios 
during  we slowed the growth in our fixed rate bond portfolio relative to the slowing of our fixed rate bond portfolio  and continued floating rate loan growth  funded by an increasing percentage of client deposits results in a balance sheet more sensitive to interest rate changes at december  compared to december  as the absolute level of short term rates has dropped  more of our loans are approaching or hitting their floors  which has the result of moderating further rate sensitivity in falling rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  purchase or sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
