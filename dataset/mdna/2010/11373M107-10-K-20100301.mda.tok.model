competition the company faces significant competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits 
the boston metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  many of which are branches of significantly larger institutions which have greater financial resources than the company  and all of which are competitors of the company to varying degrees 
the company s competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking companies  credit unions  insurance companies and other financial service companies 
its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the company faces additional competition for deposits from non depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry  securities and brokerage firms  and insurance companies 
personnel as of december   the company had full time employees and part time employees 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and the company considers its relationship with its employees to be good 
supervision and regulation general the bank is a federally chartered stock savings institution subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the office of thrift supervision ots and  to a lesser extent  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the bank is also regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system with respect to reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage 
under this system of federal regulation  financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates 
the ots examines the bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies 
any change in these laws or regulations  whether by the fdic  the ots or congress  could have a material adverse impact on the company and the bank and their operations 
federal banking regulation business activities 
a federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act  as amended  and the regulations of the ots 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including real estate investment and securities brokerage 

table of contents capital requirements 
ots regulations require federal savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage ratio for savings associations receiving the highest rating on the camels rating system and an risk based capital ratio 
the risk based capital standard for federal savings banks requires the maintenance of tier core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight factor of to  assigned by the ots  based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset 
core capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock  the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and up to of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values 
overall  the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of core capital 
additionally  a savings bank that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser s recourse against the savings bank 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual banks where necessary 
at december   the bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
loans to one borrower 
generally  a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be loaned  equal to of unimpaired capital and surplus  if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral  which generally does not include real estate 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with the loans to one borrower limitations 
qualified thrift lender test 
as a federal savings bank  the bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender  or qtl  test 
under the qtl test  the bank must maintain at least of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments in at least nine months of the most recent month period 
portfolio assets generally means total assets of a federal savings bank  less the sum of specified liquid assets up to of total assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the value of property used in the conduct of the bank s business 
qualified thrift investments includes various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities  and loans for personal  family  household and certain other purposes up to a limit of of portfolio assets 
qualified thrift investments also include of a federal savings bank s credit card loans  education loans and small business loans 
a federal savings bank that fails the qualified thrift lender test must either convert to a commercial bank charter or operate under specified restrictions set forth in the home owners loan act 
at december   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
capital distributions 
ots regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank  which include cash dividends  stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings bank s capital account 
a federal savings bank must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the bank s net income for that year to date plus the bank s retained net income for the preceding two years  the bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  the distribution would violate any applicable statute  regulation  agreement or ots imposed condition  or the bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings 
even if an application is not otherwise required  every federal savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the ots at least days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution 

table of contents the ots may disapprove a notice or application if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution  if after making such distribution  the institution would be undercapitalized 
liquidity 
a federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation 
community reinvestment act and fair lending laws 
all federal savings banks have a responsibility under the community reinvestment act and related regulations of the ots to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income borrowers 
in conducting an examination of a federal savings bank  the ots is required to assess the bank s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
a savings bank s failure to comply with the provisions of the community reinvestment act could  at a minimum  result in regulatory restrictions on its activities 
the failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions by the ots  as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice 
the bank received a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating in its most recent examination conducted by the ots 
transactions with related parties 
a federal savings bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by sections a and b of the federal reserve act the fra and its implementing regulation w promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
the term affiliates for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an insured depository institution 
the company and its non savings bank subsidiary are affiliates of the bank 
in general  transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements 
in addition  ots regulations prohibit a bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate  other than a subsidiary 
finally  transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  not involve low quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
the ots requires savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers and or higher shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the federal reserve board 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders i be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features  and ii not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit to insiders must be approved by the bank s board of directors 
enforcement 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties which includes officers  directors  stockholders and attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on the institution 
formal enforcement action by the ots may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and or directors of the institution  and the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions  and range up to  per day  unless a finding of reckless disregard is made  in which case penalties may be as high as million per day 
the fdic also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take action under specified circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions 
these standards relate to  among other things  internal controls  information systems and audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation  and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate 
interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions 
table of contents before capital becomes impaired 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan 
failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action  including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is authorized and  under certain circumstances  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions 
for this purpose  a federal savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than leverage capital  tier risk based capital or total risk based capital  significantly undercapitalized less than leverage capital  tier risk based capital or total risk based capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 
generally  the ots is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is critically undercapitalized within specific timeframes 
the regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the bank  including  but not limited to  restrictions on growth  investment activities  capital distributions and affiliate transactions 
any holding company for a savings bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to of the bank s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the ots  or the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status 
this guarantee remains in place until the ots notifies the bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters  and the ots has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee 
failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the bank  such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends  pay executive compensation and management fees  and increase assets or expand operations 
the ots may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
at december   the bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the bank is a member of the deposit insurance fund  which is administered by the fdic 
deposit accounts in the bank are insured by the fdic  generally up to a maximum of  for each separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of  for self directed retirement accounts

see temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and  prior to  ranged from five to basis points of the institution s deposits 
on december   the fdic issued a final rule that raises the current deposit insurance assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by seven basis points to a range from to basis points effective for the first quarter of on february   the fdic issued a final rule that alters the way it calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of and thereafter 
under the rule  the fdic first establishes an institution s initial base assessment rate 
this initial base assessment rate ranges  depending on the risk category of the institution  from to basis points 
the fdic then adjusts the initial base assessment higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
the adjustments to the initial base assessment rate are based upon an institution s levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate ranges from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
additionally  on may   the fdic issued a final rule that imposed a special five basis points assessment on each fdic insured depository institution s assets  minus its tier capital on june   which was collected on september  the special assessment is capped at basis points of an institution s domestic deposits 
future special assessments could also be assessed 
we incurred expense of  during the quarter ended june  as a result of the special assessment 

table of contents the fdic adopted a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions are required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and this pre payment  which was due on december   amounted to  for the bank 
the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of and for is based on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and will be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points 
in addition  each institution s base assessment rate for each period will be calculated using its third quarter assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of the pre payment has been recorded as a prepaid expense at december  and will be amortized to expense over three years 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
we do not currently know of any practice  condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance 
in addition to the fdic assessments  the financing corporation fico is authorized to impose and collect  with the approval of the fdic  assessments for anticipated payments  issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the fico in the s to recapitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation

the other component of the program provides full federal deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  regardless of dollar amount  until june  through december  an annualized basis point assessment on balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  was assessed on a quarterly basis to insured depository institutions that have not opted out of this component of the program 
beginning january   institutions that have not opted out of this component of the program will be subject to increased quarterly fees  the amount of which will be based on the institution s risk category rating assigned with respect to regular fdic assessments 
institutions in risk category i generally well capitalized institutions with composite camels or ratings will pay an annualized assessment rate of basis points 
institutions in risk category ii generally adequately capitalized institutions with composite camels or better will pay an annualized assessment rate of basis points 
institutions in risk category iii or iv generally under capitalized or composite camels or will pay an annualized assessment rate of basis points 
we opted to participate in this component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program

table of contents item a 
risk factors changes to interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the company makes most of its earnings based on the difference between interest it earns compared to interest it pays 
this difference is called the interest spread 
the company earns interest on loans and  to a much lesser extent  on securities and short term investments 
these are called interest earning assets 
the company pays interest on some forms of deposits and on funds it borrows from other sources 
these are called interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest earning assets change compared to when interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities change 
some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on the company s books 
other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities at different rates 
it may be difficult to replace interest earning assets quickly  since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high  or the company may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards 
the company s interest spread may also change based on the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest earning assets compared to its interest bearing liabilities 
for example  if interest rates go down  the company will earn less on some of its interest earning assets while it is still locked into paying higher rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities 
on the other hand  if interest rates go up  the company might have to pay more on some of its interest bearing liabilities while it is still locked in to receiving lower rates on some of its interest earning assets 
while the company manages this risk using different techniques  future fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant adverse effect on its operating results 
changes in our asset quality could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant part of the company s loan portfolio billion is concentrated in commercial  multi family  residential and construction loans secured by real estate located primarily in eastern massachusetts 
property values have declined during the past two years 
further declines could cause the company to experience a higher level of loan losses in coming years 
in addition to real estate loans  the company s loan portfolio includes million of indirect automobile loans  million of loans to finance equipment to small businesses and million of other commercial loans underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  assets pledged as collateral and personal guarantees 
recent weakness in the economy has affected the ability of borrowers to repay loans in the past two years and could result in a further increase in loan losses in and possibly thereafter 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings would decrease 
the company is exposed to the risk that customers will not be able to repay their loans 
this risk is inherent in the lending business 
there is also the risk that the customers collateral will not be sufficient to cover the balance of their loans  as underlying collateral values fluctuate with market changes 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio  based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors 
while the company seeks to use the best available information to make its evaluations  and at december   management believed that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio  it is possible that borrower defaults could exceed the current estimates for loan losses 
in addition  future increases to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  results of regulatory examinations  further information obtained regarding known problem loans  increasing charge offs of existing problem loans  or the identification of additional problem loans and other factors 
the occurrence of these events could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the cost of acquisitions and other growth initiatives could have an adverse effect on earnings 
in january  the company acquired mystic and  in april  the company increased its ownership interest in eastern 
additionally  in recent years  the company has recruited experienced loan officers to expand commercial business lending and  in  recruited personnel to expand cash management services and to offer investment advisory services 
while acquisitions and other growth activities are important to the long term success of the company  there are risks associated with such initiatives 
the initiatives often require investments and expenditures that can have a negative effect on 
table of contents operating results in the short term and cause significant adverse consequences if the initiatives are not executed satisfactorily 
competitor initiatives could make it difficult for us to sustain adequate profitability 
the company faces significant competition for loans and deposits from other banks and financial institutions both within and beyond its local market place 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we do and may offer products and services that we do not  or cannot  provide 
many competitors are also willing to offer loans at lower rates or deposits at higher rates than the company is offering 
to compete with the pricing offered by competitors can result in lower profitability for the company 
changes in federal and state regulation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments 
banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors  not stockholders 
banking laws and rules can change at any time 
the government agencies responsible for supervising the company s business can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules  even if the rules themselves do not change 
we need to make sure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules 
we might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply 
our business might suffer in other ways as well 
changes in state and federal tax laws can make our business less profitable 
changes in the accounting rules we are required to follow may also make us less profitable 
changes in the government s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans 
changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business 
the government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially 
they can force us to hold additional capital  pay higher deposit insurance premiums  stop paying dividends  stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits 
if the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps  it would probably make our business less profitable 
systems failures  interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business  as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships  our general ledger  our deposits and our loans 
while we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures  interruptions and security breaches  there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do 
in addition  any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our web site and our online banking service  both of which involve the transmission of confidential information 
although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data  these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security 
in addition  we outsource certain of our data processing to certain third party providers 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties  or if we have difficulty in communication with them  our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected  and our business operations could be adversely impacted 
threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors 
the occurrence of any systems failure  interruption  or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in technology could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
the provision of financial products and services is highly dependent on technology 
our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively  and in a cost efficient manner  is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available 
many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology driven products and services 
the ability to keep pace with technological change is important  and the failure to do so on our part could have a material adverse impact on our business and  therefore  on our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic environment in the second half of and throughout  the national economy plunged into recession and unemployment rose to over 
while the economy in massachusetts and  in particular  the greater boston metropolitan area remained relatively stable  unemployment nonetheless rose to levels not seen in over the past thirty years 
the deterioration in the economy made it difficult for some of the company s loan customers to make their loan payments and  as a result  the company experienced elevated loan losses  particularly in its auto and eastern loan portfolios 
while there have been signs recently that the economy has started to gradually improve  we expect the operating environment in to remain challenging 
we implemented more conservative underwriting criteria over the past eighteen months and intend to continue applying such criteria in the volume of loan originations and loan losses will depend  to a large extent  on how the economy functions 
loan and deposit growth is also greatly influenced by the rate setting actions of the federal open market committee the 
table of contents fomc of the federal reserve system 
the fomc lowered the rate for overnight federal fund borrowings between banks dramatically from in september to a target range between zero and in december  the rate currently in effect 
in  the interest rate environment had a significant effect on deposit flows and yields earned on investments and loans 
rising rates in the future could cause changes in the mix and volume of the company s deposits and make it more difficult for certain borrowers to be eligible for new loans or to service their existing debt 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to understanding our financial condition and operating results 
such accounting policies are considered to be especially important because they involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our operating results or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
additions to the allowance are made through provisions for loan losses charged to operating earnings 
loan losses are charged off in the period loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the determination of the loans on which full collectibility is not reasonably assured  the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral and the assessment of economic and other conditions are subject to assumptions and judgments by management 
valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in  or different interpretations of  these assumptions and judgments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and reviews its conclusion as to the amount to be established with the watch committee and the audit committee 
the watch committee is comprised of the lead independent director of the board of directors  the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  the chief credit officer  the senior lending officer and several other lending officers representing the loan segments of the company 
the audit committee was comprised of three independent directors in and will be comprised of five independent directors in specific valuation allowances are established in connection with individual loan reviews and the asset classification process  including the procedures for determination of impairment 
a loan is deemed impaired when  based on current information and other factors  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan 
evaluation procedures are applied to all loans except smaller balance homogenous loans 
loan evaluation considers the appraised value of a loan s underlying collateral  loan payment history  the impact that local real estate market conditions may have on collateral values  the impact that current economic and business conditions may have on a borrower  current and historical experience of similar loans  internal and regulatory risk ratings  and the direction of interest rates 
for multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans  the following additional factors related to the borrower or the underlying collateral are considered occupancy levels for the property  the composition of tenants  cash flow estimates and the financial strength of personal guarantors 
the company utilizes an internal rating system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in its loans 
ratings assigned to larger loans are subject to periodic review by a credit officer 
adverse internal ratings are assigned to loans that are either not performing or exhibit certain weaknesses that could jeopardize payment in accordance with the original terms 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews with the watch committee the status of each loan assigned one of the company s four adverse internal ratings and the judgments made in determining the valuation allowances allocated to such loans 
the allowance for loan losses attributed to the remainder of the loan portfolio  including homogenous indirect automobile  residential mortgage  home equity and other consumer loans  is established based on an evaluation of various factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  historical and recent trends in charge offs  delinquencies and collateral values  geographic and industry concentrations  changes in internal risk ratings  other portfolio characteristics and current economic conditions 
while management seeks to use the best available information to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  results of regulatory examinations  the obtaining of further information regarding known or yet to be identified problem loans  and other factors 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if fair value exceeds the carrying amount at the time of testing  goodwill is not considered impaired 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are considered to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in 
table of contents valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
goodwill impairment testing was performed for the company and eastern 
the annual goodwill impairment test of the company was performed as of november   using the quoted market price of the company s common stock as of that date 
on that basis  we determined that the fair value of the company was in excess of its carrying value 
we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test of eastern as of november  in the past  the annual goodwill assessment relating to eastern was performed as of december due to time constraints in the annual closing process  we changed the date of the annual evaluation to november the change did not have any significant effect on the valuation process and results 
due to the absence of a quoted market price  the following factors were evaluated to determine whether the goodwill related to eastern had been impaired eastern s operating performance since our acquisition of a controlling interest in april  the soundness of eastern s business fundamentals  eastern s projected operating results for the next five years  the acquisition premium that a willing buyer would have to pay for the company to recover its investment in eastern and the present value of projected cash flows 
based on our evaluation of those factors  we concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
investment securities securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of our securities  particularly our fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
on a quarterly basis  we review and evaluate fair value based on market data obtained from independent sources or  in the absence of active market data  from model derived valuations based on market assumptions 
if we deem any decline to be other than temporary  the amount of impairment loss recorded in earnings for a debt security is the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value if we intend to sell the debt security prior to recovery or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
if  however  we do not intend to sell the debt security or we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery  the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment of a debt security is recognized as a charge to earnings and the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in comprehensive income 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary loss is determined based on our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
impairment losses charged to earnings in  and were   and none  respectively 
financial condition the company s financial condition as of december   december  and december  included the following highlights loan growth of million in and million in deposit growth excluding brokered deposits of million in and million in non performing assets of million of total assets at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  allowance for loan losses of million of total loans at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  reduction in borrowed funds and subordinated debt to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  stockholders equity of million of total assets at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  total assets grew million in compared to million in the modest growth in was due primarily to a million reduction in short term investments and a million reduction in indirect automobile auto loans outstanding 
with the average yield on short term investments declining from in to in  it was not beneficial to earnings to maintain high balances in short term investments 
the decline in auto loans 
table of contents outstanding was attributable primarily to the lower volume of sales experienced by auto manufacturers which led to lower loan origination opportunities 
until the economy improves  it is possible that we may experience a further decline in auto loans outstanding 
excluding auto loans  the loan portfolio grew million in and million in commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans grew million in and million in this loan growth was due in part to changes in the competitive landscape 
some of the market participants who were lenient in their underwriting reduced their origination activity as they began to experience higher levels of non performing loans and loan losses 
this development resulted in more rational market conditions and enabled us to compete more effectively for quality commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans 
residential mortgage loans grew million in  but declined million in due to lower market rates  the company decided to reduce its origination of residential mortgage loans in also contributing to loan growth were increases in commercial loans of million in and million in  increases in eastern loans of million and million and increases in home equity loans of million and million in those respective years 
despite weakened economic conditions  non performing assets remained modest in relation to total assets 
the allowance for loan losses was increased in each of the past three years in light of overall loan growth and higher loan losses and loan delinquencies  especially in the auto and eastern loan portfolios 
a substantial part of the growth in total deposits excluding brokered deposits in and all of the growth in total deposits in was in money market savings deposits 
those deposits increased million in and million in while certificates of deposit declined million in  they increased million in certificates of deposit comprised of total deposits excluding brokered deposits at december  compared to at december  and at december  we believe the growth in deposits was due in part to the desire of certain depositors to place their funds in financial institutions with strong capital and also to our efforts to gather deposits from existing customer relationships 
the shift in the mix of deposits was attributable primarily to the significant decline in rates offered on deposits 
depositors chose to place funds in more liquid accounts rather than in certificates of deposit with longer term maturities 
with the influx of deposits in  some of those funds were used to pay off brokered deposits and borrowings from the fhlb 
the decline in stockholders equity in and resulted primarily from the payment of semi annual extra dividends of per share which exceeded earnings and  accordingly  represented a return of capital to stockholders 
payment of semi annual extra dividends was ceased after the per share payment to stockholders in february operating results highlights from the results of operations for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows improvement in net interest margin to in from in and in receipt of  of interest income in resulting from the payoff of a loan on which there was unaccreted discount

table of contents highlights from the preceding table follow 
interest income in included  that resulted from full payment of a mortgage loan in the second quarter on which there was unaccreted discount 
excluding that income  net interest income was higher in than in the increase was due primarily to loan and deposit growth and improvement in net interest margin 
net interest income was higher in than in due to loan and deposit growth offset in part by a decline in net interest margin 
the average balance of interest earning assets grew million between and and million between and all of the asset growth resulted from loan growth of million between and and million between and the yield on the average balance of short term investments declined from in to in and in  reflecting the rate setting actions of the fomc described earlier herein 
the decline in the yield on the average balance of equity securities from in to in and in was due primarily to the elimination of dividend income on fhlb stock owned by the company 
the average balance of deposits  excluding brokered deposits  increased million between and and million between and the average balance of non interest bearing demand checking accounts increased million and million between those respective periods 
the average balance of certificates of deposit  excluding brokered deposits  expressed as a percent of the average balance of total deposits  excluding brokered deposits  declined from in to in and in the average balance comprised of money market savings accounts increased from to and in those respective periods 
since money market savings accounts can be withdrawn at any time  interest rates paid on those deposits are generally lower than interest rates paid on certificates of deposit 
we believe the shift in the mix of deposits was attributable in part to the desire of depositors to have their funds placed in more liquid accounts during this time of weakened economic conditions 
the average balance of brokered deposits declined from million in to million in and million in these funds were obtained in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in eastern and were used to pay off existing debt obligations of eastern 
when obtained  the rates on the brokered deposits compared favorably to other alternative forms of borrowings 
brokered deposits were paid in full in the second quarter 
interest rate spread improved from in to in and in excluding the  of interest income referred to above 
the improvement in spread resulted primarily from more rapid reductions in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds than in rates earned on loans and investments 
net interest margin increased to in excluding the  of interest income referred to above from in and in the improvement in was attributable to the matters mentioned above 
the decline in was due in part to foregone interest income resulting from a million reduction in the average balance of stockholders equity between and caused primarily by the payment of semi annual extra dividends and repurchase of the company s common stock

us government sponsored enterprises debt securities of us government sponsored enterprises include obligations issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  the federal home loan banks and the federal farm credit bank 
none of those obligations is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 

table of contents in  most of the company s investment purchases were debt securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises with maturities primarily in the eighteen month to thirty month range 
the company concentrated on acquiring debt securities with short maturities to reduce interest rate risk during a period of uncertainty as to the direction of interest rates 
as us government sponsored enterprises experienced rising losses and capital erosion in  especially fnma and freddie mac  we decided to stop purchasing debt securities issued by them 
in  we recommenced the purchase of debt securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises 
as of december   the securities purchased will mature primarily within three years from that date 
municipal obligations and auction rate municipal obligations the company owned only one remaining municipal obligation at december   it matures on august  and was rated aaa by a rating firm at that date 
auction rate municipal obligations are debt securities issued by municipal  county and state entities that are generally repaid from revenue sources such as hospitals  transportation systems  student education loans and property taxes 
the securities are not obligations of the issuing government entity 
the obligations are variable rate securities with long term maturities whose interest rates are set periodically through an auction process 
the auction period typically ranges from days to days 
the reduction in the amount invested in such obligations in and resulted from redemptions at par by issuers 
the auction rate obligations owned by the company were rated aaa at the time of acquisition due  in part  to the guarantee of third party insurers who would have to pay the obligations if the issuers failed to pay the obligations when they become due 
in the first quarter  public disclosures indicated that certain third party insurers were experiencing financial difficulties and  therefore  might not be able to meet their contractual obligations 
as a result  auctions failed to attract a sufficient number of investors and created a liquidity problem for those investors who were relying on the obligations to be redeemed at auction 
since then  there has not been an active market for auction rate municipal obligations 
based on an evaluation of market factors  the estimated fair value of the auction rate municipal obligations owned by the company at december  was  or  less than their face value 
full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial condition of the issuers is sound  none of the issuers has defaulted on scheduled payments  the obligations are rated investment grade and we have the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
corporate obligations in  the company increased its investment in corporate obligations in order to diversify its investment portfolio and improve the overall yield on investments 
the corporate debt securities owned at december  will mature primarily within three years 
included in corporate obligations are investments in preferred trust securities pretsls that were acquired several years ago 
pretsls represent investment instruments comprised of a pool of trust preferred securities that are debt obligations issued by a number of financial institutions and insurance companies 
the investment instruments can be segregated into tranches segments that establish priority rights to cash flows from the underlying trust preferred securities 
at december   the company owned two pools of trust preferred securities  pretsl vi and pretsl xxviii 
the unpaid balance of pretsl vi was  at december  one of the issuers  representing of the pool  has deferred regularly scheduled interest payments 
due to the lack of an orderly market for this security  its fair value was determined to be  at december  based on analytical modeling taking into consideration a range of factors normally found in an orderly market 
of the  unrealized loss on the security  based on an analysis of projected cash flows   was charged to earnings in as a credit impairment loss and  was charged to other comprehensive income in the unpaid balance of pretsl xxviii was  at december  and the estimated fair value based on factors similar to those used to value the security mentioned in the preceding paragraph was  at that date 
the unrealized loss of  was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because the security is rated investment grade  we have first priority to future cash redemptions and over of the issuers in the pool would have to default before recovery of our investment could be in doubt 
none of the issuers comprising the pool represent more than of the entire pool 
nine issuers representing approximately of the remaining aggregate investment pool at december  were in default at that date 
at december   the aggregate carrying value of other trust preferred securities owned by the company was  and the aggregate market value was  the aggregate unrealized loss on these securities of  
table of contents was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because of the financial soundness and prospects of the issuers and our ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
mortgage securities the company also invests in mortgage related securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these securities are considered attractive investments because they a generate positive yields with minimal administrative expense  b impose minimal credit risk as a result of the guarantees usually provided  c can be utilized as collateral for borrowings  d generate cash flows useful for liquidity management and e are qualified thrift investments for purposes of the thrift lender test that the company is obliged to meet for regulatory purposes 
mortgage related securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the average interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage related securities purchased by the company generally are comprised of a pool of single family mortgages 
the issuers of such securities are generally us government sponsored enterprises such as fnma  freddie mac and gnma who pool and resell participation interests in the form of securities to investors and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to the investors 
investments in mortgage related securities issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises generally do not entail significant credit risk 
such investments  however  are susceptible to significant interest rate and cash flow risks when actual cash flows from the investments differ from cash flows estimated at the time of purchase 
additionally  the market value of such securities can be affected adversely by market changes in interest rates 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of a security and result in the accelerated expensing of any premiums paid  thereby reducing the net yield earned on the security 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of declining interest rates  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of underlying mortgages and the related security 
such an occurrence can also create reinvestment risk because of the unavailability of other investments with a comparable rate of return in relation to the nature and maturity of the alternative investment 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments may decline  thereby extending the estimated life of the security and depriving the company of the ability to reinvest cash flows at the higher market rates of interest 
cmos are a type of debt security issued by a special purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage related securities and creates different classes of cmo securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics 
the cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches  or classes  whereby tranches have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest repayment of the underlying mortgages and mortgage related securities  as opposed to pass through mortgage backed securities where cash flows are distributed pro rata to all security holders 
in contrast to mortgage backed securities from which cash flow is received pro rata by all security holders and hence  prepayment risk is shared  the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage related securities underlying cmos is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities 
a particular tranche of a cmo may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches 
generally  the company has invested in the first tranche of cmos 
mortgage securities acquired in  and were purchased mostly because of their higher yield in relation to other investment possibilities and their guarantee by the issuing us government sponsored enterprises 
in  million of mortgage backed securities were sold to reduce the company s investment concentration in mortgage backed securities in a rising interest rate environment 
marketable equity securities at december   the company owned marketable equity securities with a fair value of  including net unrealized gains of  and net unrealized losses of  the securities include perpetual preferred stock originally issued by merrill lynch co  inc now bank of america with a fair value of  and stocks of banks and utility companies with an aggregate fair value of restricted equity securities at december   the company owned stock in the fhlb with a carrying value of million 
at december   the fhlb had total assets of billion and total capital of billion  of which million was retained earnings 
based on information available as of september   the fhlb was classified as adequately capitalized by its regulator 

table of contents the fhlb s capital at december  included accumulated comprehensive losses of billion relating to the non credit portion of other than temporary losses on held to maturity securities 
such securities included private label mortgage backed securities owned by the fhlb with an amortized cost of billion 
in the future  if unrealized losses on the fhlb s private label mortgage backed securities are deemed to be other than temporary related credit losses  the associated impairment charges could put into question whether the fair value of the fhlb stock owned by the company is less than its carrying value 
the fhlb has stated that it expects and intends to hold its private label mortgage backed securities to maturity 
the company will continue to monitor its investment in fhlb stock

the company also provides financing for construction and development projects  home equity and second mortgage loans  and other consumer loans 
the company relies on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers  attorneys and other professionals to generate loans 
in addition  existing borrowers are an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the company 
the company s ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy  trends in interest rates  customer demands and competition 
many of the company s borrowers have done business with the company for years and have more than one loan outstanding 
it is the company s current policy that the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any one borrower or related entities may not exceed million unless approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
at december   one borrower had aggregate loans outstanding of million that were approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
including that borrower  there were borrowers each with aggregate loans outstanding of million or greater at december  the cumulative total of those loans was million  or of loans outstanding excluding indirect automobile loans  home equity loans and other consumer loans 
most of this cumulative amount is comprised of multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans and other commercial loans 
the company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination 
the policies address approval limits  loan to value ratios  appraisal requirements  debt service coverage ratios  loan concentration limits and other matters relevant to loan underwriting 
multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans a number of factors are considered in originating multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower including credit history  profitability and expertise  as well as the value and condition of the underlying property  are evaluated 
when evaluating the qualifications of the borrower  the company considers the financial resources of the borrower  the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with the company and other financial institutions 
factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of net operating income to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value 

table of contents frequently  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans are made for five to ten year terms  with an amortization period of twenty to twenty five years 
many of the loans originated in the past few years have been priced at inception on a fixed rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to seven years 
to reduce risk in a rising interest rate environment  occasionally the company has partially funded fixed rate loans by borrowing funds from the fhlb on a fixed rate basis for periods that approximate the fixed rate terms of the loans 
generally  a yield maintenance fee and other fees are collected when a fixed rate loan is paid off prior to its maturity 
competition for multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans  which had been intense for a few years  began to ease in the latter part of loan pricing  which had been especially aggressive  started to improve 
with that improvement  we became more active in originating loans in those lending segments 
as a result  multi family mortgage loans grew million in and million in but declined million in  and commercial real estate mortgage loans grew million in  million in and million in over of the multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans outstanding at december  are secured by properties located in massachusetts 
the commercial real estate portfolio at that date is comprised primarily of loans secured by retail stores million  office buildings million  mixed use properties million and industrial properties million 
one to four family mortgage loans the company offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences 
generally  fixed rate residential mortgage loans with maturities beyond ten years are not maintained in the company s loan portfolio 
one to four family mortgage loans increased by million in and million in but declined by million in favorable market conditions enabled the growth in as loan pricing became more competitive in  we decided to reduce our origination of residential mortgage loans 
construction and development loans construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long term financing on improved  occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs  the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy  and market conditions 
if the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted with a project which  upon completion  has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment 
criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project 
for those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property  in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans  the company also analyzes project costs  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and demand within the market area 
for those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project  the company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates 
historically  construction and development lending has been a modest part of the company s loan originations 
at december   construction and development loans equaled million or of total loans outstanding at that date 
included in the portfolio is one potential problem loan with an outstanding balance of  this represents our participation in a unit condominium development project which is experiencing slow sales as a result of a stalled real estate market 
the loan is current and of the loan balance is guaranteed by an individual with the desire and financial resources to work through current market conditions 
we classified the loan substandard and established a reserve of  as of december  commercial loans eastern the eastern loan portfolio  which amounted to million at december   grew million in  million in and million in the portfolio is comprised primarily of loans to finance coin operated laundry  dry cleaning and convenience store equipment and businesses 
the borrowers are located primarily in the metropolitan new york area  although the customer base extends to locations throughout the united states of america 
typically  the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over their three to seven year life 
in some instances  the life of a loan can extend to ten years 
eastern focuses on making loans to customers with business experience 
an important part of eastern s loan originations comes from existing customers as they expand their operations and acquire additional stores 
the size of loan that eastern is willing to make is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the store and equipment to 
table of contents be financed 
eastern has developed a base of data of the revenue and profitability of stores it has financed 
it has also accumulated data on the prices at which stores have sold 
eastern s loan policy contains limits on the multiples of revenues and earnings that can be applied to derive an estimate of the value of a store to be financed 
the yields earned on eastern s loans are higher than those earned on commercial loans made by brookline because they involve a higher degree of credit risk 
eastern s customers are typically small business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who are more at risk when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise 
because of these characteristics  personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets 
other commercial loans other commercial loans  which amounted to million at december  included loans to condominium associations of million 
commercial loans grew million in  million in and million in the growth resulted from the hiring of senior officers with extensive experience in commercial lending 
the company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market area 
product offerings include lines of credit  term loans  letters of credit  deposit services and cash management 
these types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of a business 
interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed rate basis referenced on the fhlb index 
credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of an analysis of their financial statements  the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and  in most instances  the personal guarantee of the owner of the business 
we also participate in us government programs such as the small business administration in both the a program and as a sba preferred lender 
loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements  are made for five to ten year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues 
among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy  the financial condition and history of the condominium association  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made 
depending on loan size  funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and  in more complex situations  after completion of engineering inspections 
indirect automobile auto loans auto loans amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the reduction in auto loans in resulted from lower loan originations as the auto industry experienced lower sales and lenders affiliated with auto manufacturers offered loan terms at low rates which we chose not to match 
the loans are for the purchase of automobiles both new and used and light duty trucks primarily to individuals  but also to corporations and other organizations 
the loans are originated through dealerships and assigned to the company 
the vice president responsible for auto lending must approve the application of any dealer with whom the company does business 
the company does business with over dealerships located primarily in massachusetts  connecticut  rhode island and new hampshire 
dealer relationships are reviewed periodically for application quality  the ratio of loans approved to applications submitted and loan performance 
loan applications are generated by approved dealers and data are entered into an application processing system 
a credit bureau scorecard model is used in the underwriting process 
the model is based on data accumulated by nationally recognized credit bureaus and is a risk assessment tool that analyzes an individual s credit history and assigns a numeric credit score 
the model meets the requirements of the equal credit opportunity act 
the application processing system statistically grades each application according to score ranges 
depending on the data received  an application is either approved or denied automatically or submitted to a credit underwriter for review 
credit underwriters may override system designated approvals 
loans approved by the underwriters must meet criteria guidelines established in the company s loan policy 
credit profile measurements such as debt to income ratios  payment to income ratios and loan to value ratios are utilized in the underwriting process and to monitor the performance of loans falling within specified ratio ranges 
regarding loan to value ratios  the company considers auto loans to be essentially credits that are only partially collateralized 
when borrowers cease to make required payments  repossession and sale of the vehicle financed usually results in insufficient funds to fully pay the remaining loan balance 

table of contents the company s auto loan policy limits the aggregate amount of loans with credit scores of less than to of loans outstanding 
at december   loans with credit scores below were approximately of loans outstanding 
the average dollar weighted credit score of loans in the portfolio at that date was see the subsection provision for credit losses auto loans appearing elsewhere herein for further information regarding loan underwriting and the average credit scores of the borrowers to whom auto loans were made 
auto loans are assigned a particular tier based on the credit score determined by the credit bureau 
the tier is used for pricing purposes only so as to assure consistency in loan pricing 
tier rates can be modified if certain conditions exist as outlined in the company s loan policy 
the rate paid by a borrower usually differs with the buy rate earned by the company 
a significant part of the difference between the two rates is retained by the dealer in accordance with terms agreed to between the dealer and the company 
the difference is commonly referred to as the spread 
most of the spread is paid after the end of the month in which the loan is made and is comprised of the agreed upon rate differential multiplied by the expected average balance of the loan over its scheduled maturity 
if a loan is repaid in entirety within days of the loan origination date  the dealer must pay the remainder of unamortized spread to the company 
if a loan is repaid after ninety days  the dealer is not obliged to repay any part of the spread amount previously received 
spread payments to dealers are amortized as a reduction of interest received from borrowers over the life of the related loans 
when loans are prepaid  any remaining unamortized balance is charged to expense at that time 
various reports are generated to monitor receipt of required loan documents  adherence to loan policy parameters  dealer performance  loan delinquencies and loan charge offs 
summary reports are submitted to the chief executive officer  the risk management officer and the board of directors on a monthly basis

the manner in which the allowance is established is based on judgments  assumptions and estimates that are difficult  complex and subjective 
use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our operating results or financial condition 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
the following table sets forth activity in the company s allowance for loan losses for the years presented in the table

during the past five years  mortgage loan and commercial loan charge offs excluding eastern loans were  and  respectively 
while we believe this favorable experience is attributable to our adhering to conservative underwriting policies  it is also due to the generally strong economy that existed during most of that time 
such favorable experience may not be sustainable over normal lending cycles 
when the economy is strong  an inherent higher level of risk continues to exist because of the long term nature of our mortgage and commercial loan portfolios 
mortgage loans tend to have an average life of several years 
the higher level of risk in such loans becomes more evident when the economy weakens 

table of contents the following tables set forth the company s percent of allowance by loan category and the percent of loans to total loans excluding deferred loan origination costs in each of the categories listed at the dates indicated

in determining the level of the allowance  management evaluates specific credits and the portfolio in general using several methods that include historical performance  collateral values  cash flows and current economic conditions 
this evaluation culminates with a judgment on the probability of collection of loans outstanding 
the company utilizes an internal rating system as one of its methods to monitor and evaluate credit risk 
at the time of approval  all loans other than auto loans  one to four family residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and other consumer loans are assigned a rating based on all the factors considered in originating the loan 
the initial loan rating is recommended by the loan officer and approved by the individuals or committee responsible for approving the loan 
loan officers are expected to recommend to the loan committee changes in loan ratings when facts come to their attention that warrant an upgrade or downgrade in a loan rating 
problem and potential problem assets including those in the eastern loan portfolio are assigned ratings that coincide with the substandard  doubtful and loss classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions 
generally  an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and or the collateral pledged 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve and or charge off is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are 
table of contents designated special mention 
the company assigns its fourth lowest rating to loans meeting this designation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews with the watch committee the status of each loan assigned one of the company s four adverse internal ratings and the judgments made in determining the valuation allowances allocated to such loans 
loans  or portions of loans  classified loss are either charged off against valuation allowances or a specific allowance is established in an amount equal to the amount classified loss 
at december   there were loans of million classified special mention  million classified substandard and million classified doubtful 
there were specific reserves of  on such loans 
at december   there were loans of million classified special mention  million classified substandard and million classified doubtful 
there were specific reserves of  on such loans 
the decrease in loans classified special mention was due primarily to loan payments 
the increase in loans classified substandard was due primarily to the addition of a  construction loan  a  multi family mortgage loan and  in home equity loans 
see the subsection loans construction and development loans for information about the loan 
deteriorating local economic conditions has caused some of our borrowers to experience difficulty in meeting their loan obligations 
the reserves established on classified loans at december  are considered reasonable estimates of the loss exposure associated with those loans at that date 
continued deterioration in the economy  however  could result in the need for additional reserves and an increase in the future level of non performing loans 
the unallocated part of the allowance is based on an evaluation of factors such as real estate values in the areas where we lend money  concentrations in the amount of loans we have outstanding to large borrowers and trends in the economy that affect real estate values  the consumer  the auto industry and the business sectors in which the company makes loans 
determination of this portion of the allowance is a very subjective process 
management believes the unallocated allowance is an important component of the total allowance because it addresses the probable inherent risk of loss that exists in that part of the company s loan portfolio with repayment terms extended over many years 
it also helps to minimize the risk related to the margin of imprecision inherent with the estimation of the allocated components of the allowance 
we have not allocated the unallocated portion of the allowance to the major categories of loans because such an allocation would imply a degree of precision that does not exist 
as reported in prior years  based upon a review of reserve factors assigned to the various loan categories  we decided to reduce the reserve factor applied to the balance of multi family mortgage loans 
the change in the reserve factor resulted in an  reduction in the allowance for loan losses that was credited to earnings in prior to december   the allowance for loan losses included amounts for unfunded credit commitments 
such amounts were determined by multiplying the reserve factors assigned to each loan segment times the balance of unfunded commitments by loan segment 
effective december   the allowance related to unfunded credit commitments of  was transferred from the allowance for loan losses to a separate liability account 
this change  which was made to comply with the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles  had no effect on the consolidated earnings of the company 
this accounting treatment was not followed prior to that date due to immateriality 
the amount transferred would have been  at the end of

if this amount had been excluded from the allowance for loan losses  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans would have been at december  loans are placed on non accrual status either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest and principal or generally when a loan becomes past due days 
restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions such as reductions of interest rates to below market terms and or extension of repayment terms were granted due to a borrower s financial condition 
at december  and  loans past due days or more and still on accrual amounted to  and  respectively 
the loans were comprised primarily of multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans calling for regular principal and interest payments at amounts that would result in the full payment of the loans over twenty to twenty five years even though the maturity date of the loans was set to occur earlier 
after the maturity date  the borrowers continued to make their regular principal and interest payments as if their loans had been renewed when  if fact  the renewals had not yet taken place 
through mid february  loan renewals have been executed with borrowers representing  of the total loans past due days or more at december  we expect to have all of the remaining loans either renewed or paid in full 
no loss is expected from these loans 
non performing assets include other real estate owned resulting from foreclosures of properties securing mortgage loans or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  repossessed vehicles resulting from non payment of amounts due under auto loans and repossessed equipment resulting from non payment of amounts due under eastern loans 
other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles and equipment are recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell 
non accrual loans at december  included five one to four family mortgage loans  four home equity loans  one multi family mortgage loan and two commercial real estate loans to one borrower 
except for the commercial real estate loans  the other loans were generally adequately secured by the estimated values of the underlying properties 
any potential loss exposure should repossession and disposition of the underlying properties become necessary is not expected to be significant and has been recognized through the establishment of reserves included in the allowance for loan losses 
disposition of the commercial real estate loans has been slow due to a protracted legal process and  as a result  in  was charged off and an additional reserve of  was established for the potential loss exposure 
eastern and auto loans on non accrual are comprised of several loans 
see the subsections provision for credit losses auto loans and eastern loans appearing elsewhere herein for information about delinquencies and net charge offs in the 
table of contents eastern and auto loan portfolios 
other real estate owned at december  was comprised of two residential properties resulting from foreclosure 
one of the properties was sold in without a loss 
at the time of acquisition of the other property  the balances of the related loan exceeded the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell by  and  accordingly  that amount was charged to the allowance for loan losses 
a loss of  was charged to earnings upon the ultimate sale of the property in the decline in repossessed vehicles in and was due primarily to improvements in the quality of the auto loan portfolio resulting from application of stricter underwriting criteria commencing in the second half of the increase in repossessed vehicles in was attributable to an increase in borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments and weaker demand for repossessed vehicles at dealer auctions 
the increase in repossessed vehicles during through was due primarily to growth of the auto loan portfolio during that time 
the increases in repossessed equipment in and were attributable to a rise in the number of eastern borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments 
the decline in repossessed equipment in resulted from more aggressive collection efforts 
at december   restructured loans included  of eastern loans and  of one to four family mortgage loans  at december  and  restructured loans were comprised entirely of eastern loans 
restructured loans are loans where the maturity date was extended and or interest rates were reduced to drop required monthly payments to more manageable amounts for the borrowers 
the other receivable amounting to  at december  was collected in full subsequent to that date 
deposits historically  deposits have been the company s primary source of funds 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposit accounts consist of non interest bearing checking accounts and interest bearing now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts referred to in the aggregate as transaction deposit accounts and certificate of deposit accounts 
the company offers individual retirement accounts iras and other qualified plan accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market rates  prevailing interest rates and the relative attractiveness of competing deposit and investment alternatives 
deposits are obtained predominantly from customers in the communities in which our banking offices are located 
deposits are also gathered via the internet 
the company relies primarily on competitive pricing of its deposit products  customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the company s ability to attract and retain deposits 
the following table presents the deposit activity excluding brokered deposits of the company for the years indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net deposits interest credited on deposit accounts total increase in deposit accounts in  transaction deposit accounts decreased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits increased million  or 
intense competition for deposits throughout resulted in the offering of elevated interest rates  especially for certificates of deposit 
in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits decreased million  or 
in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits increased million  or 
we believe the growth in deposits and the shift in the mix of deposits in and were due to the desire of depositors to place their funds in a stronger capitalized financial institution and in more liquid accounts 
a rise in interest rates could cause a shift from transaction deposit accounts to certificates of deposit accounts with longer maturities 
generally  the rates paid on certificates of deposit are higher than those paid on transaction deposit accounts 

table of contents the company obtained million of brokered certificates of deposit in and used the funds primarily to pay off some of the higher rate borrowed funds of eastern that were outstanding at the time of our acquisition of a controlling interest in eastern 
the brokered deposits were paid off as they matured in through the deposits were not rolled over because the rates offered on new brokered deposits were higher than rates available on alternative funding sources 
there were no brokered deposits at december  the following table sets forth the distribution of the average balances of the company s deposit accounts for the years indicated and the weighted average interest rates on each category of deposits presented

table of contents at december   the company had outstanding million in certificates of deposit of  or more  maturing as follows maturity period amount weighted average rate dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through months over months borrowed funds the company utilizes advances from the fhlb to fund part of its loan growth and in connection with its management of the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
the advances are secured by a blanket security agreement which requires the bank to maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets  principally mortgage loans and securities in an aggregate amount at least equal to outstanding advances 
the maximum amount that the fhlb will advance to member institutions  including the company  fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb 
at december   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb and had the capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlb 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding borrowed funds for the dates indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands advances from the fhlb average balance outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end during the year balance outstanding at end of year weighted average interest rate during the year weighted average interest rate at end of year stockholders equity  dividends and capital resources stockholders equity declined from million at the end of to million at the end of and million at the end of the reductions were due primarily to the payment to stockholders of two extra dividends of per share each in and one extra dividend of per share in payment of the extra dividends mentioned above exceeded earnings and  accordingly represented a return of capital to stockholders subject to taxation rather than a distribution of earnings 
the total of extra dividends paid between august the date of the first extra payment and february the date of the last extra payment  amounted to over million  or per share 
such payments were an effective means of distributing part of the company s excess capital in a measured way that treated all stockholders equally 
the board of directors discontinued payment of an extra dividend after the payment made in february because it concluded that stockholders would be better served by preservation of capital to support growth of the company and to take advantage of opportunities that might arise 
at december   brookline bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
brookline s tier i capital was million  or of adjusted assets

the effect of such activity on the company s financial condition and results of operations are immaterial 
contractual obligations a summary of contractual obligations at december  by the expected payment period follows 
payment due by period less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands borrowed funds from the fhlb loan commitments occupancy lease commitments service provider contracts retirement benefit obligations these amounts represent commitments made by the company to extend credit to borrowers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the leases contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes and other expenditures 
payments to service providers under most of the existing contracts are based on the volume of accounts served or transactions processed 
some contracts also call for higher required payments when there are increases in the consumer price index 
the expected payments shown in this table are based on an estimate of the number of accounts to be served or transactions to be processed  but do not include any projection of the effect of changes in the consumer price index 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and debt securities and borrowings from the fhlb 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage loan prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rate trends  economic conditions and competition 
based on its monitoring of historic deposit trends and its current pricing strategy for deposits  management believes the company will retain a large portion of its existing deposit base 
while deposits excluding brokered deposits grew significantly in million or  growth in will depend on several factors  including the strength of the economy  the interest rate environment and competitor pricing 
the company utilizes advances from the fhlb to fund growth and to manage part of the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
generally  borrowings from the fhlb result in more interest expense than would be incurred if growth was funded solely by deposits 
advances outstanding from the fhlb decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of as the company used part of its deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of mortgage 
table of contents backed securities to pay off borrowings 
the million increase in advances in was used primarily to fund much of the loan growth in that year 
at december   the company had the capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlb 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities that generally mature within days 
at december   such assets amounted to million  or of total assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates 
since net interest income is the company s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
the company s asset liability committee  comprised of several members of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee reviews with the board of directors on a quarterly basis its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  the company s interest rate risk position and the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the company s future net interest income 
the committee is involved in the planning process as well as in the monitoring of pricing for the company s loan and deposit products 
the committee manages interest rate risk through use of both earnings simulation and gap analysis 
earnings simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments and deposit flows 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management s assumptions base case is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward or downward in the first year of the model interest rate shock 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income over a one year period under scenarios of a basis points change upward or downward as a percentage of base case earnings projections 
changes in interest rates basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year base case over one year the company s interest rate risk policy states that an immediate basis points change upward or downward should not negatively impact estimated net interest income over a one year period by more than 
the results shown above are based on the assumption that there are no significant changes in the company s operating environment and that short term interest rates will remain at current levels for all of further  in the case of the basis points downward adjustment  it was assumed that it would not be possible to reduce the rates paid on certain deposit accounts by basis points 
instead  it was assumed that now accounts would be reduced by basis points and savings accounts by basis points 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions used will be validated in gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
an asset sensitive position indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time horizons  which would generally imply a favorable impact on net interest income in periods of rising interest rates and a negative impact in periods of falling rates 
a liability sensitive position would generally imply a negative impact on net interest income in periods of rising rates and a positive impact in periods of falling rates 
gap analysis has limitations because it cannot measure the effect of interest rate movements and competitive pressures on the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
generally  it is the company s policy to reasonably match the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period 

table of contents the table below shows the company s interest rate sensitivity gap position as of december  one year or less more than one year to two years more than two years to three years more than three years to four years more than four years to five years more than five years to ten years more than ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments weighted average rate debt securities weighted average rate mortgage loans weighted average rate commercial loans eastern weighted average rate indirect automobile loans weighted average rate other loans weighted average rate total interest earning assets weighted average rate interest bearing liabilities now accounts weighted average rate savings accounts weighted average rate money market savings accounts weighted average rate certificates of deposit weighted average rate borrowed funds weighted average rate total interest bearing liabilities weighted average rate interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
debt securities include all debt securities 
unrealized gains and losses on securities  all other marketable equity securities and restricted equity securities are excluded 
for purposes of the gap analysis  the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan fees and costs on loans and fair value adjustments are excluded 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates paid on now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts are subject to change at any time and such deposits are immediately withdrawable 
a review of rates paid on these deposit categories over the last several years indicated that the amount and timing of rate changes did not coincide with the amount and timing of rate changes on other deposits when the federal reserve adjusted its benchmark federal funds rate 
because of this lack of correlation and the unlikelihood that such deposits would be withdrawn immediately  the company allocates money market savings accounts between the one year or less and the more than one year to two years columns and now accounts and savings accounts equally over those two columns and the more than two years to three years column in its gap position table 
at december   interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion  resulting in a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
at december   the company had a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
the change in the cumulative one year gap position from the end of resulted primarily from the shifting of a portion of certificates of deposit to money market savings accounts 

table of contents the company s cumulative positive interest sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities with expected maturities of more than three years changed from approximately million  or  of total assets at december  to million  or  of total assets at december  other market risks 
included in the company s investment portfolio at december  were marketable equity securities with a market value of million 
that amount includes net unrealized gains of  and unrealized losses of  movements in the market price of securities may affect the amount of gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from the sale of its equity securities
