item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
overview we have developed what we believe to be the first and only commercially available intelligent robotic radiosurgery system  the cyberknife system  designed to treat solid tumors anywhere in the body as an alternative to traditional surgery 
the cyberknife system combines continuous image guidance technology with a compact linear accelerator that has the ability to move in three dimensions according to the treatment plan 
our image guidance technology enables the system to continuously acquire images to track a tumor s location and transmit any position corrections to the robotic arm prior to delivery of each dose of radiation 
our compact linear accelerator linac is a compact radiation treatment device that uses microwaves to accelerate electrons to create high energy x ray beams to destroy the tumor 
this combination  which we refer to as intelligent robotics  extends the benefits of radiosurgery to the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body 
the cyberknife system autonomously tracks  detects and corrects for tumor and patient movement in real time during the procedure  enabling delivery of precise  high dose radiation typically with sub millimeter accuracy 
the cyberknife procedure requires no anesthesia  can be performed on an outpatient basis and allows for the treatment of patients who otherwise would not have been treated with radiation or who may not have been good candidates for surgery 
in addition  the cyberknife procedure is designed to avoid many of the potential risks and complications that are associated with other treatment options and is more cost effective than traditional surgery 

table of contents in july  we obtained k clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the cyberknife system for the treatment of tumors and certain other conditions in the head  neck and upper spine 
in august  we received fda clearance for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated 
in september  we received a ce mark for the sale of the cyberknife system in europe 
ce mark is an international symbol that represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the european medical device directive 
we received approval for full body treatment in japan in june  previously our cyberknife regulatory approvals in japan were limited to treatment for indications in the head and neck 
the cyberknife system has also been approved for various indications in korea  taiwan  china and other countries 
to date  our cyberknife system has been used to deliver more than  patient treatments 
in the united states  we sell to customers  including hospitals and stand alone treatment facilities  directly through our sales organization 
outside the united states  we sell to customers in over countries directly and through distributors 
we have sales and service offices in paris  france  hong kong  china  tokyo  japan  madrid  spain  new delhi  india  singapore  moscow  russia  munich  germany  istanbul  turkey and london  uk 
as of june   we had employees in our sales organization 
our cyberknife systems are either sold to our customers or placed with our customers pursuant to our shared ownership program 
as of june   we had cyberknife systems installed at customer sites  including sold and three pursuant to our shared ownership program 
of the systems installed  are in the americas  are in asia and are in europe 
in addition to selling the cyberknife system to customers through direct sales  we offer alternative arrangements to customers who may not have the financial means to purchase a cyberknife system 
for example  under our shared ownership program  we retain title to the cyberknife system while the customer has use of the system 
our shared ownership contracts generally require a minimum monthly payment from the customer  and we may earn additional revenue through the use of the system at the site 
generally  minimum monthly payments are equivalent to the revenue generated from treating three to four patients per month  and any revenue received from additional patients is shared between us and the customer 
we expect to continue to offer our shared ownership program to new customers 
the shared ownership program typically has a term of five years  during which the customer has the option to purchase the system at pre determined prices 
we manufacture and assemble our cyberknife systems at our manufacturing facility in sunnyvale  california 
we purchase major components  including the robotic manipulator  the treatment table or robotic couch  the magnetron  which creates the microwaves for use in the linear accelerator  the imaging cameras and the computers  from outside suppliers  some of which are single source 
our reliance on single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner 
however  in most cases  if a supplier were unable to deliver these components  we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications  if required 
we would  however  likely suffer some delays as a result of qualifying any new supplier 
we manufacture certain other electronic and electrical subsystems  including the linear accelerator 
we then assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform testing prior to shipment to customer sites 
we generate revenue from sales of products and by providing ongoing services and upgrades to customers following installation of the cyberknife system 
the current united states price for the cyberknife system typically includes initial training  installation  and a one year warranty 
we also offer optional hardware and software when and if available  technical enhancements and upgrades to the cyberknife system  as part of our multiyear service plans 
currently  our most comprehensive service plan is our diamond elite multiyear service plan  or diamond plan 
under our diamond plan  
table of contents customers are eligible to receive up to two upgrades per year  when and if available 
prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered our platinum service plan which provided specified future upgrade obligations 
for systems sold with a platinum service plan  all revenue  including cyberknife product and service revenue  is deferred until all upgrade obligations have been satisfied and then is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the platinum service contract 
as of june  and  out of and out of of our customers that purchased service plans had purchased non platinum service plans 
the cyberknife procedure is currently covered and reimbursed by medicare and other governmental and non governmental third party payors 
medicare coverage currently exists in the hospital outpatient setting and in the freestanding clinic setting 
for calendar year  the national unadjusted average medicare payment rates under healthcare common procedure coding system  or hcpcs  are  under code g  the billing code for the first treatment  and  under code g  the billing code for each of the second through fifth treatments 
payment for the freestanding clinic setting is governed by the final medicare physician fee schedule 
for  payment for cyberknife procedures in the freestanding clinic settings for first and subsequent treatments is set by local medicare carriers and rates may vary from low payment to a payment rate exceeding the hospital outpatient payment rates 
we will continue to evaluate the impact that the health care legislation bill  hr  and the effect the implementation of its statutes may have on medicare reimbursement rates 
in late june and early july of medicare published its proposed rules for hospital outpatient services  for physicians  and services performed in the freestanding center setting 
after a day comment period medicare will review and analyze the comments 
once medicare s analysis is complete the final rules will be published  which we anticipate to occur near the end of october the proposed rates in the hospital outpatient setting reflect a decrease for g and a increase for g proposed payment in the freestanding clinic setting for the first and subsequent treatments continues to be set by local medicare carriers and rates may vary from low payment to a payment rate exceeding the hospital outpatient payment rates 
in addition to medicare reimbursement to hospitals and clinics  physicians receive reimbursement for their professional services in the hospital outpatient setting and the freestanding clinic setting 
payment to physicians is based on the medicare physician fee schedule  and payment amounts are updated on an annual basis 
for  medicare adjusted reimbursement rates for the current procedural terminology  or cpt  code series describing the surgeon s role in the delivery of cyberknife cranial and spinal procedures beginning with and to varying degrees 
for example  the rate for treating five simple cranial lesions was reduced by less than one percent  and the rate for treating one complex cranial lesion was increased by more than 
for medicare has proposed adjustments to reimbursement rates for the cpt code series describing the surgeon s role in the delivery of cyberknife cranial and spinal procedures beginning with and to varying degrees 
these adjustments vary from a increase to a increase 
radiosurgery procedures in other anatomies require other surgeons to bill unlisted cpt codes with no assigned payment rates 
payment rates for unlisted codes are set by the local medicare carrier and rates may vary from no payment to rates equivalent to the comparable cpt rates for the series beginning with and coding for other physicians primarily radiation oncologists involved in the delivery of cyberknife treatment increased by one percent 
medicare did not propose changes for to payment rates in other anatomies not described by the cranial and spinal procedure codes 
in november of  we announced the introduction of the cyberknife vsi system  which allows physicians to perform conventionally fractioned robotic image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy  or robotic imrt  in addition to robotic stereotactic radiosurgery procedures 
reimbursement for robotic imrt is expected to be similar to conventional imrt 
medicare 
table of contents proposed physician fee schedule rules reflect an increase in for the treatment delivery code used to report imrt services delivered by the cyberknife vsi system 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and increase our position in the market 
to compete successfully  we will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over alternative procedures  products and technologies  and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of our products and technologies 
our business and sales and installation cycle does not immediately create recognizable revenue 
as such  we must invest in sales and marketing activities generally to years before we are able to generate revenue from those activities 
our ability to achieve and maintain long term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell the cyberknife system and to control our costs and effectively manage our growth 
financial operations sales and installation cycle the cyberknife system has a long sales and installation cycle because it is a major capital purchase for our typical customer and requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
the sales and installation cycle is typically to years in duration and involves multiple steps 
the cycle begins with customer meetings with sales and products specialists  and ends upon resolution of all contingencies and either upon shipment  if a customer is responsible for installation  or upon installation by us 
prior to installation  a purchasing institution must typically obtain a radiation device installation permit  and in some cases  a certificate of need or con  both of which must be granted by state and local government bodies and can add time to the cycle 
recently  as a result of healthcare cost considerations and sensitivity to the cost of major capital equipment items  some state con boards have become more stringent in the evaluation of con applications 
this trend  if it continues  may make the con process more protracted and uncertain 
in addition  the purchasing institution must build a radiation shielded facility or upgrade an existing facility to house the cyberknife system 
we generally receive a deposit at the time the purchase agreement is entered into  or shortly thereafter  an additional payment prior to shipment and the remaining balance for the sale of the cyberknife system after delivery and installation 
the customer also typically selects a service plan at the time of signing a cyberknife system purchase agreement and enters into the service plan agreement prior to installation of the system 
upon installation  we typically recognize the cyberknife system sale price less the fair value of at least one year of service and training 
we recognize the fair value of the first year of service as revenue pro rata over the twelve months following installation and training as delivered 
in addition  if the customer has purchased our diamond or emerald service plan and assuming annual renewals  we would receive payment at the beginning of each of the second  third  fourth and fifth years of the multiyear service plan and recognize that revenue pro rata over each year 
legacy service plans prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered a platinum elite multiyear service plan  or platinum plan 
this legacy service plan was structured so that we have an obligation to deliver two upgrades per year over the course of the multiyear service plan 
if we fail to deliver the upgrades  our customers are entitled to receive a refund of up to  for each upgrade not offered 
to date  no refunds have been required pursuant to the platinum plan 
beginning in november  we phased out offering this legacy service plan to new customers 

table of contents the platinum plan obligates us to deliver up to two upgrades per year during the term of the contract 
we have not established fair value for those future obligations  hence  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires that we cannot begin to recognize any of the revenue derived from the sale of the cyberknife system or the associated service plan until all upgrade obligations have been fulfilled 
therefore  the payments made by our customers who have our legacy platinum plan are categorized as deferred revenue 
once we fulfill all upgrade obligations with respect to a specific platinum plan  we ratably recognize the revenue from the sale of the cyberknife system and the platinum plan over the remaining life of the contract 
as of the end of june we had installed the final upgrades on all systems sold under platinum agreements 
we anticipate that we will satisfy our final obligations under the remaining platinum service plans and recognize platinum service revenue of approximately million in fiscal customers who purchased platinum plans may purchase additional upgrades as optional extras prior to the delivery of all originally specified upgrade obligations 
such additional upgrades are considered elements of the original arrangement and associated revenues are deferred until the earlier of delivery of all elements upgrade obligations  or establishment of vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for all undelivered elements 
sales of additional upgrades after delivery of all specified upgrade obligations  as stated in the original contract  are considered separate arrangements and are recognized once all revenue recognition criteria applicable to the separate arrangements are met 
as of june  we had fulfilled all upgrade obligations with respect to the sale of systems in connection with platinum plans 
warranty all customers purchasing a cyberknife system receive up to a two year warranty 
in circumstances where we have vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements  we recognize the cyberknife system purchase price minus the fair value of support services upon installation  if we are responsible for providing installation  or delivery  and we recognize the value of the support ratably over the corresponding period following installation 
shared ownership program revenue we recognize revenue monthly from our shared ownership program that consists of a minimum monthly payment 
we also recognize usage based revenue in excess of the monthly minimum based on usage reports from our customers 
we recognized revenue from our shared ownership program of million  million and million for the years ended june   and the decrease in shared ownership revenue from june  compared to june  and is due to the buyout of a large portion of the placement units throughout the previous fiscal years 
in limited cases  we received nonrefundable upfront payments from shared ownership program customers which are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the contract 
the cyberknife system shared ownership systems are recorded within property and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated life of seven years 
depreciation and warranty expense attributable to shared ownership systems are recorded within cost of shared ownership program as they are incurred 
international sales revenue we sell our products internationally through a combination of direct sales force and a network of distributors 
we have strategically developed distributor relationships to serve our customers 
many of our distributors are responsible for installation and service support 

table of contents for international sales  we recognize revenue once we have met all of our obligations associated with the purchase agreement  other than for undelivered service elements for which we have vsoe of fair value 
in situations where we are directly responsible for installation  we recognize revenue once we have installed the cyberknife system and have confirmed performance against specification 
for sales through distributors  we recognize revenue upon shipment provided we have received proof of sell through to the end user from the distributor and assuming all of our remaining obligations have been satisfied 
net revenue from international customers was million  million and million for the years ended june   and we believe the increase in international sales for the year ended june  is due to a number of factors  including the following increased focus on international markets through regionalization  different impact of the economic downturn by country  greater significance of government affiliated hospital customers  and growth in select country markets 
backlog backlog consists of the sum of deferred revenue  future un invoiced payments that our customers are contractually committed to make  signed  non contingent cyberknife system sale agreements that meet the detailed criteria set forth below  service plans and minimum payment requirements associated with our shared ownership program 
in previous fiscal years  we reported both contingent and non contingent cyberknife system sale agreements as backlog  however  as previously disclosed  we refined our definition of backlog in fiscal year to enhance the usefulness of this information in analyzing and building models of our business 
beginning july   in order for a cyberknife system sale agreement to be counted as backlog under the refined definition  it must meet the following criteria the contract is signed and properly executed by both the customer and accuray  the contract is non contingent it either has cleared all its contingencies or contains no contingencies when signed  accuray has received a deposit or a letter of credit  or the sale is a direct channel sale to a government entity  the specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment  and less than years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above 
included in customers agreements to purchase a cyberknife is an option to select the type and term of service coverage that they desire 
backlog includes the value of this service coverage selected by customers in their original agreement to purchase a cyberknife system 
before installation of the cyberknife is complete and service commences the customer must complete and sign a separate service agreement for service coverage ie diamond or emerald service 
if at the time of signing the service agreement a customer selects a different type of service than the option selected in the cyberknife system purchase agreement  our backlog is adjusted to reflect the service agreement the customer signed 
at june   our backlog under our refined definition was approximately million 
of total backlog under the refined definition  million represented cyberknife system sales at june   and million represented revenue from service plans and other recurring revenues at june  we anticipate that this backlog will be recognized over the next five years as installations occur  upgrades are delivered and services are provided 
we have not provided comparisons of our backlog in fiscal to our backlog from fiscal given the change in our backlog definition from fiscal to fiscal  such comparisons would not be meaningful  as the definitions of backlog were based on different criteria 

table of contents although our backlog includes only contractual agreements from our customers  we cannot make assurances that we will convert it into recognized revenue due to factors outside our control including without limitation  changes in customers needs  changes in reimbursement  changes to regulatory requirements  or other cancellation of orders 
results of operations overview our results of operations are divided into the following components net revenue 
our net revenue consists primarily of product revenue revenue derived primarily from the sale of cyberknife systems and the sale of linacs for other uses  shared ownership program revenue revenue generated from our shared ownership program  services revenue revenue generated from sales of post contract support service plans  installation and training and other revenue revenue from specialized upgrade services for units previously sold in japan  other specialized services and other non medical products 
deferred revenue platinum multiyear service plans 
we are required to defer all of the revenue associated with our legacy multiyear service plans  including our platinum plan  until we have satisfied all of the specified obligations related to the delivery of upgrades to the cyberknife system during the life of the service plan 
this includes deferring revenue for the cash received for the purchase of the cyberknife system and multiyear service plans until we have delivered all upgrades which the customer is eligible to receive 
once we have satisfied our obligations for delivery of upgrades under the plan  we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining life of the service plan 
we have not offered the platinum service plan to new customers since we phased it out when we introduced our diamond plan in november prior to fiscal we had installed the final upgrades and recognized all revenue on systems sold under gold agreements 
as of the end of june we had installed the final upgrades on all systems sold under platinum agreements 
we recognized approximately million of revenue related to these platinum agreements in fiscal we anticipate that we will satisfy our final obligations under the remaining platinum service plans and recognize platinum service revenue of approximately million in fiscal cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
in future periods  we expect cost of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on system configurations ordered by our customers and overall revenue mix 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for personnel and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia  and advertising and promotional activities 
we expect marketing expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of major marketing events  such as significant trade shows 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of activities associated with our product development  regulatory and clinical study arrangements 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  in house legal  and human resources  and external expenses related to accounting  legal and other consulting fees 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments  unrealized losses on our long term trading securities  net of unrealized gains on our put option  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  losses on fixed asset disposals  and state and local sales and use tax fines and penalties

by comparison  during fiscal  we recognized product revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and two units purchased out of our shared ownership program 
the increase in fiscal is due primarily to the remaining deferred revenue for units sold in prior periods recognized in fiscal year in accordance with our revenue recognition policy and an increase in upgrades and accessories sold 
excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized non platinum service revenue of million for the year ended june   which increased approximately million from the year ended june   due to the continued growth in our installed base under service plans 
as of june  and  out of and out of of our customers that had purchased service plans  respectively  had purchased non platinum service plans 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for product revenue and million for service revenue 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for product revenue and million for service revenue 
by the end of june we had satisfied all upgrade delivery obligations on the units sold under our platinum plan 
once all upgrade delivery obligations have been satisfied  revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the contract service term 
shared ownership program revenue for the year ended june  decreased approximately million from the year ended june   primarily due to the sale of one cyberknife system at the end of fiscal year that had been in our shared ownership program 
we anticipate revenue from our shared ownership program will increase slightly in future periods due to the installation of one new shared ownership system in fiscal year revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june   decreased approximately million from the year ended june  due to a decrease in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan 
total net revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  during the year ended june   cyberknife systems were installed  of which were sold and one was attributable to our shared ownership program  compared to systems installed  
table of contents including units sold and four attributable to our shared ownership program during the year ended june  excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized million of product revenue in fiscal  associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and two units purchased out of our shared ownership program 
by comparison  during fiscal  we recognized product revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and units purchased out of our shared ownership program 
the decrease in fiscal is due primarily to the sale in fiscal of twelve cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program for an aggregate purchase price of million offset partially by the increase from to units sold not related to our shared ownership program 
excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized non platinum service revenue of million for the year ended june   which increased approximately million from the year ended june   due to the continued growth in our installed base under service plans

gross profit years ended june  dollars in thousands gross margin dollars in thousands gross margin dollars in thousands gross margin gross profit products shared ownership program services other gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended june  decreased from the year ended june  this decrease is due to a change in the mix of revenue sources as well as changes in the gross profit margin for these revenue sources 
services revenue  with a gross profit margin lower than for product revenue  increased as a percentage of total net revenues due to the continued installation of new systems and a decline in product revenues 
in addition product margins declined due to a number of factors including a trend towards higher functionality configurations which carry higher costs 
the increase in service revenue margins was attributable to a greater number of systems on a service contract and lower replacement parts consumption over the prior year 
shared 
table of contents ownership program revenue as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended june  decreased primarily due to the sale of units in the shared ownership program and reduction in residual revenue from the units sold in prior years 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended june  decreased slightly from the year ended june  this decrease is attributable to an increase in services revenue as a percentage of total net revenues  which have higher costs of revenue as compared to product revenue and decrease in shared ownership revenue as a percentage of total net revenues  which have lower costs of revenue as compared to product revenue 
the increase in service revenue margins was attributable mainly to an increase in platinum service margins due to high margins on five platinum systems that were fully recognized during the year ended june   in accordance with the final upgrades being installed at these sites during the final period of the service contract term  compared to one site that was fully recognized during the year ended june  shared ownership program revenue as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended june  decreased primarily due to the sale of two cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program during the year ended june  compared to the sale of cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program during the year ended june  selling and marketing expenses years ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing of net revenue selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  decreased million from the year ended june  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation as we reduced headcount in selling and marketing by approximately year over year

further  bad debt expense decreased  year over year primarily due to resolution of prior year reserves 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by a million increase in consulting services primarily associated with increased legal and tax fees driven mainly by the strategic alliance negotiations with siemens and the shareholder lawsuit 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in severance benefits due to employee separation costs and costs recorded under the plan  an increase of  in outside consulting services related mainly to expenses recorded for morphormics  inc  or morphormics  our variable interest entity which we are required to consolidate in our financial results subsequent to the acquisition in july  an increase of  in legal fees and accounting  audit and tax fees mainly as a result of the investigation of the handling and accounting for certain inventory items conducted during the year ended june   and an increase of  in bad debt expense

interest income was offset by million in foreign currency transaction loss resulting from the decline in the euro s international conversion rate 

table of contents other income  net for the year ended june  decreased million from the year ended june  primarily due to a decrease of million in interest income due to a decrease in both the average daily balances kept in interest bearing accounts and the interest rates earned on amounts kept in those accounts during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and net unrealized losses of  related to the change in fair value of our trading securities 
provision for income taxes years ended june  dollars in thousands provision for income taxes of net revenue the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  decreased  from the year ended june   resulting in a  net benefit 
in fiscal  we recorded an increase in foreign taxes of  as compared to the prior year as the result of changes in our jurisdictional mix of income 
we also recorded a decrease in federal and state taxes of  as compared to the prior year due to benefits we recognized as the result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which permits some relief from federal alternative minimum tax 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset against future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts and will begin to expire in for federal and for state purposes  respectively 
such net operating loss carryforwards include tax benefits from employee option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expense that has been recognized for those awards in accordance with asc we will record approximately million as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when such excess benefits are ultimately realized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  while the state tax credits have no expiration date 
in addition  among other matters  realization of the entire deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
due to the inconsistent history of net operating income as adjusted for permanent differences  we cannot conclude that the net domestic deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets 
at june   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us if repatriated  these earnings could result in a tax expense at the current us federal statutory tax rate of  subject to available net operating losses and other factors 
subject to limitation  tax on undistributed earnings may also be reduced by foreign tax credits that may be generated in connection with the repatriation of earnings 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for the years ended june   and such that expense was recorded only for those stock based awards that are expected to vest 
for the years ended june   and we recorded million  million and million respectively  of stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for stock options  employee stock purchase plan  or espp  shares issued and rsus granted to employees 

table of contents as of june   there was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  espp options and restricted stock units which we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
as we have exercised our put option with ubs  we no longer have an outstanding line of credit 
no other borrowings were outstanding as of june  we believe that we have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to continue in operation for at least the next months 
years ended june   and cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net income of million during fiscal year was offset by a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the recognition of revenue previously deferred for systems sold under our platinum plan offset partially by differences between invoicing customers for products and services and the recognition of the invoicing as revenue 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due to an insurance receivable amount recorded for insurance claims 
accounts payable decreased as a result of the timing of the receipt of invoices and when payment was made

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following revenue generated by sales of the cyberknife system  our shared ownership program and service plans  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  facilities  equipment and it systems required to support current and future operations  
table of contents rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of the cyberknife system  effects of competing technological and market developments  and number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions
