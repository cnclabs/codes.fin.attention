item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and resources 
such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under item a 
risk factors of this report 
executive overview as progressed  oil prices recovered gradually from levels under per barrel at the beginning of the year to over per barrel by year end 
the large drop in oil demand in that resulted from the global economic recession  together with increased production capacity in spite of significant delays in new development projects  led to spare oil production capacity reaching its highest level in nearly two decades 
however  the decisions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec at the end of to cut production  the adherence of the majority of opec countries to production quotas  and the improving economic outlook contributed to rising prices with stabilization at current levels 
during  the demand forecasts of the major energy organizations evolved with economic projections falling to a low of nearly million barrels of oil per day bopd in may  then increasing gradually by million bopd toward the end of the year 
the final forecast figure of million bopd represented the second consecutive year on year drop in oil demand for the first time in years 
for  economic projections for world real gdp growth are converging towards a median estimate of  but with a significant level of uncertainty 
a large gap exists between gdp growth rates of organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and non oecd countries particularly in china and in other developing asian economies 
overall oecd country demand will remain at its lowest level in over a decade  but this will be compensated by growth in china  south east asia and the middle east 
from a supply standpoint  the level of uncertainty in oil demand and oil prices led e p customers to cut investment in particularly in projects with the highest production costs but forecasts published at the end of the year indicated a likely rise in investment in the natural gas markets behaved differently from oil markets in the combination of the drop in gas demand that resulted from reduced industrial activity  the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america  and the commissioning of a number of new large lng liquefied natural gas exporting facilities around the world contributed to an over supplied market with consequent pressure on spot gas prices 
on a per british thermal unit basis  the ratio of oil to henry hub gas prices increased to its highest level in the last four decades  threatening the linkage mechanisms in future long term supply contracts 
within the united states  the world s largest natural gas market  and despite some fuel switching in power generation from coal to gas and lower canadian gas imports  natural gas storage levels have been significantly above the five year range consistently since april consequently  natural gas wellhead prices have reached their lowest levels since this has translated into the largest sustained drop in gas related drilling and service activity since the period 
nevertheless  the technological success associated with production from unconventional gas reservoirs in the united states is leading to an increasing level of interest in similar formations outside north america  particularly in europe  which could lead to an expansion in activity when natural gas prices rebound 
within this market  schlumberger oilfield services full year revenue in declined versus  falling to billion 
lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals led to a decline in north america revenue  primarily in the us land and canada geomarkets 
europe cis africa revenue fell mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and reduced activity in the russia  north sea  west south africa and caspian geomarkets as well as at framo engineering 
this decline however was partially offset by increased activity in the north africa geomarket 
middle east asia revenue dropped primarily due to decreases in the east asia  east mediterranean  arabian and australia papua new guinea geomarkets 
latin america revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of 
table of contents part ii  item local currencies against the us dollar and much lower activity in venezuela trinidad tobago and peru colombia ecuador was nearly offset by stronger activity in mexico central america and brazil 
weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced revenue by approximately 
across the areas  all of the technologies recorded revenue declines except testing services 
ipm recorded revenue growth compared to while customers spent less on new technology in versus the previous year  a number of recently introduced schlumberger services made further market progress 
powerdrive family rotary steerable drilling systems extended their market reach  entering new markets in the north and latin america 
scanner family services for advanced formation evaluation saw success in mexico and canada  and well services recorded market penetration in saudi arabia  abu dhabi and malaysia with the range of active real time coiled tubing services that improve operating efficiency and well performance through the innovative use of fiber optic cable to convey downhole information to the surface 
investment in oilfield services infrastructure continued throughout the year 
significant events included the opening of a new reservoir completions manufacturing center in damman  saudi arabia 
representing an investment of million  the center houses a team of design and manufacturing engineers specialized in the production of downhole reservoir completions equipment 
the center also provides a collaborative environment in which joint oil company and schlumberger teams can develop and manufacture completions solutions for application across saudi arabia and the middle east 
in brazil  we announced the signing of a joint cooperation agreement with the universidade federal do rio de janeiro to build a key international research center on the university s campus 
this new center will focus on research and development activities in the deepwater subsalt environment  with emphasis on the development of geosciences software for the exploration and production sector  new technologies to meet reservoir challenges in subsalt environments  and the creation of a geophysical processing and interpretation center of excellence covering time lapse seismic and combined electromagnetic and seismic measurements 
a number of technology agreements and acquisitions were completed during the year to enable future product development or improve geographical reach 
in may  schlumberger acquired techsia sa  a supplier of petrophysical software based in montpellier  france 
techsia will become the schlumberger petrophysics software center of excellence for the development of state of the art solutions for the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
in september  schlumberger and national oilwell varco announced the creation of a joint venture to provide high speed drill string telemetry systems to improve the efficiency and safety of oil and gas operations 
the venture is expected to accelerate development and delivery of intelligent drilling solutions through the expanded use of the intelliserv broadband network  a patented technology that provides high resolution data in real time to and from the bottom of oil and gas wells as they are being drilled 
in november  schlumberger acquired lonkar services a company providing slickline  cased hole wireline and surface well testing services in western canada and northern usa 
also in november schlumberger signed a global cooperation agreement with technip to jointly develop subsea integrity and surveillance solutions for the flexible pipes used in deep offshore oil and gas production 
this agreement will initially focus on surveillance systems activities for new and challenging flexible pipe applications such as those required in the deepwater subsalt environment in brazil 
full year revenue of westerngeco was  at billion  lower than revenue decreased across all product lines  with the largest declines seen in marine and multiclient activity 
marine revenue fell on lower activity combined with reduced pricing as a result of weak market conditions 
multiclient revenue decreased primarily in north america  as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending 
land revenue fell on lower crew utilization  while data processing revenue decreased reflecting lower activity primarily in europe africa and in north america 
towards the end of the year  westerngeco announced the deployment of the next generation uniq integrated point receiver land seismic acquisition and processing system in kuwait for the kuwait oil company 
the new system  designed for greater operational efficiency and flexibility  offers up to four times 
table of contents part ii  item the capability of existing q land systems and is currently acquiring data from  live point receiver channels in conjunction with the westerngeco dx desert explorer with md sweep technology introduced the previous year 
the outlook for remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy 
at the end of the third quarter of  we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that demand for oil and gas would begin to increase 
consensus forecasts now predict that oil demand in will increase  particularly in the developing world  for the first time since as a result we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels and that as our customers confidence grows  their exploration and production budgets will increase 
we feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets  in russia  as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as iraq 
these events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages 
for natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious 
despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand as well as the recent cold weather  we consider that markets remain generally oversupplied 
increased lng flows together with further capacity being added in  as well as the general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production  have the potential to limit the current increase in the north american gas drilling rig count 
we anticipate that will be a better year for multiclient seismic  and for activity in land seismic particularly in middle east and north africa 
while marine activity is expected to be reasonably robust  pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions 
longer term we remain confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves and production of hydrocarbons to meet the world s needs 
our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment

table of contents part ii  item represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business 
although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
certain larger surveys  which are typically prefunded by customers  are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 

table of contents part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

table of contents part ii  item pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis  or upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s international pension plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans increased from in to in the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s international pension plans was increased from in to in a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was in both and the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was in and in a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december  was graded to over the next six years 
the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  for the united states and international pension plans stated in millions change in assumption effect on pretax pension expense effect on dec

schlumberger is in the process of evaluating what exchange rate will apply to schlumberger s local currency denominated transactions 
such rate is expected to be between and venezuelan bolivars fuertes per us dollar 
schlumberger does not expect the immediate impact of this devaluation to have a significant impact on its first quarter results of operations 
going forward  although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the us dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses  the impact will not be material to schlumberger s consolidated financial statements
