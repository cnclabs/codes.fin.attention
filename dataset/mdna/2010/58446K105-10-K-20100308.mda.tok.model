item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors in item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview we are the nation s seventh largest cable company based on the number of customers who purchase one or more video services  also known as basic subscribers 
we are among the leading cable operators focused on serving the smaller cities in the united states  such as des moines  iowa and springfield  missouri  with a significant customer concentration in the midwestern and southeastern regions 
we are the largest and second largest cable company in iowa and illinois  respectively 
approximately of our basic subscribers are in the top television markets in the united states  commonly referred to as nielsen media research designated market areas dmas  with more than in dmas that rank between the th and th largest 
through our interactive broadband network  we provide our customers with a wide variety of advanced products and services  including video services  such as video on demand  high definition television hdtv and digital video recorders dvrs  high speed data hsd and phone service 
we offer the triple play bundle of video  hsd and phone over a single communications platform  a significant advantage over most competitors in our service areas 
as of december   we offered our bundle of video  hsd and phone services to approximately of our estimated million homes passed in states 
as of the same date  we served approximately million basic subscribers   digital video customers   hsd customers and  phone customers  aggregating million revenue generating units rgus 
developments share exchange agreement on september   we entered into a share exchange agreement the exchange agreement with shivers investments  llc shivers and shivers trading operating company stoc 
both stoc and shivers are affiliates of morris communications company  llc morris communications 
stoc  shivers and morris communications are controlled by william s 
morris iii  who together with another morris communications representative  craig s 
mitchell  then held two seats on our board of directors 
on february   we completed the exchange agreement pursuant to which we exchanged of the shares of stock of a wholly owned subsidiary  which held approximately million of cash and non strategic cable systems serving approximately  basic subscribers the exchange systems for  shares of mediacom class a common stock held by shivers 
together with the basic subscribers  the exchange systems served  digital customers   hsd customers and  phone customers  or an aggregate  rgus 
effective upon closing of the transaction  messrs 
morris and mitchell resigned from our board of directors 
during the year ended december   the exchange systems recognized million of total revenues  million of service costs  million of selling  general and administrative expenses and million of depreciation and amortization  or million of operating income 
all comparisons to prior year results are on an actual basis  and instances where the inclusion of the exchange systems in the results of operations in the prior year had an offsetting impact are noted as the impact of the exchange agreement 
year over year comparisons of customer growth  revenues and expenses for the year ended december  are generally understated in the case of increases and overstated in the case of decreases  then would have occurred if the exchange agreement did not take place 
new financings on august   we entered into an incremental facility agreement that provides for a new term loan the new term loan under our existing credit facilities in the principal amount of million 
on the same date  we 
table of contents issued senior notes due august the notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and borrowings under the new term loan were an aggregate of million  after giving effect to original issue discount and financing costs 
the net proceeds were used to fund tender offers and redemptions of our existing senior notes due and senior notes due see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues  costs and expenses video revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable products and services including basic and digital cable programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation  reconnection and late payment fees  franchise fees and other ancillary revenues 
hsd revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers  including small to medium sized commercial establishments  for our hsd products and services and equipment rental fees  as well as fees charged to large sized businesses for our scalable  fiber based enterprise network products and services 
phone revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers  including small to medium sized commercial establishments  for our phone service 
advertising revenues represent the sale of advertising placed on our video services 
although we may continue to lose video customers as a result of greater competition and weak economic conditions  we believe we will grow video revenues for the foreseeable future through increased gains in penetration of our advanced video services as well as rate increases 
we expect further growth in hsd and phone revenues  as we believe we will continue to expand our penetration of our hsd and phone services 
however  future growth in hsd and phone customers may be adversely affected by intensifying competition  weakened economic conditions and  specific to phone  wireless substitution 
advertising revenues may stabilize in  given the potential for an economic recovery and the upcoming national election 
service costs consist primarily of video programming costs and other direct costs related to providing and maintaining services to our customers 
significant service costs include programming expenses  wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network  perform customer installation activities and provide customer support  hsd costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity and customer provisioning  phone service costs  including delivery and other expenses  and field operating costs  including outside contractors  vehicle  utilities and pole rental expenses 
these costs generally rise because of customer growth  contractual increases in video programming rates and inflationary cost increases for personnel  outside vendors and other expenses 
costs relating to personnel and their support may increase as the percentage of our expenses that we can capitalize declines due to lower levels of new service installations 
cable network related costs also fluctuate with the level of investment we make  including the use of our own personnel  in the cable network 
we anticipate that our service costs will continue to grow  but should remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues  with the exception of programming costs  which we discuss below 
video programming expenses  which are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  have historically been our largest single expense item 
in recent years  we have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of our programming  particularly sports and local broadcast programming  well in excess of the inflation rate or the change in the consumer price index 
we believe that these expenses will continue to grow  principally due to contractual unit rate increases and the increasing demands of sports programmers and television broadcast station owners for retransmission consent fees 
while such growth in programming expenses can be partially offset by rate increases  it is expected that our video gross margins will decline as increases in programming costs outpace growth in video revenues 
significant selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call centers  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  marketing  bad debt  billing  advertising  and office costs related to telecommunications and office administration 
these costs typically rise because of customer growth and inflationary cost increases for employees and other expenses  but we expect such costs should remain fairly consistent as a percentage of revenues 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 

table of contents adjusted oibda we define adjusted oibda as operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results but is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs 
we believe adjusted oibda is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management  and provides a measure that can be used to analyze  value and compare the companies in the cable industry  which may have different depreciation and amortization policies  as well as different non cash  share based compensation programs 
adjusted oibda and similar measures are used in calculating compliance with the covenants of our debt arrangements 
a limitation of adjusted oibda  however  is that it excludes depreciation and amortization  which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business 
management utilizes a separate process to budget  measure and evaluate capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted oibda has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda should not be regarded as an alternative to either operating income or net income loss as an indicator of operating performance nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that operating income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted oibda

as of december   our sources of cash included million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and unused and available commitments of million under our million revolving credit facilities 
in the longer term  specifically and beyond  we may not have enough cash available to satisfy our maturing term loans and senior notes 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient future financing or  if we not able to do so on similar terms as we currently experience  we may need to take other actions to conserve or raise capital that we would not take otherwise 
however  we have accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past  and expect to continue to be able to access these markets in the future as necessary 
recent developments in the credit markets we have assessed  and will continue to assess  the impact  if any  of the recent distress and volatility in the capital and credit markets on our financial position 
further disruptions in such markets could cause our counterparty banks to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us  potentially reducing amounts available to us under our revolving credit commitments or subjecting us to greater credit risk with respect to our interest rate exchange agreements 
at this time  we are not aware of any of our counterparty banks being in a position where they would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us 
although we may be exposed to future consequences in the event of such counterparties non performance  we do not expect any such outcomes to be material

our unused revolving commitments expire in the amounts of million  million and million on march   september  and december   respectively 
we use interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  in order to fix the rate of the applicable eurodollar portion of debt under our credit facilities to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had current interest rate swaps with various banks pursuant to which the interest rate on billion of floating rate debt was fixed at a weighted average rate of

covenant compliance and debt ratings for all periods through december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our credit facilities and senior note arrangements 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in our credit facilities or senior note arrangements that are based on changes in our credit rating assigned by any rating agency 
we do not believe that we will have any difficulty complying with any of the applicable covenants in the foreseeable future 
our future access to the debt markets and the terms and conditions we receive are influenced by our debt ratings 
our corporate credit ratings are b  with a stable outlook  by moody s  and b  with a stable outlook  by standard and poor s 
any future downgrade to our credit ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuance than we currently experience  or adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds

interest expense amounts are net of amounts capitalized 
we have contracts with programmers who provide video programming services to our subscribers 
our contracts typically provide that we have an obligation to purchase video programming for our subscribers as long as we deliver cable services to such subscribers 
we have no obligation to purchase these services if we are not providing cable services  except when we do not have the right to cancel the underlying contract or for contracts with a guaranteed minimum commitment 
we have included such amounts in our purchase obligations above  as follows million for  and million for and for and thereafter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with asc no 
entertainment cable television formerly sfas no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies 
costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer s dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services 
capitalized costs included all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets 
we use standard costing models  developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data  to determine our capitalized amounts 
these models include labor rates  overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities 
the development of these standards involves significant judgment by management  especially in the development of standards for our newer  advanced products and services in which historical data is limited 
changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any 
table of contents changes to these estimates  which may be significant  are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed 
valuation and impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles as of december   we had approximately billion of unamortized intangible assets  including goodwill of million and franchise rights of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
these intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
our cable systems operate under non exclusive cable franchises  or franchise rights  granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as of december   we held  franchises in areas located throughout the united states 
the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new subscribers and to market new products and services  such as advanced digital television  hsd and phone  in a specific market territory 
we concluded that our franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these franchise rights contribute to our revenues and cash flows 
goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
in accordance with asc no 
intangibles goodwill and other asc formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize franchise rights and goodwill 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we follow the provisions of asc to test our goodwill and franchise rights for impairment 
we assess the fair values of each cable system cluster using discounted cash flow dcf methodology  under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner 
our dcf analysis uses significant level unobservable inputs 
this assessment involves significant judgment  including certain assumptions and estimates that determine future cash flow expectations and other future benefits  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
these assumptions and estimates included discount rates  estimated growth rates  terminal growth rates  comparable company data  revenues per customer  market penetration as a percentage of homes passed and operating margin 
we also consider market transactions  market valuations  research analyst estimates and other valuations using multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization to confirm the reasonableness of fair values determined by the dcf methodology 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
such impairments  if recognized  could potentially be material 
based on the guidance outlined in asc formerly eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the unit of accounting  or reporting unit  for testing goodwill and franchise rights for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the reporting unit level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have two reporting units for the purpose of applying asc  mediacom broadband and mediacom llc 
in accordance with asc  we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  calculated using the residual method  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for our franchise rights and other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 

table of contents since our adoption of asc in  we have not recorded any impairments as a result of our impairment testing 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights  goodwill or other intangible assets 
because there has not been a change in the fundamentals of our business  we do not believe that our stock price is the sole indicator of the underlying value of the assets in our reporting units 
we have therefore determined that the short term volatility in our stock price does not qualify as a triggering event under asc  and as such  no interim impairment test is required as of december  we could record impairments in the future if there are changes in the long term fundamentals of our business  in general market conditions or in the regulatory landscape that could prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our long lived intangible assets 
in the near term  the economic conditions currently affecting the us economy and how that may impact the fundamentals of our business  together with the recent volatility in our stock price  may have a negative impact on the fair values of the assets in our reporting units 
for illustrative purposes  if there were a hypothetical decline of and in the fair values determined for cable franchise rights at our mediacom broadband reporting unit  an impairment loss of million and million  respectively  would result as of our impairment testing date of october  in addition  a hypothetical decline of up to in the fair values determined for goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets at the same reporting unit  would not result in any impairment loss as of october  a hypothetical decline of up to in the fair values determined for goodwill  cable franchise rights and other finite lived intangible assets at our mediacom llc reporting unit would not result in any impairment loss as of october  income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by asc this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards  we assess all available positive and negative evidence including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
in forecasting future taxable income  we use assumptions that require significant judgment and are consistent with the estimates we use to manage our business 
at december   the valuation allowances totaled million  which reflected the reversal of a substantial portion of our valuation balances from prior periods which occurred during the fourth quarter of we adjusted our valuation allowances because we determined that there was a sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowances in accordance with asc our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowances 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periods the estimates are revised 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates

inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the fcc s existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable services to more than cover any increases in programming 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we use interest rate exchange agreements with counterparty banks to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   we had billion of current interest rate swaps with various banks with a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
we also had billion of forward starting interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed rate of approximately  of which billion and billion commence during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fixed rates of the interest rate swaps are offset against the applicable eurodollar rate to determine the related interest expense 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the other parties  however  we do not anticipate the nonperformance of any of our counterparties 
at december   based on the mark to market valuation  we would have paid approximately million  including accrued interest  if we terminated these interest rate swaps
