item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements 
in some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions  risks  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the sec 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
following is a discussion of some of the more significant risks that could materially impact our business 
the challenging global economic environment and the downturn in the markets we serve could continue to adversely affect our operating results and stock price in a material manner 
the challenging global economic environment could continue to cause substantial reductions in our revenue and results of operations as a result of weaker demand by the end users of our products and  for some products  price erosion 
such price erosion may occur through competitors becoming more aggressive in their pricing practices  which could adversely impact our gross margins 
these global economic conditions also make it difficult for our customers  our vendors  and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
our customers also may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  impairing their ability to pay us  which could have an adverse effect on results of operation if such events cause delays in collection or write offs of receivables due to customer insolvencies 
further  the demand for many of our products is economically sensitive and will vary with general economic activity  trends in nonresidential construction  investment in manufacturing facilities and automation  demand for information technology equipment  and other economic factors 
we may be unable to successfully implement our strategic plan 
our strategic plan is designed to improve revenues and profitability  reduce costs  and improve working capital management 
to achieve these goals  our strategic priorities are to improve our market delivery system so as to capture market share through end user engagement  channel management  and vertical strategy  improve our recruitment and development of talented associates  develop strong global connector  fiber  and wireless platforms  acquire businesses that fit our strategic plan  and become a leading lean company 
we have a disciplined process for deploying this strategic plan through our associates 
there is a risk that we may not be successful in executing these measures to achieve the expected results for a variety of reasons  including market developments  economic conditions  shortcomings in establishing appropriate action plans  or challenges with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously 
for example  our market delivery system initiative may not succeed or we may lose market share due to challenges in choosing the right products to market  integrating products of acquired companies into our sales and marketing strategy  or strategically bidding against oem partners  we may not be able to acquire businesses that fit our strategic plan on acceptable business terms  or we may not achieve our other strategic priorities 
lean refers to a business management system that strives to create value for customers and deliver that value to the right place  at the right time  and in the right quantities while reducing or eliminating waste from all processes 

table of contents we rely on several key distributors in marketing our products 
the majority of our sales are through distributors 
these distributors carry the products of competitors along with our products 
our largest distributor customer  anixter international inc  accounted for of our revenue in if we were to lose a key distributor  our revenue and profits would likely be reduced  at least temporarily 
in the past  we have seen some distributors acquired and consolidated 
if there were further consolidation of the electronics and cable distributors  this could have an effect on our relationships with these distributors 
it could also result in consolidation of distributor inventory  which would temporarily depress our revenue 
we have also experienced financial failure of distributors from time to time  resulting in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full 
the current global economic downturn raises the potential of our customers incurring financial difficulties including bankruptcy  which would adversely impact our results of operation as a result of lower customer sales and write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable 
the global cable  connectivity  and networking industries are highly competitive 
we compete with other manufacturers of cable  connectivity  and networking products  and also face potential competition  in north america  europe and asia 
these companies compete on price  reputation and quality  product technology and characteristics  and terms 
actions that may be taken by competitors  including pricing  business alliances  new product introductions  and other actions  could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability 
we may encounter difficulties with restructuring issues  including difficulties in realigning manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products 
as part of our lean culture to pursue continuous improvement  we periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to improve our long term competitive position 
we have also taken these measures in response to the challenging global economic environment 
the implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities 
there are significant risks inherent in implementing these initiatives  including that we have adequate production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities  we can effectively deal with employee issues arising from a plant shut down or reduction in workforce especially at our european facilities that are typically unionized or require that we consult or obtain approval of representatives of the workforce before taking such action  we maintain product quality as a result of shifting capacity  we can successfully remove  transport and re install equipment  we have trained personnel at the new site  and we can effectively change the management reporting structure  including providing accurate information to decision makers under the new structure 
if these initiatives are not successfully implemented  we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs as well as customer and employee relations problems  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our profitability 
copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our products 
over the past three years  the prices of metals  particularly copper  have been highly volatile 
copper rose rapidly in price for much of this period and remains a volatile commodity 
prices of other materials we use  such as pvc and other plastics derived from 
table of contents petrochemical feedstocks  have also been volatile 
generally  we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products 
the majority of our products are sold through distribution  and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time  with new prices taking effect a few weeks after they are announced 
some oem contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes  generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months 
if we are unable to raise prices sufficiently to recover our material costs  our earnings will be reduced 
if we raise our prices but competitors raise their prices less  we may lose sales  and our earnings will be reduced 
if the price of copper were to decline  we may be compelled to reduce prices to remain competitive  which could have a negative effect on revenue 
we believe the supply of raw materials copper  plastics  and other materials is adequate and we do not expect any substantial interruption of supply or shortage of materials 
if such a supply interruption or shortage were to occur  however  this could have a negative effect on revenue and earnings 
we may experience significant variability in our quarterly and annual effective tax rate 
we have a complex tax profile due to the global nature of our operations  which encompass multiple taxing jurisdictions 
variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities  identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties  changes in tax laws and rates  and the extent to which we are able to realize net operating loss and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets  among other matters  may significantly impact our effective income tax rate in the future 
our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in which we do business 
our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions impacts our effective tax rate 
relatively  more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions or relatively  more losses in lower tax rate jurisdictions would increase our effective tax rate and thus lower our net income 
if we generate losses in tax jurisdictions for which no benefits are available  our effective income tax rate will increase 
a significant increase in our effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
because we do business in many countries  our results of operations are affected by changes in currency exchange rates and are subject to political and economic uncertainties 
more than half of our sales are outside the united states 
other than the united states dollar  the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations and sales are the euro  the canadian dollar  the hong kong dollar  the chinese yuan  the mexican peso  the australian dollar  and the british pound 
in most cases  we have revenues and costs in the same currency  thereby reducing our overall currency risk  although the realignment of our manufacturing capacity among our global facilities may alter this balance 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the results of our non us operations are translated at a lower exchange rate and thus into lower reported earnings 
we have manufacturing facilities in china  canada  mexico  and several european countries 
we rely on suppliers in many countries  including china 
our foreign operations are subject to economic and political risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad such as economic and political destabilization  land use risks  international conflicts  restrictive actions by foreign governments  and adverse foreign tax laws 
if we are unable to retain senior management and key employees  our business operations could be adversely affected 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience  and efforts of our senior management and key employees 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees including due to acquisitions or restructuring activities could have an adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find qualified replacements for these individuals or that the integration of potential replacements would not be disruptive to our business 
more broadly  a key determinant of our success is our ability to attract and retain talented associates 
while this is one of our strategic priorities  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in this regard 

table of contents volatility of credit markets could adversely affect our business 
uncertainty in us and global financial and equity markets could make it more expensive for us to conduct our operations and may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete acquisitions 
our strategic plan includes further acquisitions 
our ability to successfully acquire businesses may decline if the competition among potential buyers increases or the cost of acquiring suitable businesses becomes too expensive 
as a result  we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire 
our ability to implement our business strategy and grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of acquired businesses 
should we fail to integrate their operations  our results of operations and profitability could be negatively impacted 
aside from the challenges of realigning existing operations  we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses and future acquisitions might not meet our performance expectations 
some of the integration challenges we might face include differences in corporate culture and management styles  additional or conflicting governmental regulations  preparation of the acquired operations for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  financial reporting that is not in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  disparate company policies and practices  customer relationship issues  and retention of key personnel 
in addition  management may be required to devote a considerable amount of time to the integration process  which could decrease the amount of time we have to manage the other businesses 
some of the businesses we acquired or are interested in acquiring involve more complex technology and shorter product life cycles than are typical for belden  and we might not be able to properly evaluate and develop the technology 
we cannot make assurances that we will successfully or cost effectively integrate operations 
the failure to do so could have a negative effect on results of operations or profitability 
the process of integrating operations could cause some interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  the activities of acquired businesses 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
our markets are characterized by the introduction of products with increasing technological capabilities  including fiber optic and wireless signal transmission solutions that compete with the copper cable solutions that comprise the majority of our revenue 
the relative costs and merits of copper cable solutions  fiber optic cable solutions  and wireless solutions could change in the future as various competing technologies address the market opportunities 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products that meet or anticipate such changes 
we have long been successful in introducing successive generations of more capable products  but if we were to fail to keep pace with technology or with the products of competitors  we might lose market share and harm our reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets 
competing technologies could cause the obsolescence of many of our products 
see the discussion above in part i  item  under importance of new products and product improvements  impact of technological change  impact of acquisitions we face risk associated with missed opportunities 
our business decisions are influenced by market intelligence we receive at micro and macro levels  which information may be incomplete or inaccurate  resulting in missed opportunities 
we may suffer a loss in our product quality  adversely affecting our business 
due to several factors including the migration of our production to low cost regions  third party outsourcing of our production  and a potential reduced emphasis on quality arising from personnel changes  there is a risk that our 
table of contents products may suffer a decline in quality or that our on time delivery rate may fall 
these developments could damage our brand reputation and result in lower sales 
we rely on several key original equipment manufacturers oems in marketing our trapeze wireless products 
we sell and license a significant portion of our wireless trapeze products under private label to oem partners  who market the products and technology under their own brand names 
in the past  we have seen one oem partner acquired and consolidated  resulting in lower trapeze sales 
if there were further consolidations of our trapeze oem partners  this could have an adverse effect on sales if the consolidated oem purchases wireless products from trapeze competitors 
trapeze also has experienced financial failure including bankruptcy of its oem partners from time to time  resulting in reduced sales and in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full 
the current global economic downturn raises the potential of such trapeze customers incurring financial difficulties including bankruptcy  which would adversely impact trapeze s results of operation as a result of lower customer sales and write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable 
if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired  we may be required to recognize charges that would reduce our income 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually  or more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable 
we have incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the past  and we may be required to do so again in future periods 
such a charge would reduce our income without any change to our underlying cash flow 
this list of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other considerations besides those mentioned above might cause our actual results to differ from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement 
we have defined benefit pension plans that are not fully funded 
we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states  the united kingdom  canada  and germany 
the cash funding requirements for these plans depends on the financial performance of the funds assets  actuarial life expectancies  discount rates  and other factors 
the fair value of the assets in the plans may be less than the projected benefits owed by us 
in most years  we are required to contribute cash to fund the pension plans  and the amount of funding required may vary significantly 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans in future contributions we may make to fund our pension plans may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we might have difficulty protecting our intellectual property from use by competitors  or competitors might accuse us of violating their intellectual property rights 
disagreements about patents and intellectual property rights occur in our served markets  especially for wireless 
there  third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us or against our customers or channel partners for which we may be liable 
due to the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless industry  much of the wireless business relies on proprietary technologies of third parties  and to the extent our products may need these technologies  we may not be able to obtain  or continue to obtain  licenses from such third parties on reasonable terms 
furthermore  a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services 
potential problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and operations 
we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders  shipping of products  billing our customers  tracking inventory  supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation  paying our employees  and otherwise running our business 
any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 
in addition  we 
table of contents may need to enhance our information systems to provide additional capabilities and functionality 
the implementation of new information systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise 
any disruptions impacting our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis could adversely affect our business in a number of respects 
if we are unable to successfully implement information systems enhancements  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
some of our employees are members of collective bargaining groups  and we might be subject to labor actions that would interrupt our business 
some of our employees  primarily outside the united states  are members of collective bargaining units 
we believe that our relations with employees are generally good 
however  if there were a dispute with one of these bargaining units  the affected operations could be interrupted resulting in lost revenues  lost profit contribution  and customer dissatisfaction 
we are subject to current environmental and other laws and regulations  including the risks associated with possible climate change legislation 
we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we do business 
we are currently  and may in the future be  held responsible for remedial investigations and clean up costs of certain sites damaged by the discharge of hazardous substances  including sites that have never been owned or operated by us but at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws 
changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 
greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of attention 
bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress 
in addition  future regulation of greenhouse gas could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations or statutory or regulatory changes under existing environmental laws 
while not all are likely to become law  additional climate change regulation may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices and requiring equipment modification or replacement 
aside from regulating greenhouse gases  the us congress is considering legislation creating a cap and trade system that would establish a limit or cap on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or allowances 
we as an energy user may incur increased energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances  which they would be required to obtain  to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the company or its energy suppliers 
other countries are also considering or have implemented cap and trade systems 
future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change are possible  which could materially increase operating costs in our industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs

item legal proceedings we are a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to our operations 
these proceedings include personal injury cases  of which are pending as of february   in which we are one of many defendants 
electricians have filed a majority of these cases  primarily in pennsylvania and illinois  generally seeking compensatory  special  and punitive damages 
typically in these cases  the claimant alleges injury from alleged exposure to a heat resistant asbestos fiber 
our alleged predecessors had a small number of products that contained the fiber  but ceased production of such products more than years ago 
through february   we have been dismissed  or reached agreement to be dismissed  in more than similar cases without any going to trial  and with only a small number of these involving any payment to the claimant 
in our opinion  the proceedings and actions in which we are involved should not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results  or cash flows 
however  since the trends and outcome of this litigation are inherently uncertain  we cannot give absolute assurance regarding the future resolution of such litigation  or that such litigation may not become material in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  and market cable  connectivity  and networking products in markets including industrial automation  enterprise  transportation  infrastructure  and consumer electronics 
we strive to create shareholder value by capturing additional market share by improving channel and end user relationships  and concentrating sales efforts on vertical markets  investing in both organic and inorganic growth in fast growing regions  continuously improving business processes throughout the enterprise via a comprehensive lean tool set and the institution of a continuous improvement mind set across the company  migrating our manufacturing capacity to low cost locations within each major geographic region to be closer to our customers and to reduce the landed cost of our products  managing our product portfolio to position products according to value  eliminate low margin revenue  and increase revenue in higher margin and strategically important products  recruiting and developing the best talent we can find and improving the effectiveness of our performance management processes  and protecting and enhancing the value of the belden brand and our family of brands 
to accomplish these goals  we use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality  delivery  cost  and innovation 
we consider revenue growth  operating margin  cash flows  return on invested capital  and working capital management metrics to be our key operating performance indicators 
we also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve the objectives described above 
the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect our overall growth  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
approximately of our sales were derived outside the united states in as a global business  our operations are affected by worldwide  regional  and industry economic and political factors 
our market and geographic diversity limits the impact of any one market or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 
our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers  including to the extent possible their sales  to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 
in addition  we use indices concerning general economic trends to predict our outlook for the future given the broad range of products manufactured and end markets served 
although consolidated revenues grew each quarter sequentially throughout  we continued to experience broad based market declines compared to prior years 
as a result  consolidated revenues for decreased from we continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served 
our performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force  expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets such as china and india  migration away from a fragmented  sub scale  high cost manufacturing footprint  and potential volatility in raw material costs 
although we use the united states dollar as our reporting currency  a substantial portion of our assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows reside in or are derived from countries other than the united states 
these assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows are translated from local currencies into the united states dollar using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
we have generally accepted the exposure to currency exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the united states dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents significant trends and events in many of our customers are distributors that stock inventory for resale 
due to the weakening demand experienced throughout the global economy  many of our customers have lowered their inventory balances during our revenues are negatively impacted by these inventory reductions 
our customers may continue this trend 
in  we sold a ownership interest in a german cable business that sells primarily to the automotive industry 
the sales price was million  and we recognized a loss of million on the transaction 
in addition to retaining a interest in the business  we retained the associated land and building  which we are leasing to the buyer 
prior to the sale  we determined that certain long lived assets of that german cable business were impaired 
we estimated the fair market value of these assets based upon the terms of the sales agreement and recognized an impairment loss of million in the operating results of the emea segment 
in addition to the sale of a german cable business  we incurred other restructuring charges related to our plan to streamline our manufacturing  sales  and administrative functions worldwide in an effort to reduce costs and mitigate the weakening demand experienced throughout the global economy 
in  we recognized severance costs and asset impairment losses of million and million  respectively  related to these restructuring actions

in  cost of sales included million of severance and other restructuring costs 
these costs primarily relate to global restructuring actions to further streamline our manufacturing functions worldwide in an effort to reduce costs and mitigate the weakening demand experienced throughout the global economy 
other restructuring costs include equipment transfer costs  contract termination costs  employee relocation costs  and other restructuring related charges 
cost of sales in included million of severance and other restructuring costs 
excluding the impact of these items  gross profit margin in increased basis points due to cost reductions from our lean enterprise strategies and global restructuring actions

in addition  the carrying amounts of certain trademarks exceeded their respective fair values resulting in a trademark impairment charge of million 
in  we also recognized tangible asset impairment losses totaling million primarily related to decisions to close our manufacturing facility in manchester  connecticut  consolidate capacity  and dispose of excess machinery and equipment

table of contents pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements discussion regarding our pending adoption of accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we provide a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs in the period in which the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the products specified in the customer s purchase order or sales agreement 
sales from our wireless segment often involve multiple elements  principally hardware  software  hardware and software maintenance  and other support services 
when a sale involves multiple elements  we allocate the proceeds from the arrangement to each respective element based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and recognize revenue when each element s revenue recognition criteria are met 
vsoe of fair value for each element is established based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established  the proceeds from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period related to the last delivered element 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to existing guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued an update to existing guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vsoe or third party evidence of the selling price for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we expect to early adopt the new guidance on january  we expect this new guidance will affect revenue recognition for our wireless segment by significantly decreasing the amount of revenue that is deferred on arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accounts receivable at the time of sale  we establish an estimated reserve for trade  promotion  and other special price reductions such as contract pricing  discounts to meet competitor pricing  and on time payment discounts 
we also adjust receivables balances for  among other things  correction of billing errors  incorrect shipments  and settlement of customer disputes 
customers are allowed to return inventory if and when certain conditions regarding the physical state of the inventory and our approval of the return are met 
certain distribution customers are allowed to return inventory at original cost  in an amount not to exceed three percent of the prior year s purchases  in exchange for an order of equal or greater value 
until we can process these reductions  corrections  and returns together  the 
table of contents adjustments through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding adjustments and recognize them against our gross accounts receivable and gross revenues 
we also adjust inventory and cost of sales for the estimated level of returns 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated sales demand  trends in product pricing  and historical and anticipated adjustments patterns 
we make revisions to these estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to further reduce prices and increase customer return authorizations 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the specific identification method 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of accounts receivable  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings  or bankruptcy 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability or unwillingness to pay outstanding amounts  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to its estimated collectible balance 
there have been occasions in the past where we recognized an expense associated with the rapid collapse of a distributor for which no specific reserve had been previously established 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
inventories we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis in light of sales demand  technological changes  product life cycle  component cost trends  product pricing  and inventory condition 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of historical and anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition  or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before taxes under gaap 
deferred tax assets generally represent future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required when some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we are required to estimate taxable income in future years or develop tax strategies that would enable tax asset realization in each taxing jurisdiction and use judgment to determine whether or not to record a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
we have significant tax credit carryforwards in the united states on which we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
the utilization of these credits is dependent upon the recognition of both us taxable income as well as income characterized as foreign source under the us tax laws 
the company expects to generate enough taxable income in the future to be able to utilize these tax credits 
furthermore  in we expect to implement tax planning strategies that will help generate sufficient foreign source income in the carryforward period 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
we establish accruals for uncertain tax positions when  despite the belief that our tax return positions will more likely than not be sustained upon examination  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that the full amount of the associated tax benefit may not be realized 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  there could be a material effect on our income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  certain portions of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed income are 
table of contents considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  we do not record a provision for united states federal and state income taxes on this foreign income 
if this income was not considered to be indefinitely reinvested  it would be subject to united states federal and state income taxes and could materially effect our income tax provision 
long lived assets the valuation and classification of long lived assets and the assignment of depreciation and amortization useful lives and salvage values involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these long lived assets under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of asset groups and reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
we test our tangible long lived assets and intangible long lived assets subject to amortization for impairment when indicators of impairment exist 
we test our goodwill and intangible long lived assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
we base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are not predictable with precision and therefore are inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
when we evaluate goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value using the income approach as reconciled to our aggregate market capitalization 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using growth rates and discount rates that are consistent with current market conditions in our industry 
for example  in our goodwill impairment analysis  the discount rates for our reporting units ranged from to and the long term growth rates ranged from to 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill as a component of operating income 
accrued sales rebates we grant incentive rebates to participating distributors as part of our sales programs 
the rebates are determined based on certain targeted sales volumes 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually in either cash or receivables credits 
until we can process these rebates through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and recognize them as accrued liabilities and reductions in our gross revenues 
we base our estimates on both historical and anticipated sales demand and rebate program participation 
we charge revisions to these estimates back to accrued liabilities and revenues in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to increase sales rebates offered  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in accrued liabilities and an incremental reduction in revenues at the time the rebate is offered 
pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates  and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high quality corporate long term bonds 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future or near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of the lesser of of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 

table of contents share based compensation we compensate certain employees with various forms of share based payment awards and recognize compensation costs for these awards based on their fair values 
the fair values of certain awards are estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which incorporates certain assumptions regarding the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility 
we develop the expected term assumption based on the vesting period and contractual term of an award  our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation experience  our stock price history  plan provisions that require exercise or cancellation of awards after employees terminate  and the extent to which currently available information indicates that the future is reasonably expected to differ from past experience 
we develop the expected volatility assumption based on historical price data for our common stock and other economic data trended into future years 
after calculating the aggregate fair value of an award  we use an estimated forfeiture rate to discount the amount of share based compensation cost to be recognized in our operating results over the service period of the award 
we develop the forfeiture assumption based on our historical pre vesting cancellation experience 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the business combination date 
we also identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
we have historically relied upon the use of third party valuation specialists to assist in the estimation of fair values for tangible long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill 
the carrying values of acquired receivables  inventories  and accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values at the business combination date 
with respect to accrued liabilities acquired  we use all available information to make our best estimates of their fair values at the business combination date 
when necessary  we rely upon the use of third party actuaries to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices  interest rates  and credit extended to customers 
each of these risks is discussed below 
currency exchange rate risk for most of our products  the currency in which we sell the product is the same as the currency in which we incur the costs to manufacture the product  resulting in a natural hedge 
our currency exchange rate management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as the offsetting or netting of like currency cash flows 
we do not generally use foreign currency derivatives and did not have any outstanding at december  we generally view our investments in international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the united states dollar as long term 
as a result  we do not generally use derivatives to manage these net investments 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  we are exposed primarily to exchange rate movements between the united states dollar and the euro  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar  chinese yuan  mexican peso  australian dollar  and british pound 
our net foreign currency investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into united states dollars using year end exchange rates was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we estimate a one percent change of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would have changed pre tax income loss of our foreign operations by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis has inherent limitations as it assumes that rates of multiple foreign currencies will always move in the same direction relative to the value of the united states dollar over time 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used by us are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  political and economic variables  and other unpredictable factors 
the primary purpose of our commodity price management activities is to manage the volatility associated with purchases of commodities in the normal course of business 
we do not speculate on commodity prices 

table of contents we are exposed to price risk related to our purchase of copper used in the manufacture of our products 
our copper price management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as purchasing copper for future delivery at fixed prices 
we do not generally use commodity price derivatives and did not have any outstanding at december  the following table presents unconditional copper purchase obligations outstanding at december  the unconditional copper purchase obligations settle during purchase fair amount value in thousands  except average price unconditional copper purchase obligations commitment volume in pounds weighted average price per pound commitment amounts we are also exposed to price risk related to our purchase of selected commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks used in the manufacture of our products 
we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices established with the vendors as part of the purchase process 
pricing of these commodities are volatile as they tend to fluctuate with the price of oil 
historically  we have not used commodity financial instruments to hedge prices for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks 
interest rate risk we have occasionally managed our debt portfolio by using interest rate derivative instruments  such as swap agreements  to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
we were not a party to any interest rate derivative instruments at december  or during the year then ended 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal amounts by expected maturity dates and fair values as of december  principal amount by expected maturity fair thereafter total value in thousands  except interest rates fixed rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate fixed rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate variable rate senior secured credit facility interest rate at december  total because the senior secured credit facility has a variable interest rate  its carrying value approximates fair value 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one financial institution 
although we do not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments  we evaluate the credit standing of the counterparty financial institutions 
at december   we had million in accounts receivable outstanding from anixter international inc anixter 
this represented approximately of our total accounts receivable outstanding at december  anixter generally pays all outstanding receivables within thirty to sixty days of invoice receipt
