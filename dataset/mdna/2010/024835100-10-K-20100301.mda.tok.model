item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
on june   we completed the acquisition of gmh s student housing business 
at the time of closing  the gmh student housing portfolio consisted of wholly owned properties containing  beds located in various markets throughout the country 
two of the acquired properties totaling  beds were sold in the third quarter of and one property totaling beds was sold on december  the total consideration paid for gmh was approximately  million  inclusive of transaction costs 
property portfolio as of december   our total property portfolio contained student housing properties with approximately  beds and  apartment units  all of which we manage 
our communities contain modern housing units and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming  with many offering resort style amenities 
as of december   our property portfolio included wholly owned properties  which consisted of owned off campus properties that are in close proximity to colleges and universities in states and two owned on campus properties 
the net operating income of these student housing communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired student housing communities 
our primary business objectives are to create long term stockholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire student housing communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
the construction of our two owned on campus properties was funded with our equity through the ace program which enables colleges and universities to preserve their credit capacity to fund core academic infrastructure 
each of these properties operate under a ground facility lease with a related university system 
additionally  we participate with two university systems in the ownership of four on campus properties under long term ground facility leases  we refer to these properties as our on campus participating properties 
third party development and management services we also provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the state university of new york system  the university of california system  the university of houston system  the texas a m university system  the texas state university system  the university of georgia system  the university of north carolina system  the purdue university system  the university of colorado system  and the west virginia university system 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
since  we have developed and assisted in securing financing for third party student housing properties 
as of december   we were under contract on three projects that are currently in progress and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of march through august as of december   we owned a noncontrolling interest in two joint ventures that owned an aggregate of student housing properties with approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we also provided third party management and leasing services for properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units  five of which we developed 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to multi year management contracts that have an initial term that ranges from one to five years 
as of december   our total owned  joint venture and third party managed portfolio was comprised of properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our wholly owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services development revenues are generally recognized based on a proportionate performance method based on contract deliverables  while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
costs associated with such projects are deferred and recognized in relation to the revenues earned on executed contracts 
for projects where our fee is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net fee generated on those projects 
incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
we also evaluate the collectibility of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances  including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects  and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred  until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
because we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained  we bear the risk of loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
as such  management evaluates the status of third party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues 
such write offs are included in third party development and management services expenses in the case of third party development projects or general and administrative expenses in the case of owned development projects on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
long lived assets impairment on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
outperformance bonus plan the outperformance bonus plan was adopted upon consummation of our ipo in august  and consisted of awards to key employees equal to the value of  shares of our common stock 
compensation related to these awards was not recorded until when management determined that certain of the required performance measures were probable of achievement 
such awards vested on the third anniversary of the ipo august  upon our achievement of specified performance measures 
upon vesting  the compensation committee of the board of directors exercised its permitted discretion and granted  of the awards to selected recipients in the form of profits interest units pius  with the remainder of the awards paid in cash in the amount of million 
a compensation charge of approximately million was recorded during the year ended december   to reflect the value of such awards 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods

new property operations 
for the year ended december   the gmh student housing properties contributed an additional million of revenues and an additional million of operating expenses 
in addition  we acquired two properties in february pirate s place  located near the campus of east carolina university in greenville  north carolina  and sunnyside commons  located near the campus of west virginia university in morgantown  west virginia 
in august  we completed construction of and opened vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge  and in august we completed construction of and opened barrett honors college 
these five non gmh new properties contributed an additional million of revenues and an additional million of operating expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had properties containing  beds which were operating during both the years ended december  and these properties produced revenues of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  in addition to an increase in average occupancy from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing same store properties  operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing costs incurred to stimulate leasing velocity for the academic year 
we anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  employee benefit costs  property taxes and general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations we had four participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both the years ended december  and revenues from our participating properties increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily a result of an increase in average rental rates during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
at these properties  operating expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to hurricane costs incurred during the year ended december  that were not incurred in the current year 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  employee benefit costs and general inflation 
third party development services revenue third party development services revenue decreased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily related to the closing and commencement of construction of the university of california  irvine phase iii project in august  which contributed an additional million to third party development services revenue during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the university of hawaii manoa and concordia university projects were completed in august and closing and commencement of construction occurred for the highlands at edinboro university of pennsylvania project in february these three projects combined contributed million of additional third party development services revenue during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these decreases were offset by the commencement of construction of the cleveland state university phase ii project in august  which resulted in million in third party development services revenue recognized during the year ended december  closing of third party development services projects during will be dependent upon the company s university clients obtaining project financing  which has been adversely affected by current capital market conditions 
development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project 
in addition  to the extent projects are completed under budget  we may be entitled to a portion of such savings  which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
it is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
third party management services revenue third party management services revenues increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an additional million in management fees recognized during the year ended december  from third party management contracts assumed as part of the gmh acquisition in june  including properties owned in two joint ventures with fidelity in which we have a interest 
additionally  we assumed management of four properties located in canada  which contributed an additional million of third party management services revenue for the year ended december  finally  during and we assumed management of additional phases at our hampton roads military housing project  which also contributed an additional million of third party management services revenue during the year ended december  we anticipate that third party management services revenues in will increase as compared with as a result of new contracts obtained during and contracts anticipated to commence in resident services revenue revenue from resident services represents certain services and resident amenities deemed to be noncustomary for a property s geographic region that are required under federal tax laws to be provided by our trs entities 
resident services revenues decreased approximately million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the type and level of such services provided during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
third party development and management services expenses third party development and management services expenses increased by million  from million during the year ended year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of an increase in activity for potential ace projects and new management contracts assumed from gmh 
third party development and management services expenses for will be dependent on the level of awards we pursue  the level of new management contracts obtained  and as previously mentioned  any pre development costs charged against income for projects which do not close 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to merger costs incurred during the year ended year ended december  related to our acquisition of gmh in june we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase in as a result of an increase in employee benefit costs and general inflation 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the gmh student housing business in june  which contributed an additional million to depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   of which million related to the valuation assigned to in place leases for such properties 
the increase was also due to the completion of construction and opening of vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge in august and barrett honors college in august  which contributed an additional million to depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in as a result of the value assigned to in place leases at the time of the gmh acquisition being fully amortized in  which should be slightly offset by increased depreciation on both barrett honors college  placed in service during  and renovations during at several gmh properties 
ground lease expense ground lease expense increased million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to ground facility lease costs incurred for vista del sol and barrett honors college  which completed construction and opened in august and august  respectively 
we expect ground lease expense in to increase slightly due to anticipated improved operating results of the on campus participating properties which should increase our portion of cash flow available for distribution 
interest income interest income decreased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to interest earned on proceeds from our april equity offering  which were not utilized until the closing of our acquisition of gmh in june  as well as a decrease in interest rates during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
interest expense interest expense increased million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to million of mortgage debt assumed from gmh in june  which contributed an additional million of interest expense for the year ended december  we also incurred an additional million of interest expense during the year ended december  related to the senior secured term loan entered into in may  as well as an additional million of interest expense related to the million secured freddie mac revolving credit facility entered into in september these increases were offset by a million decrease to interest expense related to the pay off of million of mortgage loans during the year ended december  assuming that variable interest rates only increase slightly during  we expect interest expense in to be consistent with due to the pay off of mortgage debt scheduled to mature in  which would be offset by additional interest expense incurred on anticipated borrowings from our corporate level debt 
amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the amortization of additional finance costs incurred to assume debt on properties acquired from gmh  the senior secured term loan entered into in may  and the freddie mac revolving credit facility entered into in september we anticipate that amortization of deferred financing costs will increase in due to the refinancing of our existing secured revolving credit facility in august  and the secured agency facility entered into in september loss from unconsolidated joint ventures loss from unconsolidated joint ventures represents our share of the net loss from the hampton roads military housing joint venture in which we have a minimal economic interest  as well as our share of the loss from two joint ventures owning properties formed or assumed as part of our acquisition of gmh in june loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the loss from the two joint ventures formed or assumed as part of our acquisition of gmh in june income tax provision the company s provision for income taxes increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of additional state tax liabilities accrued related to the acquisition of the gmh portfolio in june discontinued operations riverside estates  a wholly owned property  was sold in december for million and the resulting loss from disposition of million is included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  in addition  as part of the acquisition of gmh on june   the company acquired two properties the courtyards and the verge that were under contract to be sold as of such date

the million increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of the following i the april equity offering which raised million  net of offering costs  as compared to million  net of offering costs  raised in our october equity offering  ii the pay off of a construction loan with million of proceeds from our october equity offering  iii the million senior secured term loan which was fully funded on june   the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of gmh  iv the contribution of gmh student housing properties in to a joint venture in which we received million in proceeds and retained a equity interest in the joint venture  and v the million increase in proceeds from construction loans used to fund the construction of vista del sol  an owned ace development property  and villas at chestnut ridge  an owned off campus development property  which both opened for occupancy in august these increases were partially offset by the following i the pay off of million in mortgage loan debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of gmh  ii a million increase in distributions to stockholders as a result of our october and april equity offerings and the issuance of common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition of gmh in  iii a million decrease in our construction accounts payable balance as a result of the completion of vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge in august  iv a million decrease in proceeds net of paydowns received from our revolving credit facility  and v a million increase in debt issuance and assumption costs associated with mortgage debt assumed in connection with acquisitions of properties and fees paid to obtain the secured term loan in may structure of owned on campus properties we have entered into two year ground facility leases each with two ten year extensions available with a university system to finance  construct  and manage two student housing facilities 
under the terms of these ground facility leases  the university system owns both the land and improvements  and we make annual minimum rent payments to the university system during the first five years of operation for one property and the first ten years of operation for the other property 
in addition  we pay the university system variable rent payments based upon the operating performance of the properties 
structure of on campus participating properties at our on campus participating properties  the subject universities own both the land and improvements 
we then have a leasehold interest under a ground facility lease 
under the lease  we receive an annual distribution representing of these properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses which includes our management fees  debt service which includes repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
we also manage these properties under multi year management agreements and are paid a management fee representing of receipts 
we do not have access to the cash flows and working capital of these participating properties except for the annual net cash distribution as described above 
additionally  a substantial portion of these properties cash flow is dedicated to capital reserves required under the applicable property indebtedness and to the amortization of such indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties since our interest  including our right to share in the net cash available for distribution from the properties  terminates upon the amortization of their indebtedness 
our economic interest in these properties is therefore limited to our interest in the net cash flow and management and development fees from these properties  as reflected in our calculation of funds from operations modified for the operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom contained herein 
accordingly  when considering these properties contribution to our operations  we focus upon our share of these properties net cash available for distribution and the management fees that we receive from these properties  rather than upon their contribution to our gross revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes 
the following table reflects the amounts related to our on campus participating properties included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and year ended december  revenues direct operating expenses amortization amortization of deferred financing costs ground facility lease net operating income interest income interest expense net income excludes property management fees of million for each of the years ended december    and this expense and the corresponding fee revenue recognized by us have been eliminated in consolidation 
also excludes allocation of expenses related to corporate management and oversight 
represents the universities share of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including payment of principal and capital expenditures 
debt service expenditures for these properties totaled million for each of the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources cash balances and liquidity as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states 
this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the completion of our equity offering in may and the closing of a million secured agency facility in september our may equity offering generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the offering proceeds to paydown the outstanding balance on our secured revolving credit facility and an additional million of cash proceeds to pay off mortgage and construction debt 
in addition  we used these proceeds to fund development costs on our recently completed ace property serving students at arizona state university 
upon closing of our secured agency facility in september  we borrowed million and used million to paydown the outstanding balance on our secured revolving credit facility 
additionally  restricted cash as of december  also included million of funds held in escrow in connection with potential development opportunities 
as of december   our short term liquidity needs included  but were not limited to  the following i anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of per share based on the number of our shares outstanding as of december   ii anticipated distribution payments to our operating partnership unitholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual distribution of per common unit of limited partnership interest common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of on our preferred units of limited partnership interest series a preferred units based on the number of units outstanding as of december   iii payments of approximately million of fixed rate mortgage debt scheduled to mature during the next months  and iv funds for capital improvements at acquired properties and other potential development projects 
as of december   we had million of outstanding variable rate construction debt scheduled to mature in december we expect to extend the maturity date into december by exercising the remaining month extension option available to us 
in august  we amended our existing million revolving credit facility to increase the size of the facility to million  extend the maturity date through august and currently secure the facility with seven of our wholly owned properties 
in september  we closed on a million secured revolving credit facility with freddie mac 
the facility has a five year term and is currently secured by of our wholly owned properties 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements by i borrowing under our existing secured revolving credit facilities discussed above  ii potentially disposing of properties depending on market conditions  and iii utilizing net cash provided by operations 
we may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities and term loan 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
equity offering on may   we completed an equity offering  consisting of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  including  shares issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full at closing 
the offering generated gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate proceeds  net of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering  were approximately million 
secured revolving credit facility in august  the operating partnership renewed its revolving credit facility and increased the size of the facility from million to million 
the facility may be expanded by up to an additional million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the maturity date of the facility is august  and can be extended months through august the facility is currently secured by seven of our wholly owned properties 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an aggregate borrowing base amount equal to the lesser of i to of the value of certain properties  calculated as set forth in the credit facility  and ii the adjusted net operating income from these properties divided by a formula amount 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate  at our option  based upon a base rate or one  two  or three month libor  with a libor floor of  plus  in each case  a spread based upon our total leverage 
additionally  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee of per annum 
in september  we paid off the entire balance on the revolving credit facility using proceeds from the secured agency facility discussed below 
as of december   availability under the facility totaled million 
the terms of the facility include certain restrictions and covenants  which limit  among other items  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  and the disposition of assets 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges and total indebtedness 
we may not pay distributions that exceed a specified percentage of funds from operations  as adjusted  for any four consecutive quarters 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
secured agency facility in september  we closed a million secured revolving credit facility with a freddie mac lender 
the facility has a five year term and is currently secured by properties referred to as the collateral pool 
the facility bears interest at one or three month libor plus a spread that varies based on the debt service ratio of the collateral pool 
additionally  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee of per annum 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the facility totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
the secured agency facility includes certain financial covenants which are the same as are required for the secured revolving credit facility  described above 
senior secured term loan on may   the operating partnership obtained a million senior secured term loan 
the secured term loan has an initial term of months and can be extended through may through the exercise of a month extension period 
the secured term loan bears interest at a variable rate  at our option  based upon a base rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus  in each case  a spread based upon our total leverage 
on june   we borrowed in full from the secured term loan and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the total cash consideration for the gmh acquisition 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the secured term loan was million 
on february   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements effective march  through february   which are both used to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest payments on its libor based senior secured term loan 
under the terms of the two interest rate swap agreements  we pay an average fixed rate of and receive one month libor floating rate 
as a result of these two interest rate swaps  we have effectively fixed the interest rate on our senior secured term loan to as of december  spread 
in the event that the swaps at any time have a negative fair value below a certain threshold level  we could be required to post cash into a collateral account pledged to the interest rate swap providers 
as of december   we had deposited approximately million into a collateral account related to one of the interest rate swaps 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may use borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility to fund distributions 
the board of directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels  including market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements 
on january   we declared a fourth quarter distribution per share of  which was paid on february  to all common stockholders of record as of february  at the same time  the operating partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of common units  as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of series a preferred units 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general capital expenditures and improvements 
our policy is to capitalize costs related to the acquisition  development  rehabilitation  construction  and improvement of properties  including interest and certain internal personnel costs related to the communities under rehabilitation and construction 
capital improvements are costs that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
ordinary repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures represent non incremental building improvements required to maintain current revenues and typically include appliances  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  kitchen bath cabinets  new roofs  site improvements and various exterior building improvements 
non recurring capital expenditures include expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property which were considered necessary to bring the property up to operating standard  and incremental improvements that include  among other items community centers  new windows  and kitchen bath apartment upgrades 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties 
these annual contributions may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred in such year at such properties 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our wholly owned properties are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds total recurring capital expenditures average per bed pre development expenditures our third party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
the closing and or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  and other required governmental permits and authorizations as such  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
historically  our third party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed  however  these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million in pre development costs related to third party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately  million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding net unamortized debt discounts and debt premiums of approximately million and million  respectively  comprised of a million balance on our senior secured term loan  million balance on our secured agency facility  million in mortgage and construction loans secured by our wholly owned properties  million in mortgage loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property  and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was per annum 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt  comprised of our secured agency facility and the vista del sol construction loan discussed below 
wholly owned properties the weighted average interest rate of the million of wholly owned mortgage and construction debt was per annum as of december  each of the mortgage loans is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
each of these mortgages has a year amortization  and none are cross defaulted or cross collateralized to any other indebtedness 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
in august  we completed the final stages of construction on vista del sol  an ace property 
the development and construction of vista del sol was partially financed with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we had the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus 
the interest rate was reduced to libor plus in october upon the satisfaction of certain operations hurdles 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date 
in october  we elected to exercise the first of two extension options available to us  which extended the maturity date to december as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
in august  we completed the final stages of construction on villas at chestnut ridge  an owned off campus property 
the development and construction of villas at chestnut was partially financed with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we had the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus 
the loan required payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings became due on the maturity date 
we extended the term of the loan to august   at which time we paid off the outstanding balance 
on campus participating properties three of our on campus participating properties are financed with million of outstanding project based taxable bonds 
under the terms of these financings  one of our special purpose subsidiaries publicly issued three series of taxable bonds and loaned the proceeds to three special purpose subsidiaries that each hold a separate leasehold interest 
although a default in payment by these special purpose subsidiaries could result in a default under one or more series of bonds  the indebtedness of any of these special purpose subsidiaries is not cross defaulted or cross collateralized with indebtedness of the company  the operating partnership or other special purpose subsidiaries 
repayment of principal and interest on these bonds is insured by mbia  inc the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans are currently encumbered by mortgage loans with balances as of december  of approximately million and million  respectively 
in february  we extended the maturity date of these loans to february the loans bear interest at a rate of libor plus and required payments of interest only through may and monthly payments of principal and interest from may through the maturity date 
in connection with these loan extensions  we terminated the existing interest rate swap agreement on the cullen oaks phase i loan and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement effective february  through february   that is designated to hedge our exposure to fluctuations on interest payments attributed to changes in interest rates associated with payments on the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of per annum and receive a floating rate of libor plus 
pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estate does not achieve financial break even defined as revenues less operating expenses  excluding management fees  less debt service  the applicable lessor would be required to make a rental payment  also known as the contingent payment  sufficient to achieve financial break even 
the contingent payment provision remains in effect until such time as any financing placed on the facilities would receive an investment grade rating without the contingent payment provision 
in the event that the lessor is required to make a contingent payment  future net cash flow distributions would be first applied to repay such contingent payments and then to unpaid management fees prior to normal distributions 
we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
the weighted average interest rate of the indebtedness encumbering our on campus participating properties was at december  off balance sheet items as discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  we hold a equity interest in two unconsolidated joint ventures with mortgage debt outstanding of approximately million as of december  our operating partnership serves as non recourse  carve out guarantor of this debt  which means we are liable to the lender for any loss  damage  cost  expense  liability  claim or other obligation incurred by the lender arising out of or in connection with certain non recourse exceptions in connection with the debt 
pursuant to the limited liability company agreements of the joint ventures  the joint ventures agreed to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the operating partnership with respect to such obligations  except to the extent such obligations were caused by the willful misconduct  gross negligence  fraud or bad faith of the operating partnership or its employees  agents or affiliates 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt operating leases capital leases long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
assumes we do not exercise the extension option available to us on our million vista del sol construction loan  which is more fully discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
includes minimum annual lease payments under the ground facility leases for university village at tu  university centre  vista del sol and barrett honors college 
funds from operations as defined by nareit  ffo represents income loss before allocation to noncontrolling interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net loss attributable to common shareholders year ended december  net loss attributable to common shareholders noncontrolling interests loss from disposition of real estate loss from unconsolidated joint ventures ffo from unconsolidated joint ventures real estate related depreciation and amortization funds from operations ffo ffo per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted represents our share of the ffo from three joint ventures in which we are a noncontrolling partner 
includes the hampton roads military housing joint venture in which we have a minimal economic interest as well as our noncontrolling interest in two joint ventures formed or assumed as part of the company s acquisition of gmh 
during the year ended december   we recorded a compensation charge and related tax impact of approximately million  or per fully diluted share  related to the outperformance bonus plan 
excluding this compensation charge and related tax impact  ffo for the year ended december  would have been million  or per fully diluted share 
for a detailed discussion of the outperformance bonus plan  refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
while our on campus participating properties contributed million  million and million to our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
as noted above  ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets because these gaap items assume that the value of real estate diminishes over time 
however  unlike the ownership of our owned off campus properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating measure of the properties  a measure referred to herein as ffom 
funds from operations modified ffom year ended december  funds from operations elimination of operations of on campus participating properties and unconsolidated joint venture net income from on campus participating properties amortization of investment in on campus participating properties ffo from hampton roads unconsolidated joint venture modifications to reflect operational performance of on campus participating properties our share of net cash flow management fees impact of on campus participating properties elimination of our share of impairment charges recorded for unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations modified ffom ffom per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted our share of the ffo from the hampton roads military housing unconsolidated joint venture is excluded from the calculation of the ffom  as management believes this amount does not accurately reflect the company s participation in the economics of this transaction 
of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods and amounts accrued for the interim periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
represents our share of impairment charges recorded in the third quarter for two properties owned through our unconsolidated fidelity joint ventures 
during the year ended december   we recorded a compensation charge and related tax impact of approximately million  or per fully diluted share  related to the outperformance bonus plan 
excluding this compensation charge and related tax impact  ffom for the year ended december  would have been million  or per fully diluted share 
for a detailed discussion of the outperformance bonus plan  refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the unique contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is different from that of our off campus owned properties 
additionally  ffom reflects features of our ownership interests in our on campus participating properties that are unique to us 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate a ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using our modified ffo only supplementally 
inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions  developments and maturing debt 
these borrowings expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  and we had fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively excluding net unamortized debt discounts and debt premiums 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates basis points would cause a million and million decline in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would cause a million and million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
due to the structure of our floating rate debt and interest rate protection instruments  the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on our net income to common stockholders and cash flows would not be significant at december  or all of our outstanding indebtedness is effectively fixed rate except for our secured revolving credit facilities and our vista del sol construction loan 
our secured agency facility had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at one or three month libor plus a spread that varies based on the debt service ratio of the collateral pool 
the vista del sol construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
we have in place two million interest rate swap agreements  designated as cash flow hedges  which effectively fix the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the senior secured term loan at through maturity in may in addition  we have in place an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a cash flow hedge  which effectively fixes the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii mortgage loans at through maturity in we anticipate incurring additional variable rate indebtedness in the future  including draws under our secured revolving credit facilities 
we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
