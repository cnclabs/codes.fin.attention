in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors  the introductory paragraph to part i  and elsewhere in this form k

asc strategy 
we measure the success of our asc strategy based on our ability to achieve or exceed the following key objectives acquire and develop new ascs 
we consider the acquisition and development of new ascs a key element of our long term growth strategy 
we currently have a development staff dedicated to identifying and analyzing acquisition and development opportunities 
strengthen and build relationships with existing and new physician partners 
our physician partners play a significant role in the success of our ascs 
we share a common goal with our physician partners which is to operate efficient  productive and profitable ascs 
our objective is to own more than of each asc but less than  however  in certain instances we may consider owning a noncontrolling interest 
continue to increase revenue and improve operating margins in our existing ascs 
the primary source of revenue at our ascs is derived from surgical procedures performed 
profitable growth within our existing ascs is determined by our ability to maximize efficiency and utilization  expand into medical procedures beyond eye care  and provide quality service to our physicians and their patients 
in addition to the above key asc objectives  our overall strategy also includes maintaining a strong balance sheet  continuing to grow the other segments of our business  and attracting and retaining employees to help us achieve our growth objectives 
uncertainties entering the continuing challenges presented by the economy may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
the current state of the economy  including higher unemployment levels  could result in fewer procedures being performed at our ascs because patients may delay or cancel treatments 
further increases in unemployment could also result in fewer individuals being covered by employer sponsored health plans and more individuals being covered by lower paying government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid 
adverse economic conditions may also increase pressure on federal and state governments to contain or reduce reimbursements from medicare  medicaid and other programs 
to the extent that commercial payors are adversely affected by the economy  we may experience declines in commercial rates  a slow down in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect 
intangible assets  primarily in the form of goodwill  represent a significant portion of our total assets 
at december   intangible assets represented approximately of total assets and of novamed  inc stockholders equity 
the intangible asset value represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions and affiliations 
the value of these assets may not be realized 
we regularly  and at least annually  evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate all or a portion of the carrying amount of the assets of each of our reporting units may exceed fair value  in which case an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary 
during  our estimate of the fair value of the assets of some of our reporting units declined 
this was due to a combination of operating performance as well as a decline in market multiples 
while it was not necessary to record an impairment charge in  a further decline in operating performance and or market multiples could negatively impact the fair value of our intangible assets 
this could lead us to determine that our intangible assets have suffered an impairment that requires us to write off a portion of the asset 
such a write off could significantly reduce our total assets  result in a substantial non cash charge to earnings  and cause us to be in default under one or more covenants in our credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  net of allowances 
revenue from surgical procedures performed at our surgical facilities and patient visits to our eye care practices  net of contractual allowances and a provision for doubtful accounts  is recognized at the time the service is performed 
the contractual allowance is the difference between the fee we charge and the amount we expect to be paid by the patient or the applicable third party payor  which includes medicare and private insurance 
we base our estimates for the contractual allowance on the medicare reimbursement rates when medicare is the payor  our contracted rate with other third party payors or our historical experience when we do not have a specific medicare or contracted rate 
we base our estimate for doubtful accounts on the aging category and our historical collection experience 
while we believe that our contractual allowances are appropriate  if our actual contractual adjustments or bad debts differ from our estimates  our results of operations may be affected 
during the years ended december   and  we had no significant adjustments to contractual allowances related to prior periods 
our optical products purchasing organization negotiates buying discounts with optical product manufacturers 
the buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing organization represent the revenue recognized 
product sales revenue from our optical laboratories and marketing products and services businesses  net of an allowance for returns and discounts  is recognized when the product is shipped or service is provided to the customer 
we base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return activity and discounts given 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the reserves for estimated contractual allowances and doubtful accounts noted above 
prior to  we recorded an estimated contractual allowance for each procedure performed in our surgical facilities based on the difference between the fee we charged for the procedure and what we expected to be paid 
this resulted in a large contractual allowance balance recorded on our balance sheet 
in july  we began the implementation of a new process whereby our billing system automatically adjusts for the difference between our fee and the amount we expect to be paid and no contractual allowance is recorded 
this new process is being implemented over time at most of our surgical facilities and will apply to most  but not all  of the surgical procedures performed and charges entered 
as a result of this new process our contractual allowance balance decreased significantly in and is expected to decrease further in however  this new process did not and will not impact net revenue or net accounts receivable which have always been reported net of the contractual allowance 
asset impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other noncurrent assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
our reported goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present 
accounting standards require that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill  to determine if an impairment exists 
we have one operating segment within our surgical facilities reportable segment 
for impairment testing purposes  each of the our ascs qualify as components of that operating segment 
because the ascs have similar economic characteristics  the components are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
we have five other reporting units that are included within our product sales and other reportable segments 
these include our optical laboratory business  optical products purchasing organization  call center and marketing solutions business  optometric practice and ophthalmology practice 
in conducting our impairment analysis  we utilize a market comparable and discounted cash flow approach 
differences in assumptions used under this approach could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
we currently believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of our goodwill based on assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
however  the analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
we will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
we calculate fair value by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the option 
we also estimate the expected service period over which our stock based awards will vest

in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due june  the convertible notes 
proceeds from the convertible notes were used to pay down million of outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and to fund the million net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions described below 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing december  the convertible notes rank subordinate to our senior debt and rank pari passu or senior to all of our other subordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  or approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes 
at december   we had million in convertible subordinated debt outstanding  net of debt discount 
as of december   the fair value of the million convertible notes was approximately million  based on the level valuation hierarchy under asc formerly sfas no 

effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard included in asc formerly fsp apb 
asc applies to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  when the conversion option does not need to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument in accordance with asc formerly fas 
asc requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that  upon conversion  may be settled fully or partially in cash  must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
additionally  debt issuance costs are required to be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the liability and equity components and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively 
asc requires retrospective application and  accordingly  the prior periods financial statements included herein have been adjusted 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  we determined that the fair value of our convertible notes at issuance in was approximately million  and we designated the residual value of approximately million as the equity component 
additionally  we allocated approximately million of the million original convertible notes issuance cost as debt issuance cost and the remaining million as equity issuance cost 
the adoption of asc added approximately million  million and million of non cash interest expense to our  and results of operations  respectively 
this resulted in a reduction to net income of approximately million per diluted share  million per diluted share and million per diluted share in  and  respectively 
the adoption of asc will add approximately million of non cash interest expense to our results of operations and will reduce net income by approximately million per diluted share 
the adoption of asc does not have an impact on our cash flows 
the convertible notes include a net share settlement feature that requires us to settle conversion of the notes in cash up to the notes principal amount and settle any excess of the convertible notes conversion value above their principal amount by delivering shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of cash and common stock  at our option 
the conversion value of the convertible notes is equal to the market price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes 
a market price that exceeds the conversion price of at the time of settlement results in excess conversion value above the original principal amount of  as a result of the net share settlement feature  we will be able to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock issuable in the event of the conversion of the convertible notes by repaying principal in cash instead of issuing shares of common stock for that amount 
additionally  we will not be required to include the underlying shares of common stock in the calculation of our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for earnings per share until our common stock price exceeds 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with respect to our common stock the purchased call options with deutsche bank ag london the counterparty  an affiliate of the underwriter 
the purchased call options cover an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the cost of the call options totaled million 
in connection with the cost of the call options  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million to additional paid in capital to reflect the future cash benefit of the deduction over the term of the convertible notes 
we also sold warrants to the counterparty to purchase from us an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and received proceeds of million 
taken together  the call option and warrant agreements have the effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to per share 
for a further discussion of the convertible notes and the related call options and warrants  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective august   we amended our credit facility  decreasing the maximum commitment available under the facility from million to million  consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility 
the expiration date of the credit facility was extended to december   however  if we repay or refinance our convertible notes prior to this date  the expiration date will be extended to august  the maximum commitment available under the revolving credit facility is million or the maximum allowed under the calculated ratio limitations 
the million term loan facility requires quarterly repayments of million commencing december   increasing to million and million commencing december  and december   respectively 
the amended credit agreement also includes an option allowing us to increase the maximum commitment available under the revolving credit facility to million under certain conditions 
at december   we had approximately million of potential borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at an annual rate equal to our lender s published base rate plus the applicable borrowing margin ranging from to or libor plus a range from to  varying depending upon the calculated ratios and our ability to meet other financial covenants 
in addition  a fee ranging from to is charged on the unused portion of the revolver commitment 
the maximum borrowing availability and applicable interest rates under the credit facility are calculated based on a ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  all as more fully defined in our credit agreement 
the credit agreement continues to contain customary covenants that include limitations on indebtedness  liens  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and share repurchases  as well as restrictions on the payment of dividends  however  many of these limitations were changed by the amendment 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we were subject to a maximum total leverage ratio of times initially  which decreased to times for the quarter ending december  and will decrease to times for the quarter ending december  and times for the quarter ending december  and thereafter 
we are also subject to a maximum senior leverage ratio of times initially  which will decrease to times for the quarter ending december  and thereafter 
we are required to obtain the consent of our lenders for any acquisition exceeding million individually and million for all acquisitions consummated during the term of the credit agreement 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility with a weighted average interest rate of and were in compliance with all of our covenants 
the weighted average interest rate on credit line borrowings during was

during  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps protected us against certain interest rate fluctuations of the libor rate on million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the date of the first interest rate swap was april   and it expired on april  this interest rate swap effectively fixed our libor rate on million of variable rate debt at a rate of

the new albany asc entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the libor rate on this debt at as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was restricted pursuant to agreements with six of our ascs 
as of december  and  we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
we expect our cash flow from operations to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the size and timing of our acquisition and expansion activities  capital requirements associated with our businesses  and the future cost of equipment 
during the first quarter of  we recorded additional goodwill of million for one of our ascs relating to the resolution of a contingency included in the original purchase agreement

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting 
this standard represents the last numbered standard issued by the fasb under the old pre codification numbering system  and amends the gaap hierarchy 
on july   fasb launched fasb s new codification ie the accounting standards codification asc 
the codification supersedes existing gaap for nongovernmental entities 
we have revised our financial statement disclosures in compliance with the new codification system 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard included in asc  debt with conversion and other options  formerly fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
asc applies to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  when the conversion option does not need to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument in accordance with other literature 
asc requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that  upon conversion  may be settled fully or partially in cash  must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
additionally  debt issuance costs are required to be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the liability and equity components and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively 
asc requires retrospective application and  accordingly  the prior periods financial statements included herein have been adjusted 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  we determined that the fair value of its convertible notes at issuance in was approximately million  and designated the residual value of approximately million as the equity component 
additionally  we allocated approximately million of the million original convertible notes issuance cost as debt issuance cost and the remaining million as equity issuance cost 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard included in asc  consolidation  formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
asc establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries 
this standard defines a noncontrolling interest  previously called a minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
asc requires  among other items  that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity separate from the parent s equity  consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of operations  and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value 
we applied the provisions of asc retrospectively 
as a result  noncontrolling interests of million were reclassified from the mezzanine section to equity in the december  balance sheet 
the adoption of asc also results in the cash flow impact of certain transactions with noncontrolling interests being classified within financing activities 
such treatment is consistent with the view that under asc certain transactions between us or our subsidiaries and noncontrolling interests are considered to be equity transactions 
as a result  distributions to noncontrolling interests of million and million have been reclassified to the financing section of our consolidated statement of cash flows for and  respectively
