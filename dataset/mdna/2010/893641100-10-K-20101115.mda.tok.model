item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and td group s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the heading entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we believe we are a leading global designer  producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today 
our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 
some of our more significant product offerings  substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end users in the aerospace industry  include mechanical electro mechanical actuators and controls  ignition systems and engine technology  specialized pumps and valves  power conditioning devices  specialized ac dc electric motors and generators  aircraft audio systems  specialized cockpit displays  engineered latching and locking devices  specialized lavatory components  engineered connectors and elastomers  rods and locking devices  nicad batteries chargers  and lighting and control technology 
each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 
long term sustainable growth for fiscal year  we generated net sales of million  gross profit of million or of sales  and net income of million 
we believe we have achieved steady  long term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value driven operating strategy 
more specifically  focusing our businesses on our value driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business  carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 
our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business 
the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 
our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

table of contents we believe our key competitive strengths include large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream 
we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products 
we estimate that our products are installed on more than  commercial transport  regional transport  military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 
diversified revenue base 
we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product  platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance 
our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production 
significant barriers to entry 
we believe that the niche nature of our markets  the industry s stringent regulatory and customer certification requirements  the relatively low unit cost as compared to many other highly engineered aerospace products and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create significant practical barriers to entry for potential competitors 
our business strategy is made up of two key elements a value driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and a selective acquisition strategy 
value driven operating strategy 
our three core value drivers are obtaining profitable new business 
we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise  application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate 
we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth 
improving our cost structure 
we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure  with a focus on reducing the cost of each 
providing highly engineered value added products to customers 
we focus on the engineering  manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers 
we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products 
this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so 
selective acquisition strategy 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value driven operating strategies 
the aerospace industry  in particular  remains highly fragmented  with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non core operations of larger businesses 
we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture 
as of the date of this report  we have successfully acquired and integrated businesses and or product lines since our formation in many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility  which enables a higher production capacity utilization  which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume

trend information we predominantly serve customers in the commercial  regional  business jet and general aviation aftermarket  which accounts for approximately of total sales  the commercial aerospace oem market  comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers  which accounts for approximately of total sales  and the defense market  which accounts for approximately of total sales 
non aerospace sales comprise approximately of our total sales 
the commercial aerospace industry  including the aftermarket and oem market  is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles  or rpms  between and  as well as increases in oem production and backlog  however  the recent global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly in in  the commercial aerospace industry has slightly rebounded with increases in rpms  as well the large commercial oem sector aircraft with or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned 
table of contents increases in production 
the leading indicators and industry consensus suggest that conditions in the commercial transport market sector are likely to improve  including a return to rpm growth and a modest acceleration of capacity growth 
the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 
our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk 
we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry  and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft  which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform 
at times  declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another 
however  due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers  variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 
there are many short term factors including inventory corrections  unannounced changes in order patterns  strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause short term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter to quarter  as well as variations in product mix from quarter to quarter  that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems 
again  in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 
commercial aftermarket the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft 
although rpms increased annually between and  had negative growth as a result of the expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy 
current industry consensus indicates that rpms is stabilizing and will return to positive growth thereafter 
commercial oem market there is industry consensus that conditions in the commercial transport market sector have improved recently 
we are expecting increased activity in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas furthermore  the business jet oem market significantly declined in and and is expected to bottom out in the near future 
this market has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth  corporate profits  commodity prices and stock market returns across the world 
defense in recent years  defense spending has reached historic highs  due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
our military business fluctuates from year to year  and is dependent  to a degree  on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could be flat to modestly down in future years over the current high levels 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment 
substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm  fixed price purchase orders received from customers 
provisions for returns  uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified  as appropriate  by the most current information available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances  however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness 
the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers 
management s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management 
if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate  management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products 
the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company s operations  generally ranging from days to six years 
in addition  certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions 
the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources 
the company also provides a general amount based on historical results 
historically  actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first in  first out fifo methods for all locations except cef  which determines the cost of inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in service for or more years  it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  past usage and future sales forecasts 
although management believes that the company s estimates of obsolete and slow moving inventory are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 
intangible assets mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
fair value adjustments to the 
table of contents company s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition 
we generally use third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data 
the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required 
intangible assets  such as goodwill  trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
gaap requires that the annual  and any interim  impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level 
the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company 
substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction  and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment 
with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary  any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 
stock options the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options vesting periods 
compensation expense is recorded over the service period using the straight line method for service based awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance based awards 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company  including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands fiscal years ended september  of sales of sales of sales net sales cost of sales selling and administrative amortization of intangibles income from operations interest expense  net income tax provision net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales of million resulted from the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation  acme 
table of contents and the woodward hrt product line in fiscal as well as the recent acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco in fiscal sales excluding acquisitions declined by million  or  from the prior year 
the decline in organic sales was primarily due to a decrease of million of commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the business jet oem s significant production rate reductions and related inventory reductions resulting from the impact of the global economic conditions 
partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial oem sales was i an increase of million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic  and ii an increase of million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem products across most of our product lines 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales discussed above 
in addition  the increase was partially attributable to higher costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into td group s operations and purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the dollar amount of gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items sales of million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately million in fiscal  which includes the acquisition related costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions 
these acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal by approximately percentage points 
favorable product mix  favorable product pricing on our proprietary products and cost reduction efforts partially offset by the negative impact of fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume excluding acquisitions 
the net impact of these items resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million in fiscal despite the decline in organic sales of million discussed above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million  of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately million  transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of dukes aerospace and semco instruments of approximately million  higher research and development expenses primarily relating to airbus a and a platforms more than offsetting declines in expenses on the boeing  new business development expenses and higher professional fees 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net increase of million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months partially offset by the order backlog becoming fully amortized in fiscal relating to prior acquisitions 
income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 
interest expense net 
interest expense net increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  comprising an increase in interest expense of million and a decrease in interest income of million 
interest expense increased primarily due to interest expense of approximately million attributable to the million of senior subordinated notes due issued 
table of contents in october partially offsetting the increase was lower interest rates on the company s existing floating rate borrowings under its senior secured credit facility 
the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately billion for fiscal and approximately billion for fiscal the average interest rate on total debt was approximately for fiscal and fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest income was lower primarily due to lower interest rates on our invested cash balances 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reductions in estimated state tax obligations and domestic tax credits 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 
earnings per share 
the basic and diluted earnings per share  calculated under the two class method  was per share for fiscal and per share for fiscal due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal  the net income for fiscal of million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of million approximately per share resulting in a net income applicable to common stockholders of million 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales of million resulted from the acquisitions of cef and the unison product line in fiscal as well as the recent acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation  acme and the woodward hrt product line 
sales excluding acquisitions declined by million  or  from the prior year 
the net decline in organic sales was primarily due to i a decrease of million of commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the impact of the significant decline in production rates in the business jet market resulting from the continued impact of global economic conditions negatively impacting the business jet market and a reduction in sales to the boeing company due to its employee strike  ii a decrease of million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the impact of the global economic downturn resulting in a decline in worldwide airline traffic and business jet activity  and iii an increase of million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem and aftermarket spare parts and repairs across most of our product lines 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above and higher acquisition related costs of million  partially offset by the cost savings from the work force reductions discussed below 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the dollar amount of gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items sales of million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately million in fiscal  which includes the acquisition related costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions 
these acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal by approximately percentage points 
reductions in manufacturing workforce of approximately which occurred from mid calendar year throughout calendar year these reductions in manufacturing workforce were in response to an anticipated drop in overall commercial aerospace market sales 
these workforce reductions resulted in cost savings which increased gross profit by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents favorable product mix  meaning that the lower margin oem product sales dropped more than the higher margin aftermarket product sales  favorable product pricing on our proprietary products and other cost reduction efforts partially offset by the impact of fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume excluding acquisitions 
these factors resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million in fiscal despite the decrease in organic sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased by million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the recent acquisitions discussed above 
income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 
interest expense net 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a reduction in interest income of million 
the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately billion during both fiscal and year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately during fiscal from for the comparable period last year 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the research and development tax credit 
net income 
net income increased million  or to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 
earnings per share 
the basic and diluted earnings per share  calculated under the two class method  was per share for fiscal and per share for fiscal backlog as of september   the company estimated its sales order backlog at million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of million as of september  the increase in backlog is due to the acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco  discussed above  totaling approximately million and an increase in orders across existing product lines in both oem and aftermarket channels  reflecting the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic 
the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months 
purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment 
the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  the company s backlog as of september  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 
foreign operations although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states  we manufacture some products in malaysia through our wholly owned malaysian subsidiary and some products in mexico through a maquiladora relationship with a third party 
we sell our products in the united states  as well as in foreign countries 
substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and  therefore  we have no material 
table of contents exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales 
in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers  including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary  are not material  with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 
our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
inflation many of the company s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in changing operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s businesses during the fiscal years  and were not significant 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing 
we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions 
we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and or through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 
we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business 
the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage  taking into consideration the company s debt holders  equity holders  credit ratings  acquisition opportunities and other factors 
the company s debt leverage ratio  which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelve month period  has varied widely during the company s history  ranging from approximately to our debt leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately notwithstanding the definitive agreement to acquire mckechnie aerospace holdings  inc described below  the company has not  at this time  determined to change the nature of its debt facilities 
however  in the future  the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions  if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends 
our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 
we note that our senior secured credit facility matures in june and our senior secured notes under our indentures mature in july as always  we are evaluating our options with respect to the maturity of such indebtedness 
notwithstanding the definitive agreement to acquire mckechnie aerospace holdings  inc described below  our current plan is to refinance a significant portion of our long term debt upon maturity or prior to that time if the conditions of the credit markets become more favorable 
on september   transdigm entered into a definitive agreement with mckechnie holdings llc to purchase all of the outstanding stock of mckechnie  for a total purchase price on a cash free  debt free basis of approximately  million in cash 
the purchase agreement contains representations  warranties  covenants and conditions that we believe are customary for a transaction of this size and type  as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations 
the closing of the mckechnie acquisition  which is expected before 
table of contents the end of the calendar year  is subject to several conditions  including receipt of required regulatory approvals  and there can be no assurance that the mckechnie acquisition will be consummated as contemplated  or at all 
we intend to finance the mckechnie acquisition and concurrently refinance a portion of our existing indebtedness through a combination of senior subordinated notes and borrowings under a new senior secured credit facility 
if we consummate the mckechnie acquisition  we expect to add approximately  million of indebtedness 
operating activities 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities on net income of million during fiscal compared to million of cash from operating activities generated on net income of million during fiscal the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million generated during fiscal the increase of million in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in net income of million partially offset by the payout of the deferred compensation liability of and the change in income taxes receivable including the impact of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting primarily of the acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco for a total of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal also includes cash proceeds of million from the sale of real estate no longer utilized that was acquired in a previous acquisition 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting primarily of the acquisitions of the businesses of aircraft parts corporation  acme and woodward hrt product lines for a total of million and capital expenditures of million

transdigm inc will not be required to prepay any of the term loans if the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than to or if the term loans achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year 
excess cash flow is a negotiated definition generally designed to capture the cash that was generated by our business in excess of cash used in the business 
consolidated leverage ratio means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of ebitda as defined  calculated on a pro forma basis 
transdigm s consolidated leverage ratio was approximately to at september   thus the company was not obligated to make a prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision

the revolving loan facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in june the senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by td group and all of transdigm inc s current domestic restricted subsidiaries  and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing property and assets of transdigm inc and all of transdigm inc s existing domestic restricted subsidiaries  and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of transdigm inc and transdigm inc

the alternate base rate is the greater of credit suisse s prime rate or basis points over the weighted average rates on overnight federal funds as published by the federal reserve bank of new york 
the adjusted libo rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in the london interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the board of governors of the united states federal reserve 
the applicable margin percentage is a percentage per annum equal to for alternate base rate term loans  for adjusted libo rate term loans  in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted libo rate revolving loans  a percentage which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of transdigm inc as of the relevant date of determination

as a result of the acquisition of ati  transdigm inc issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes under the indenture dated as of june  in october  transdigm issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes at an issue price of of the principal amount thereof 
the terms of the senior subordinated notes issued in october are substantially identical to the terms of the senior subordinated notes that were issued and sold by transdigm in june and february 
table of contents the proceeds from the issuance of the new senior subordinated notes  after the original issue discount  were used to make a cash distribution to td group  which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately million  made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately million and paid for transaction related fees and expenses 
such notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in july the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally and on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  by td group and all of our existing domestic subsidiaries 
certain restrictive covenants in our debt documents both the senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  liens and encumbrances  and prepayments of other indebtedness 
in addition  the revolving loan facility under the senior secured credit facility requires transdigm inc to comply with a first lien leverage ratio 
a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 
if any such default occurs  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder  to be immediately due and payable 
the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 
in addition  following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility  the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt  which includes our available cash  and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes 
if the mckechnie acquisition is consummated  we anticipate that we will incur additional indebtedness  which will be subject to similar covenants and agreements 
stock repurchase program in october we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed million in the aggregate 
during  a total of  shares were repurchased under this program at an aggregate cost of approximately million

contractual obligations the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of september  in millions and thereafter total senior secured credit facility senior subordinated notes due scheduled interest payments operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the senior secured credit facility will mature on june  and will not be subject to interim scheduled amortization 
assumes that the variable interest rate on our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility remains constant at 

table of contents in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  the company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and  from time to time  for facility expansion 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million during fiscal   and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal to be between million and million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 
the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company s business direction 
the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition 
the company s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions  total interest expense will increase 
if the company has excess cash  it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend  prepayment of indebtedness  repurchase of stock  or other means 
in october  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million  in the aggregate  of the company s common stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased a total of  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
the company did not repurchase any shares under the program in whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
in addition  the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 
the company s ability to make scheduled interest payments on  or to refinance  the company s indebtedness  or to fund non acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on the company s ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  research and development efforts and long term indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs 
the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity 
also  to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans  consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses  the company may also need to raise additional capital 
in particular  increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the mckechnie acquisition is consummated  we anticipate that we will incur additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition and to refinance existing indebtedness
