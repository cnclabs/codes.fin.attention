item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company risks if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls and if we fail to remediate existing internal control deficiencies  our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired  which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results  our ability to operate our business and our stock price 
in connection with the internal investigation conducted by the audit committee into revenue recognition of certain transactions in our medical line of business  we determined that we did not have adequate internal financial and accounting controls to produce accurate and timely financial statements 
among the material weaknesses identified in our review  we determined that we had material weaknesses with respect to revenue recognition 
in addition  as set forth in  we determined that we had a material weakness in controls over accounting for income taxes 
in reviewing our financial statements in preparation for the restatement we determined that we also had material weaknesses in our controls over accounting for stock based compensation  the adoption of new accounting standards  inventory control management and accounting for fixed assets 
for a further discussion of these material weaknesses  see item a of this report 
although we have begun implementing new processes and procedures to improve our internal controls  our interim chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer determined that as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
any failure on our part to remedy identified material weaknesses  or any additional delays or errors in our financial reporting  whether or not resulting from the identified material weakness relating to revenue recognition or any other material weaknesses  could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our company will have been detected 
as discussed in this form k  management has identified material weaknesses in the past and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future 

table of contents we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have expended significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our management has concluded that we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting as of december  based on the criteria in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken and are taking to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient or that we will be able to implement our planned processes and procedures in a timely manner 
in addition  we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis 
any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth 
our current litigation is expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  and will continue to be  until resolved  and regardless of whether we are ultimately successful  could adversely affect our business 
we are currently a party to various legal proceedings 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict how these cases will ultimately be resolved 
in addition  it is possible that as a result of our internal investigation described elsewhere in this report  we may be subject to additional litigation and investigations by government authorities such as the sec 
we anticipate that currently pending litigation will continue to be costly and that future litigation or investigations will result in additional legal expenses  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful or able to recover the costs we incur in connection with litigation or investigations 
we expense litigation and investigatory costs as incurred  and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
litigation and investigations have diverted  and are likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved or concluded  litigation and investigations could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
for additional background on this and our other litigation  please see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part i and item legal proceedings of this part i 
the uncertain global economic environment could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current global economic recession could materially hurt our business in a number of ways including  longer sales and renewal cycles  delays in adoption of our products or technologies  increased risk of competition  increased risk of inventory obsolescence  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  delays in signing or failing to sign customer agreements  or signing customer agreements at reduced purchase levels 
in addition  our suppliers  customers  potential customers  and business partners are facing similar challenges  which could materially and adversely affect the level of business they conduct with us or in the level of sales of products that include our technology 
the current economic downturn may lead to a reduction in corporate  university  or government budgets for research and development in sectors including the automotive  aerospace  mobility  and medical sectors  which use our products 
sales of our products or technology may be adversely affected by cuts in these research and development budgets 
furthermore  a prolonged tightening of the credit markets could significantly impact our ability to liquidate investments or reduce the rate of return on investments 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  expect to experience losses in the future  and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
since  we have incurred losses in all but four quarters 
we need to generate significant ongoing revenue to return to profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur expenses as we continue to develop our technologies  increase our sales and marketing efforts  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled technologies and products and change our business  protect and enforce our intellectual property  
table of contents pursue strategic relationships  incur costs related to pending litigation  acquire intellectual property or other assets from third parties  and invest in systems and processes to manage our business 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have little or no control or influence on our licensees design  manufacturing  promotion  distribution  or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees  nor can we control consolidation within an industry which could either reduce the number of licensing products available or reduce royalty rates for the combined licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technologies in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance  or otherwise generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
if our licensees products fail to achieve commercial success or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the video console gaming and computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty and license revenue 
due to recent turnover  our executive management team has limited experience working together and if there are difficulties within this team  it could impede the execution of our business strategy 
recently  we have experienced a number of changes in our executive team 
our success will depend to a significant extent on the management team s ability to implement a successful strategy  to successfully lead and motivate our employees  and to work effectively together and with the board of directors 
if this leadership team is not successful  our ability to execute our business strategy would be impeded 
we have experienced significant change in our business  and we cannot assure you that these changes will result in increased revenue or profitability 
our business has undergone significant changes in recent periods  including the divestiture of our d business  new management  consolidation of our medical business and personnel changes and focus on additional target markets 
in addition  we recently announced our intention to transition from the medical simulation products business 
these changes have required  and will likely in the future require  significant investments of cash and other resources  as well as management s time and attention and have placed significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering  or other resources 
we cannot assure you that these efforts will result in growing our business successfully or in increased operating performance 

table of contents we may not be able to continue to derive significant revenues from makers of peripherals for popular video gaming platforms 
a significant portion of our gaming royalty revenues come from third party peripheral makers who make licensed gaming products designed for use with popular video game console systems from microsoft  sony  and nintendo 
video game console systems are closed  proprietary systems  and video game console system makers typically impose certain requirements or restrictions on third party peripheral makers who wish to make peripherals that will be compatible with a particular video game console system 
if third party peripheral makers cannot or are not allowed to obtain or satisfy these requirements or restrictions  our gaming royalty revenues could be significantly reduced 
furthermore  should a significant video game console maker choose to omit touch enabling capabilities from its console system or somehow restrict or impede the ability of third parties to make touch enabling peripherals  it may very well lead our gaming licensees to stop making products with touch enabling capabilities  thereby significantly reducing our gaming royalty revenues 
under the terms of our agreement with sony  sony receives a royalty free license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits sony to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services covered by our patents in its ps  ps  and ps systems for a fixed license payment 
the ps console system was launched in late in the united states and japan without force feedback capability 
sony has since released new ps controllers with vibration feedback 
we do not know to what extent sony will allow third party peripheral makers to make licensed ps gaming products with vibration feedback to interface with the ps console 
to the extent sony selectively limits their licensing to leading third party controller makers to make ps controllers with vibration feedback  our licensing revenue from third party ps peripherals will continue to be severely limited 
sony continues to sell the ps  and our third party licensees continue to sell licensed ps peripherals 
however  us sales of ps peripherals continue to decline as more consumers switch to the ps console system and other next generation console systems like the nintendo wii and microsoft xbox both the microsoft xbox and nintendo wii include touch enabling capabilities 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce peripherals for its xbox game console 
to the extent microsoft does not fully license third parties  microsoft s share of all aftermarket xbox game controller sales will likely remain high or increase  which we expect will limit our gaming royalty revenue 
additionally  microsoft is now making touch enabled steering wheel products covered by their royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents that could compete with our licensees current products for which we earn per unit royalties 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets has declined and may further do so if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled gaming products and consumer products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services  excluding specified products  covered by our patents 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled console gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as mobile phones  pdas  and portable music players 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than some of our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments might decline 
we generate revenues from touch enabling components that are sold and incorporated into third party products 
we have little or no control or influence over the design  manufacture  promotion  distribution  or pricing of those third party products 
part of our business strategy is to sell components that provide touch feedback capability in products that other companies design  manufacture  and sell 
sales of these components generate product revenue 
however  we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are 
table of contents manufactured and sold by those customers that buy these components 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from customers that they will continue to use our components in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our components may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  or achieve commercial acceptance 
if the customers fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for their products that include our components  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and we expect to continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights under our technology and intellectual property 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
we refer to the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including  but not limited to  field of use definitions  market sector  and product category definitions  collectively as license provisions 
due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories  and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different from our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to claims that we have granted rights to one licensee which are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee 
in addition  after we enter into an agreement  it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that we did not foresee or was not foreseeable at the time we entered into the agreement 
as a result  in any agreement  we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technologies  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new or renewal of licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding  and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  the competition we may face with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  difficulties with persuading potential licensees who may have developed their own intellectual property or licensed intellectual property from other parties in areas related to ours to license our technology versus continuing to develop their own or license from other parties  challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies in new applications like mobile phones  portable devices  and touchscreens  difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs and risks necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  difficulties in obtaining new licensees for yet to be commercialized technology because their suppliers may not be ready to meet stringent quality and parts availability requirements  inability to sign new gaming licenses if the video console makers choose not to license third parties to make peripherals for their new consoles  and 
table of contents reluctance of content developers  mobile phone manufacturers  and service providers to sign license agreements without a critical mass of other such inter dependent supporters of the mobile phone industry also having a license  or without enough phones in the market that incorporate our technologies 
our consolidation of and transition from our medical operations and other restructurings may not be successful  and may negatively impact our business 
in may  we moved the operations of our medical line of business from maryland to our headquarters in san jose  california and we have also reduced our workforce in recent periods 
consolidations and business restructurings involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the potential loss of key employees  customers and business partners  market uncertainty related to our future business plans  the incurrence of unexpected expenses or charges  diversion of management attention from other key areas of our business  negative impacts on employee morale  and other potential dislocations and disruptions to the business 
in addition  if our business expands  it may be more difficult for us to attract additional personnel and develop the resources we would need to support a larger customer base 
we also intend to transition from our medical simulation products business which could continue to disrupt our overall business 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were from our medical line of business 
accordingly  if we are unable to manage this consolidation and transition effectively  our overall business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  has caused us to expend  and may cause us to expend in future periods  significant financial resources as well as divert management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming  and difficult to pursue in certain venues  and distracting to management and potential customers and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technologies  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we could be enjoined from the continued use of the technologies at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed  and we may not be able to develop non infringing technologies or license the infringed or similar technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses could increase and our revenues could decrease 
while we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees may receive similar letters from these or other companies from time to time 
such letters or subsequent litigation may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  such letters may cause a dispute between our licensees and us over indemnification for the infringement claim 
any of these notices  or additional notices that we or our licensees could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation against us  either regarding the infringement claim or the indemnification claim 

table of contents we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technologies and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against our licensees  or us  whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technologies unless we can enter into licensing agreements 
licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims by third parties against our licensees could also result in claims by our licensees against us for indemnification 
the legal principles applicable to patents and patent licenses continue to change and evolve 
legislation and judicial decisions that make it easier for patent licensees to challenge the validity  enforceability  or infringement of patents  or make it more difficult for patent licensors to obtain a permanent injunction  obtain enhanced damages for willful infringement  or to obtain or enforce patents  may adversely affect our business and the value of our patent portfolio 
furthermore  our prospects for future revenue growth through our royalty and licensing based businesses could be diminished 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
our products or our licensees products may have flaws or other defects that may lead to personal or other injury claims 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  property injury  financial loss  or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
although we intend to transition from the medical products business  we could face product liability claims for products that we have sold or that any successor may sell in the future 
defending any claims against us  regardless of merit  would be time consuming  expensive to defend  and distracting to management  and could result in damages and injure our reputation  the reputation of our technology and services  and or the reputation of our products  or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels  or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we could face such claims in the future  which could harm our business and reputation 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
our products are complex and may contain undetected errors  which could harm our reputation and future product sales 
any failure to provide high quality and reliable products  whether caused by our own failure or failures of our suppliers or oem customers  could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our products 
our products have in the past contained  and may in the future contain  undetected errors or defects 
some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been shipped to customers 
any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue  loss of customers  and increased service and warranty costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents the nature of some of our products may also subject us to export control regulation by the us department of state and the department of commerce 
violations of these regulations can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
our sales to customers in some areas outside the united states could be subject to government export regulations or restrictions that prohibit us from selling to customers in some countries or that require us to obtain licenses or approvals to export such products internationally 
delays or denial of the grant of any required license or approval  or changes to the regulations  could make it difficult or impossible to make sales to foreign customers in some countries and could adversely affect our revenue 
in addition  we could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of these export regulations if we were found in violation 
such violation could result in penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
compliance with directives that restrict the use of certain materials may increase our costs and limit our revenue opportunities 
our products and packaging must meet all safety  electrical  labeling  marking  or other requirements of the countries into which we ship products or our resellers sell our products 
we have to assess each product and determine whether it complies with the requirements of local regulations or whether they are exempt from meeting the requirements of the regulations 
if we determine that a product is not exempt and does not comply with adopted regulations  we will have to make changes to the product or its documentation if we want to sell that product into the region once the regulations become effective 
making such changes may be costly to perform and may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the national enforcement bodies of the regions adopting such regulations will agree with our assessment that certain of our products and documentation comply with or are exempt from the regulations 
if products are determined not to be compliant or exempt  we will not be able to ship them in the region that adopts such regulations until such time that they are compliant  and this may have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technologies for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies are currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows me  windows xp  and windows vista operating systems  including directx  microsoft s entertainment api 
modifications and new versions of microsoft s operating system and apis including directx and windows may require that we and or our licensees modify the touch enabling technologies to be compatible with microsoft s modifications or new versions  and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline 
in addition  microsoft announced that its new product  windows  will feature a new multi touch input function  allowing users to use multiple fingers simultaneously to interact with touch surfaces 
enabling multi location touch feedback will require us to innovate hardware and software  enable windows api s with multi touch output support  and work with our licensees and third parties to integrate such features 
there are feasibility risks with both hardware and software  and there may be potential delays in the revenue growth of haptically enabled multi touch surfaces 
if we are unable to develop open source compliant products  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
we have seen  and believe that we will continue to see  an increase in customers requesting that we develop products that will operate in an open source environment 
developing open source compliant products  without imperiling the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends  may prove difficult under 
table of contents certain circumstances  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage for new product designs 
as a result  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the market for certain touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for certain of our touch enabling technologies and certain of our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions  or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees  component customers  and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
negative product reviews or publicity about our company  our products  our licensees products  haptic features  or haptic technology in general could have a negative impact on market adoption  our revenue  and or our ability to license our technologies in the future 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
we rely on our significant patent portfolio to protect our proprietary rights 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court or the patent office were to limit the scope  declare unenforceable  or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments  or they may choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we or our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements  other contractual agreements  and copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our patented technologies  trademarks  and other proprietary rights would be difficult  expensive  and time consuming  within and particularly outside of the united states of america 
certain terms or rights granted in our license agreements or our development contracts may limit our future revenue opportunities 
while it is not our general practice to sign license agreements that provide exclusive rights for a period of time with respect to a technology  field of use  and or geography  or to accept similar limitations in product development contracts  we have entered into such agreements and may in the future 
although additional compensation or other benefits may be part of the agreement  the compensation or benefits may not adequately compensate us for the limitations or restrictions we have agreed to as that particular market develops 
over the life of the exclusivity period  especially in markets that grow larger or faster than anticipated  our revenue may be limited and less than 
table of contents what we could have achieved in the market with several licensees or additional products available to sell to a specific set of customers 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete  and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful or timely 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technologies could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial  and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies or products  the technologies we develop infringe on third party patents or other third party rights  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete or no longer meet new regulatory requirements 
our ability to achieve revenue growth also depends on our continuing ability to improve and reduce the cost of our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 
we have limited engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance and manufacturing resources to design and fulfill favorable product delivery schedules and sufficient levels of quality in support of our different product areas 
products and services may not be delivered in a timely way  with sufficient levels of quality  or at all  which may reduce our revenue 
engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance  and manufacturing resources are deployed against a variety of different projects and programs to provide sufficient levels of quality necessary for channels and customers 
success in various markets may depend on timely deliveries and overall levels of sustained quality and customer service 
failure to provide favorable product and program deliverables and quality and customer service levels  or provide them at all  may disrupt channels and customers  harm our brand  and reduce our revenues 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent their widespread adoption 
personal computer and console gaming peripherals  mobile devices  touchscreens  and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies can be more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as alps electric co  bmw  lg electronics  logitech  microsoft  nokia  samsung  and sony have licensed our technologies  the greater expense of development and production of products containing our touch enabling technologies  together with the higher price to the end customer  may be a significant barrier to their widespread adoption and sale 
medical licensing and certification authorities may not recommend or require use of our technologies for training and or testing purposes and certain legislation that may encourage the use of simulators may not become law  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine abim  the american board of surgery abs  and the american college of cardiology acc  have great influence in recommending particular medical methodologies  including medical training and testing methodologies  for use by 
table of contents medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse medical simulation products in general  or our products or products incorporating our technology in particular  as a training and or testing tool  and in addition in the event that the enhancing simulation act of does not pass into law  market penetration for our products or products incorporating our technology in the medical market could be significantly and adversely affected 
the markets in which we participate or may target in the future are intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
our target markets are rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition  much longer operating histories  larger marketing budgets  and significantly greater resources than we do  and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price  which has resulted in pricing pressures 
if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels  our operating results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales  reduced margins  losses  or the failure of our application suite to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
we face competition from internal design teams of existing and potential oem customers 
in addition  as a result of their licenses to our patent portfolios  we could face competition from microsoft and sony 
our licensees or other third parties may also seek to develop products using our intellectual property or develop alternative designs that attempt to circumvent our intellectual property or that they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 
additionally  if haptic technology gains market acceptance  more research by universities and or corporations or other parties may be performed potentially leading to strong intellectual property positions by third parties in certain areas of haptics or the launch of haptics products before we commercialize our own technology 
many of our current and potential competitors  including microsoft  are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products and services 
in addition  many of our competitors have established marketing relationships or access to larger customer bases  distributors  and other business partners 
as a result  our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
further  some potential customers  particularly large enterprises  may elect to develop their own internal solutions 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
winning business is subject to a competitive selection process that can be lengthy and requires us to incur significant expense  and we may not be selected 
our primary focus is on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  so that haptics will be included in our customers equipment 
these selection processes can be lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
because we typically focus on only a few customers in a product area  the loss of a design win can sometimes result in our failure to get haptics added to new generation products 
this can result in lost sales and could hurt our position in future competitive selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology leader 
after winning a product design for one of our customers  we may still experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development and design cycle 
in addition  a delay or cancellation of a 
table of contents customer s plans could significantly adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue 
finally  if our customers fail to successfully market and sell their equipment it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations as the demand for our products falls 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we may not earn royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless and until automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer or a supplier to an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle or the option packages if our technology is an option for example  a navigation unit  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of major customers could harm our operating results 
our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total net revenue for we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will  continue to generate revenue in any future period 
if we lose a major customer or group of customers  our revenue could decline if we are unable to replace revenue from other sources 
our international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks and costs 
we intend to expand international activities 
international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  foreign exchange and currency risks  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable or longer payment cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties and expense in enforcing intellectual property rights  business risks  including fluctuations in demand for our products and the cost and effort to conduct international operations and travel abroad to promote international distribution and overall global economic conditions  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
our international operations could also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls  or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 

table of contents we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
furthermore  we believe that there are a limited number of engineering and technical personnel that are experienced in haptics 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate  and retain sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of if  how  and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
additionally some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices above the current market price of our common stock or that are largely vested 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technologies  and develop new technologies 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage  or terrorist activity 
a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
an earthquake at or near our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production and shipments of our products or technologies  and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
in addition  california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  and financial condition 
investment risks our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing and recognition of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  the timing of work performed under development agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  stock based awards  acquisitions of technologies  or businesses  the timing of introductions and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees  our competitors  or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  
table of contents our ability to attract  integrate  and retain qualified personnel  seasonality in the demand for our products or our licensees products  and our ability to build or ship products on a timely basis 
our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  changes by game console manufacturers to not include touch enabling capabilities in their products  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of our common stock by insiders or others  stock repurchase activity  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our board of directors or management  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms  only our chairperson of the board of directors  a majority of our board of directors or or greater stockholders are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders  our stockholders can only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent  vacancies on our board of directors can be filled only by our board of directors and not by our stockholders  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  and advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention  or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future  acquire businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities  or increase our intellectual property portfolio 
the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying  investigating  and pursuing suitable acquisitions  whether or not they are consummated 
if we consummate acquisitions through the issuance of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
table of contents difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired intellectual property or other assets  charges associated with amortization of acquired assets or potential charges for write down of assets associated with unsuccessful acquisitions  potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines  and potential costs associated with failed acquisition efforts 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
as our business grows  such growth may place a significant strain on our management and operations and  as a result  our business may suffer 
we plan to continue expanding our business  and any significant growth could place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
we recently transitioned the preparation of all of our internal reporting to upgraded management information systems and are in the process of implementing this system for all of our subsidiaries 
if we encounter problems with the implementation of these systems  we may have difficulties preparing or tracking internal information  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we will need to continue to invest the necessary capital to upgrade and improve our operational  financial and management reporting systems 
if our management fails to manage our growth effectively  we could experience increased costs  declines in product quality  or customer satisfaction  which could harm our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  may  will  and other similar expressions 
however  these words are not the only way we identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements  which refer to expectations  projections  or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in item a  risk factors  those described elsewhere in this report  and those described in our other reports filed with the sec 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that could occur after the filing of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  bad debts  inventory reserves  short term investments  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including accounting standards codification asc s  revenue recognition asc s  asc  multiple element arrangements asc  and asc  software revenue recognition asc 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period based on the judgments and estimates made by our management 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists for a license arrangement  we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us 
for a stand alone product sale  we require a purchase order or other form of written agreement with the customer 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software and product to our customers physically and deliver software also electronically 
for physical deliveries not related to software  our transfer terms typically include transfer of title and risk of loss at our shipping location 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 

table of contents the fee is fixed or determinable 
our arrangement fee is based on the use of standard payment terms which are those that are generally extended to the majority of customers 
for transactions involving extended payment terms  we deem these fees not to be fixed or determinable for revenue recognition purposes and revenue is deferred until the fees become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determined that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when payment is received 
royalty and license revenue we recognize royalty revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee and when collectibility is deemed reasonably assured 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification of royalties within to days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur 
we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the license 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of products and the license of associated software if any  and expense all related costs of products sold  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance  if required  has been achieved 
we have determined that the license of software for the medical simulation products is incidental to the product as a whole 
we typically grant our customers a warranty which guarantees that our products will substantially conform to our current specifications for generally twelve months from the delivery date pursuant to the terms of the arrangement 
historically  warranty related costs have not been significant 
extended warranty contract revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual period 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue is comprised of professional services consulting services and or development contracts 
professional services revenues are recognized under the proportional performance accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed or completed performance method 
a provision for losses on contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
multiple element arrangements we enter into multiple element arrangements in which customers purchase a time based license which include a combination of software and or intellectual property licenses  professional services and to a lesser extent  post contract customer support 
for arrangements that include software and professional services  the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  and customers typically purchase consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to perform these services 
contract fees for professional services and post contract customer support are not frequently sold on a stand alone basis and as such  we do not have sufficient evidence of fair value 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized over the period of the ongoing obligation which is generally consistent with the contractual term of the time based license 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 

table of contents valuation and amortization method we use the black scholes model  single option approach to determine the fair value of stock options  and espp shares 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors that impact the expected term and forfeiture rates  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and espp shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire and be worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock compensation disclosures 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and are reversed at such time that realization is believed to be more likely than not 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions  and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render inaccurate our current assumptions  judgments  and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
any of the assumptions  judgments  and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
short term investments our short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid commercial paper and government agency securities purchased with an original or remaining maturity of greater than days on the date of purchase 
we 
table of contents classify all debt securities with readily determinable market values as available for sale 
even though the stated maturity dates of these debt securities may be one year or more beyond the balance sheet date  we have classified all debt securities as short term investments as they are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold within one year 
these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
we follow the accounting guidance to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statement of operations 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
asc clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
asc also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
in february  the fasb revised asc  that delays the effective date of asc for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until fiscal years beginning after november  the delay is intended to allow the fasb and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of asc the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
further information about short term investments may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recovery of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory valuation we reduce our inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets we have acquired patents and other intangible assets 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal and filing fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets  and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they are issued  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during the year ended december   we capitalized costs associated with patents and trademarks of million 
our total amortization expense for the same period was  
table of contents restructuring costs we calculate our restructuring costs based upon our estimate of workforce reduction costs  asset impairment charges  and other appropriate charges resulting from a restructuring 
based on our assumptions  judgments  and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations overview of we continued to invest in research  development  sales  and marketing in our key business segments 
key events in the year were as follows we believe that our haptics technology is included in million phones worldwide 
we completed the divestiture of our d product line 
operations of our d product line have been retrospectively classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
in conjunction with moving our medical operating segment to san jose  our reduction of workforce from our montreal medical business operations  and other workforce reductions in our touch segment  we had restructuring costs of million 
we had physical inventory write offs of  primarily consisting of physical count to book adjustments of medical equipment parts 
we also recognized fixed asset write offs of demo equipment of  primarily resulting from a reconciliation of the fixed asset records to the physical inventory at the time of the move 
in addition we had inventory obsolescence and scrap expenses of million primarily of medical equipment parts 
in february   we announced plans to focus primarily on a licensing model in the future 
in march we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of the endoscopy  endovascular  and laparoscopy medical simulation product lines 
correspondingly  we plan to pursue the medical segment via a licensing approach 
under a licensing approach  we anticipate that the manufacturing and selling of simulator products to the medical training industry will not be an ongoing focus for us  and therefore  we hope to achieve certain cost reductions in revenue in for these product lines was approximately million 
in  we also expect to continue to focus on the execution of plans in our established businesses to increase revenue and make selected investments for longer term growth areas 
our success could be limited by several factors  including the current macro economic climate  the timely release of our new products and our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors  and the cost of ongoing litigation

royalty and license revenue decreased by  or less than from to the decrease in royalty and license revenue was primarily due to a 
table of contents decrease in royalty and license revenue from gaming and automotive licensees partially offset by increased revenue from licensees of mobile and medical devices 
revenues from gaming customers in which did not recur in included previously deferred revenues from isllc totaling million which was recognized after we concluded our litigation with it 
in addition  bmw has removed our technology from certain controller systems  which also caused automotive royalties to decline in compared to we plan on focusing most of our future business on a licensing model for both the touch and medical segments 
based on our litigation conclusion and business agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment in march  we are recognizing a minimum of million as royalty and license revenue from march through march  which amount to approximately  per quarter 
the revenue from our third party peripheral licensees included in royalty and license revenue has generally continued to decline primarily due to i the reduced sales of past generation video console systems due to the launches of the next generation console models from microsoft xbox  sony playstation ps  and nintendo wii  and ii the decline in third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers due to the launch of next generation peripherals by manufacturers of console systems 
sony has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce peripherals of the ps system 
to the extent sony discourages or impedes third party controller makers from making more ps controllers with vibration feedback  our licensing revenue from third party ps peripherals will continue to be severely limited 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless microsoft broadens its licenses to third party controller makers  particularly with respect to wireless controllers for xbox  our gaming royalty revenue may decline 
additionally  microsoft is now making touch enabled wheels covered by its royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents that could compete with our licensees current or future products for which we earn per unit royalties 
for the nintendo wii video console system launched in december  nintendo has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers for its wii game console 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless nintendo broadens its licenses to third party controller makers  our gaming royalty revenue may decline 
product sales product sales increased by  or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to an increase in medical product sales of  partially offset by a decrease in touch product sales of  increased medical product sales were mainly due to the recognition of million in revenue from an international medical customer for whom revenues could not be recognized until the agreement with the customer was terminated in the third quarter of partially offset by decreases of other medical product sales 
touch interface product sales decreased primarily due to reduced sales of touchscreen and touch panel components and arcade entertainment products 
in march we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of the endoscopy  endovascular  and laparoscopy medical simulation product lines 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue in for these product lines was approximately million 
medical product sales are expected to significantly decline in the future since we will be transitioning to a license model and will have only one product line remaining  the virtual iv product line 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue decreased by million or from to development contracts and other revenue is comprised of revenue on commercial contracts 
the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in medical contract revenue of  due to a lower volume of work performed under medical contracts in compared to we continue to transition our engineering resources from certain commercial development contract efforts to development efforts that focus on leveraging our existing sales and channel distribution capabilities 
accordingly  we do not expect development contract revenue to grow significantly in the future 
for the year ended december   revenues generated in north america  europe  far east  and rest of the world represented    and  respectively  compared to    and  respectively  for the year ended december  the shift in revenues among regions was mainly due to an increase in touch royalty revenue and medical product sales in the far east  a decrease in touch royalty revenue  medical product revenue  and medical contract revenue in north america  a decrease in touch royalty revenue from europe  and a 
table of contents decrease in medical product sales from the rest of the world 
we mainly attribute the increase in revenue in the far east to increased shipments by licensees of mobile devices  partially due to the addition of increased international sales and support personnel in  and recognition of million from an international medical customer as discussed above 
the decrease in touch royalty revenue in north america is partially attributable to previously deferred revenues from isllc totaling million which was recognized in after we concluded our litigation with them 
three customers accounted for of our sales in and two customers accounted for of our sales in as medical product sales are expected to decline in the future since these offerings will no longer be a core strategy  we may see our sales concentrated in fewer large customers in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue our total revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million  from million in royalty and license revenue royalty and license revenue increased by million or from to and was all from our touch segment 
the increase in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of an increase in mobile device license and royalty revenue of million and an increase in gaming royalties of million  offset in part by a decrease in royalties for touch interface products of  mobile device license and royalty revenue increased primarily due to the increase in the shipment of touchsense enabled phones by lg electronics that began in the second quarter of  the signing of a new license contract with mobile device manufacturer nokia at the end of the second quarter of  and the shipment of additional touchsense enabled phones by our licensees in the increase in gaming royalties compared to was mainly due to previously deferred royalty revenues from isllc totaling million which was recognized after we concluded our litigation with them

in addition  there was a full year of royalty and license revenue from first party gaming licensee sony computer entertainment that increased revenue year over year 
although the revenue from our third party peripheral licensees had generally continued to decline primarily due to i the reduced sales of past generation video console systems due to the launches of the next generation console models from microsoft xbox  sony playstation  and nintendo wii  and ii the decline in third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers due to the launch of next generation peripherals by manufacturers of console systems  we saw the decline begin to stabilize  as manifested by the release of new steering wheel products from logitech for the playstation touch interface product royalties decreased mainly due to the recognition of certain automotive royalty payments in the second quarter of that did not recur

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
we will continue to protect and defend our extensive intellectual property portfolio across all business segments 
with our plan to focus on a licensing approach  we hope to achieve certain cost reductions in we anticipate that capital expenditures for the year ended december  will total less than  in connection with anticipated maintenance and upgrades to operations and infrastructure 
cash flows from our discontinued operations have been included in our consolidated statement of cash flows with continuing operations within each cash flow category 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to affect our future liquidity or capital resources 
additionally  if we acquire one or more businesses  patents  or products  our cash or capital requirements could increase substantially 
in the event of such an acquisition  or should any unanticipated circumstances arise that significantly increase our capital requirements  we may elect to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing 
any of these events could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
there is no assurance that such additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements we adopted new accounting requirements for uncertain tax benefits on january  at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaling  including interest of  of which approximately  could be payable in cash 
due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
settlement of such amounts could require the utilization of working capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in these factors may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments we have cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments of million as of december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments as of december  we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
the primary objective of our policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
our policy s guidelines limit exposure to loss by limiting the sums we can invest in any individual security and restricting 
table of contents investment to securities that meet certain defined credit ratings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rates a substantial majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do incur certain operating costs for our foreign operations in other currencies but these operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally we have some reliance on international and export sales that are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign currency hedging arrangements
