item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  significant business development  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent in  which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta  cymbalta  humalog  and zyprexa and the inclusion of erbitux revenue as a result of the imclone systems inc imclone acquisition in november the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in and increased our cost of sales in  which contributed to an improvement in gross margin 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue  while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than sales 
we incurred income tax expense of billion in resulting in an effective tax rate of percent 
earnings increased to billion  and earnings per share increased to per share  in as compared to a net loss of billion  and a loss per share of in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of the following significant items acquisitions note we incurred acquired in process research and development ipr d charges associated with an in licensing arrangement with incyte corporation incyte of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site to an affiliate of evonik industries ag 
we incurred pretax charges of million representing the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with the claims of several states related to zyprexa  which decreased earnings per share by 
acquisitions note we recognized charges totaling billion pretax associated with the acquisition of imclone  which decreased earnings per share by 
these amounts include an ipr d charge of billion pretax 
the remaining net expenses are related to imclone s operating results subsequent to the acquisition  incremental interest costs  and amortization of the intangible asset associated with erbitux 
we also incurred ipr d charges of million pretax associated with the acquisition of sgx pharmaceuticals  inc sgx  which decreased earnings per share by 
we incurred ipr d charges associated with licensing arrangements with bioms medical corp 
bioms and transpharma medical ltd 
totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
a similar charge of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by  was included in cost of sales 
these charges were primarily associated with the sale of our greenfield  indiana site  the termination of the air insulin program  and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations 
we recorded charges of billion pretax related to the federal and state zyprexa investigations led by the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa  as well as the resolution of a multi state investigation regarding zyprexa involving states and the district of columbia  which decreased earnings per share by other note we recognized a discrete income tax benefit of million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit of our federal income tax returns for the years through  which increased earnings per share by 
late stage pipeline developments and business development activity our long term success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we currently have over potential new drugs in human testing 
a number of late stage pipeline developments and business development transactions occurred within the past year  including pipeline the united states food and drug administration fda approved an expanded indication for byetta as a standalone medication monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes 
the fda approved zyprexa relprevv for extended release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults 
we also launched this product under the tradename zypadhera in several countries within the european union 
we announced initial results from a phase iii clinical trial for arzoxifene 
after reviewing the overall clinical profile of arzoxifene in light of currently available treatments  including our own osteoporosis products  we decided not to submit the compound for regulatory review 
the fda approved a new use for forteo to treat osteoporosis associated with sustained  systemic glucocorticoid therapy in men and women at high risk of fracture 
we and our partner bioms discontinued phase iii clinical trials for dirucotide in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
data showed that dirucotide did not meet the primary endpoint of delaying disease progression and there were no statistically significant differences between dirucotide and placebo on the secondary endpoints of the study 
the fda approved effient tablets for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes acs who are managed with an artery opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention pci 
we and our partner  daiichi sankyo  inc  launched effient in the us in august 
the european commission granted marketing authorization for efient for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acs undergoing pci 
the fda approved alimta as a maintenance therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc  specifically for patients with a nonsquamous histology whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum based first line chemotherapy 
the european commission granted approval for the use of alimta as monotherapy for maintenance treatment of patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology in locally advanced or metastatic nsclc  whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum based chemotherapy 
alimta received regulatory approval in japan as both a first and second line treatment of nsclc 
we and our partners amylin pharmaceuticals  inc amylin and alkermes  inc  submitted a new drug application nda to the fda for exenatide once weekly 
exenatide once weekly is an investigational sustained release medication for type diabetes that is injected subcutaneously and administered only once a week 
we began enrolling patients in two separate but identical phase iii clinical trials of solanezumab  an anti amyloid beta monoclonal antibody being investigated as a potential treatment to delay the progression of mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
the trials each include a treatment period that lasts months and are expected to enroll a total of  patients age and over from countries 
the fda approved two new combination indications for zyprexa olanzapine and fluoxetine for the acute treatment of bipolar depression and trd in adults 
we received a complete response letter from the fda for the first line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck scchn supplemental biologics license application sbla for erbitux 
business development we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with incyte for the development and commercialization of incyte s oral jak jak inhibitor  and certain follow on compounds  for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
the lead compound is currently being studied in a six month dose ranging phase ii trial for rheumatoid arthritis 
we entered into a co promotion agreement with kowa pharmaceutical america to commercialize livalo pitavastatin in the united states 
lilly and kowa company  limited have also entered into a licensing agreement in latin america 
livalo is a statin approved by the fda in august for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
we plan to launch livalo in the us in mid in january  we restructured the collaboration agreement executed by bristol myers squibb and imclone in to allow for the co development and co commercialization of the late stage oncology molecule necitumumab imc f  which is currently in phase iii clinical testing for non small cell lung cancer 
under the restructured agreement  both companies will share in the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the us  canada and japan 
we maintain exclusive rights to necitumumab in all other markets 
legal  regulatory  and other matters in september  we set a goal to reduce our expected cost structure by billion by the end of we also plan to lower global headcount to  by the end of  excluding strategic sales force additions in high growth emerging markets and japan  which could result in future periodic restructuring charges 
in january  we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the edpa  and the state medicaid fraud control units of states and the district of columbia  of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
we recorded a charge of billion for this matter in the third quarter of in  we paid substantially all of this amount  as required by the settlement agreements 
in addition  in october  we reached a settlement with states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws  under which we paid million 
however  we were served with lawsuits brought by attorneys general of a number of states  alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug and seeking to recover the costs paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
in  we incurred pretax charges of million  reflecting the probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims 
we have reached settlements or are in advanced discussions to settle all of the remaining state claims 
the pennsylvania case is set for trial in april in state court 
health care reform is currently the subject of intense debate in the us congress 
the impact of reform on the pharmaceutical industry is uncertain 
most reform proposals intend to provide coverage for the uninsured  include increasing existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs and the expansion of rebates  or other pharmaceutical company discounts  into new programs 
there are also proposals that will impose new fees on pharmaceutical industry sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products 
certain federal and state health care reform proposals that go beyond providing additional health insurance coverage for the uninsured may also place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices 
these proposals include reducing incentives for employer sponsored health care  the creation of an independent commission to propose changes to medicare  with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in medicare part d  which lowers the projections for future government spending in medicare  and a government run public option with biopharmaceutical price setting capabilities 
additionally  various proposals could legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow  or require  the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in addition  the federal government is considering creating an expedited regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars copies of biological compounds for biologic products in the us  the proposals vary as to which biologic products would be eligible  how quickly a biosimilar might reach the market  and the ability to interchange the biosimilar and the original biologic product at the pharmacy 
we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
in its budget submission to congress in february  the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of us based companies 
while it is uncertain how the us congress may address this issue  reform of us taxation  including taxation of international income  continues to be a topic of discussion for the us congress 
a significant change to the us tax system  including changes to the taxation of international income  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls  limit access to or reimbursement for our products  or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
these proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact  given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments 
operating results revenue our worldwide revenue for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by growth of alimta  cymbalta  humalog  and zyprexa  and the inclusion of erbitux revenue as a result of the imclone acquisition

our revenues were million in  compared with million in we acquired erbitux as part of our acquisition of imclone in november animal health product sales in the us increased percent  primarily driven by the inclusion of posilac sales following the acquisition completed october sales outside the us decreased percent  driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin increased to percent of total revenue compared with percent for this increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year  which decreased cost of sales as in  but increased cost of sales in marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside the us  higher incentive compensation  and the impact of the imclone acquisition  partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to the imclone acquisition and increased late stage clinical trial costs 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with the in licensing agreement with incyte  compared with billion in the ipr d charge included billion resulting from the acquisition of imclone 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  primarily related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site and special charges related to zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys general  compared with billion in the charges were primarily associated with the resolution of zyprexa investigations with the us attorney for the edpa and multiple states 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense  income was a net expense in both years  increasing by million  to million in  primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense resulting from the imclone acquisition 
we incurred income tax expense of billion in resulting in an effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate for was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe site 
we incurred tax expense of million in  despite having a loss before income taxes of billion 
our net loss was driven by the billion ipr d charge for imclone and the billion zyprexa investigation settlements 
the ipr d charge was not tax deductible  and only a portion of the zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible 
in addition  we recorded tax expense associated with the imclone acquisition  as well as a discrete income tax benefit of million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating results financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products 
the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales  driven by pre launch activities associated with effient  marketing costs associated with cymbalta and evista  the impact of foreign exchange rates  and increased litigation related expenses  while our investment in research and development grew percent 
we completed our acquisition of imclone  resulting in a significant charge of billion for ipr d and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa  resulting in an additional charge of billion 
we incurred tax expense of million  despite a loss before income taxes of billion  primarily caused by the non deductibility of the imclone ipr d charge and the partial deductibility of the zyprexa investigation settlements 
accordingly  earnings decreased to a net loss of billion  and earnings per share decreased to a loss of per share  in as compared with net income of billion  and earnings per share of  in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of several significant items 
the significant items for are summarized in the executive overview 
the items are summarized as follows acquisitions note we incurred ipr d charges associated with the acquisitions of icos corporation icos  hypnion  inc hypnion  and ivy animal health  inc ivy  totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by

asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
these charges were primarily associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities 
we incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over zyprexa product liability claims  which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries  and other product liability charges 
this resulted in a charge totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by

acquired ipr d charges related to the acquisitions of imclone and sgx  as well as our in licensing arrangements with bioms and transpharma  were billion in as compared to million in we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of billion in  as compared to million in the charges were primarily associated with the resolution of zyprexa investigations with the us attorney for the edpa and multiple states 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense income changed from net income of million in to net expense of million in  primarily as a result of lower outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment securities in the majority of which consisted of unrealized losses 
we incurred tax expense of million in  despite having a loss before income taxes of billion 
our net loss was driven by the billion acquired ipr d charge for imclone and the billion zyprexa investigation settlements 
the ipr d charge was not tax deductible  and only a portion of the zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible 
in addition  we recorded tax expense associated with the imclone acquisition  as well as a discrete income tax benefit of million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit 
the effective tax rate was percent in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  the decrease in cash was driven by a reduction in short term borrowings of billion and dividends paid of billion  partially offset by cash from operations of billion which included payments related to the zyprexa edpa settlement of billion and proceeds of long term debt issuances of billion 
capital expenditures of million during were million less than in we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities  continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems  and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products 
total debt at december   was billion  a decrease of billion from december  reflecting the pay down of our commercial paper that was issued to finance our acquisition of imclone  partially offset by billion of long term debt we issued in march our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain at aa and a  respectively 
dividends of per share were paid in  an increase of percent from in the fourth quarter of  effective for the first quarter dividend in  the quarterly dividend was maintained at 
per share  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
the year was the th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments 
despite increasing unemployment and declines in real consumer spending  consumer confidence has grown and job losses have slowed during the second half of many financial institutions continue to have tightened lines of credit  thus reducing funding available to stimulate near term economic growth 
while there are some positive signs  the prospects for recovery are uncertain 
pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns  however  an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding to the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the us in addition  both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care  including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs 
we continue to monitor the potential near term impact of prescription trends  the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers  the evolving health care debate  the federal government s involvement in the economic crisis  and various international government funding levels 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  costs associated with litigation and government investigations  and dividends in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings 
our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the illiquidity in the markets because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in may various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues  cash flows  and earnings 
in the next three years we will lose effective exclusivity for zyprexa in major european countries september and the us october  and for humalog in major european countries november 
gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in major european countries 
in addition  we face us patent litigation over several key patent protected products whose exclusivity extends beyond  including alimta  cymbalta  evista  gemzar  and strattera and it is possible we could face an unexpected loss of our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the end of revenue from each of these products contributes materially to our results of operations  liquidity  and financial position  and the loss of exclusivity could result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product 
however  we plan to mitigate the effect on our operations  liquidity and financial position through growth in our remaining business and the previously announced plan to reduce our expected cost structure by billion by the end of in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
we excluded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of  million  as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales return  rebate  and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
for more than percent of our sales  this is at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
the remaining sales  which are outside the us  are recorded at the point of delivery 
provisions for returns  rebates  and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
in the us  the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 
we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns 
we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
once the product is returned  it is destroyed 
consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance  we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales 
this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
because of this time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales returns  rebates  and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
us sales returns  federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by billion  billion  and million in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the sales return  medicaid  and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our sales returns  medicaid  and medicare rebate liability was million 
our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately percent and percent of our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us returns  rebate  and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to sales returns  discounts  and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these returns  rebates  and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial condition of the insurers  and the possibility of and length of time for collection 
in the past few years  we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
periodically  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by million 
a one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by million 
the us plans represent approximately percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of million and million  respectively 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to  excluding the potential impact of health care reform in the us and restructuring charges resulting from previously announced strategic headcount reductions 
we expect volume driven revenue growth in the high single digits  driven primarily by alimta  cymbalta  humalog  cialis  effient and the exenatide franchise 
we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be flat to declining 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low to mid single digits while research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits 
other net  expense income is expected to be a net expense of between million and million 
cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately billion  anticipated business development activity  and our dividend 
we caution investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by us  including those above  are based on management s belief at the time they are made 
however  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges  foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions  changes in effective tax rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  patent disputes  and government investigations  and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  as well as proposed health care reform currently being discussed by the us congress 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters  we believe that  except as specifically noted below  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 
patent litigation we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatch waxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of cymbalta sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking permission to market generic versions of cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents the earliest of which expires in 
of these challengers  all allege non infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation  and nine allege invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine 
of the nine challengers to the compound patent claims  one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia  and one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable 
in november we filed lawsuits in us district court for the southern district of indiana against actavis elizabeth llc  aurobindo pharma ltd  cobalt laboratories  inc  impax laboratories  inc  lupin limited  sandoz inc  and wockhardt limited  seeking rulings that the patents are valid  infringed  and enforceable 
we filed similar lawsuits in the same court against sun pharma global  inc in december and against anchen pharmaceuticals  inc in august the cases have been consolidated and actions against all but wockhardt limited have been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal 
gemzar mayne pharma usa inc  now hospira  inc 
hospira  fresenius kabi oncology plc fresenius  sicor pharmaceuticals  inc  now teva parenteral medicines  inc teva  and sun pharmaceutical industries inc sun each submitted an anda seeking permission to market generic versions of gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents compound patent expiring in and method of use patent expiring in  and alleging that these patents are invalid 
sandoz inc sandoz and app pharmaceuticals  llc app have similarly challenged our method of use patent 
we filed lawsuits in the us district court for the southern district of indiana against teva february  hospira october and january  sandoz october  app december  and fresenius february  seeking rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed 
sandoz withdrew its anda and the suit against it was dismissed in february the trial against teva was held in september and we are waiting for a ruling 
teva s andas have been approved by the fda  however  teva must provide days notice prior to marketing generic gemzar to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction 
both suits against hospira have been administratively closed  and the parties have agreed to be bound by the results of the teva suit 
in november  sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  seeking rulings that our method of use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable  or would not be infringed by the sale of sun s generic product 
in august  the district court granted a motion by sun for partial summary judgment  invalidating our method of use patent 
we have appealed this decision 
this ruling has no bearing on the compound patent 
the trial originally scheduled for december has been postponed while the court considers sun s second summary judgment motion  related to the validity of our compound patent 
sun and app have received tentative approval for their products from the fda  but are prohibited from entering the market by month stays  which expire in june for sun and may for app 
alimta teva parenteral medicines  inc teva  app  and barr laboratories  inc barr each submitted andas seeking approval to market generic versions of alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant us patent licensed from the trustees of princeton university and expiring in  and alleging the patent is invalid

the trial against teva was completed in march in september  the court upheld our method of use patents the last expires in 
teva has appealed that ruling 
in addition  the court held that our particle size patent expiring is invalid 
we have appealed that ruling 
strattera actavis elizabeth llc actavis  apotex inc apotex  aurobindo pharma ltd 
aurobindo  mylan pharmaceuticals inc mylan  sandoz inc sandoz  sun pharmaceutical industries limited sun  and teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva each submitted an anda seeking permission to market generic versions of strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant us patent expiring in  and alleging that this patent is invalid 
in  we brought a lawsuit against actavis  apotex  aurobindo  mylan  sandoz  sun  and teva in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
the court has ruled on all pending summary judgment motions  and granted our infringement motion 
the remaining invalidity defenses will be decided at trial  which could take place as early as the third quarter of several companies have received tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine  but are prohibited from entering the market by a month stay which expires in november we believe each of these hatch waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation 
however  it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us in canada  several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our zyprexa patent expiring in 
in april  the canadian federal court ruled against the first challenger  apotex inc apotex  and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in february in june  the canadian federal court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger  novopharm ltd 
novopharm  was justified and denied our request that novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in canada 
novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in canada in the third quarter of in september  the canadian federal court ruled against us in the novapharm suit  finding our patent invalid 
we have appealed this decision 
if the decision is upheld  we could face liability for damages related to delays in the launch of generic olanzapine products  however  we have concluded at this time that the damages are not probable or estimable 
in germany  the german federal supreme court upheld the validity of our zyprexa patent expiring in in december  reversing an earlier decision of the federal patent court 
following the decision of the supreme court  the generic companies who launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier decision either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to injunction 
we are pursuing these companies for damages arising from infringement 
we have received challenges in a number of other countries  including spain  the united kingdom uk  and several smaller european countries 
in spain  we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenges  but additional actions are now pending 
in the uk  the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer dr 
reddy s laboratories uk limited dr 
reddy s has challenged the validity of our zyprexa patent expiring in 
in october  the patents court in the high court  london ruled that our patent was valid 
dr 
reddy s appealed this decision 
the uk court of appeal affirmed the validity of the patent in december dr 
reddy s did not seek further appeal to the uk supreme court  therefore the uk proceedings are concluded 
we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a country by country basis 
we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation 
the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
xigris and evista in june  ariad pharmaceuticals  inc ariad  the massachusetts institute of technology  the whitehead institute for biomedical research  and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us  alleging that sales of two of our products  xigris and evista  were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body  and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products 
following jury and bench trials on separate issues  the us district court of massachusetts entered final judgment in september that ariad s claims were valid  infringed  and enforceable  and finding damages in the amount of million plus a percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision 
however  the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal are exhausted 
in april  the court of appeals for the federal circuit overturned the district court judgment  concluding that ariad s asserted patent claims are invalid 
in august  the court of appeals agreed to review this decision en banc  thereby vacating the court of appeals decision 
the en banc hearing occurred in december and we are awaiting a decision 
nevertheless  we believe that these allegations are without legal merit  that we will ultimately prevail on these issues  and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 
zyprexa litigation we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 

since june  we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims 
the agreements cover a total of approximately  claimants  including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims 
the two primary settlements were as follows in  we settled and paid more than  claims for million  plus million to cover administration of the settlement 
in  we settled and paid more than  claims for approximately million 
we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims 
the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately lawsuits in the us covering approximately plaintiffs  of which about cases covering about plaintiffs are part of the mdl 
the mdl cases have been scheduled for trial in groups  and no specific trial dates for trial groups have been assigned 
we also have trials scheduled in texas state court in may and august and in ohio in august in january  we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa  and the state medicaid fraud control units of states and the district of columbia  of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
as part of the resolution  we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act for the off label promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia  including alzheimer s dementia  between september and march we recorded a charge of billion for this matter in the third quarter of in  we paid substantially all of this amount  as required by the settlement agreements 
as part of the settlement  we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs  which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years 
the agreement also provides for an independent third party review organization to assess and report on the company s systems  processes  policies  procedures  and practices 
in october  we reached a settlement with states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws 
while there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted  we accrued and paid million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years  through consent decrees filed with the settling states 
we have been served with lawsuits filed by the states of alaska  arkansas  connecticut  idaho  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  montana  new mexico  pennsylvania  south carolina  utah  and west virginia alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
these suits seek to recover the costs paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred by the states to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
the connecticut  idaho  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  montana  new mexico  and west virginia cases are part of the mdl proceedings in the edny 
the alaska case was settled in march for a payment of million  plus terms designed to ensure  subject to certain limitations and conditions  that alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims 
we are in advanced discussions with the attorneys general for several of these states  seeking to resolve their zyprexa related claims  and we have agreed to settlements with the states of arkansas  connecticut  idaho  mississippi  new mexico  south carolina  utah  and west virginia 
in the second and third quarters of  we incurred pretax charges of million and million  respectively  reflecting the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims 
the pennsylvania case is set for trial in april in state court 
in  two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit  which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in on similar grounds 
in september  judge weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors  excluding governmental entities and individual consumers 
we appealed the certification order  and judge weinstein s order denying our motion for summary judgment  in september while the second circuit court of appeals heard oral arguments on the appeal in december  no opinions have been rendered 
in  the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees  who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
in december  the court granted our summary judgment motion  dismissing the case 
plaintiffs have appealed this decision 
in early  we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa 
one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec  and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents except for residents of quebec and british columbia 
the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the product liability litigation pending in the us we are in advanced discussions to resolve all zyprexa class action litigation in canada 
we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted 
the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
other product liability litigation we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des  thimerosal  and byetta 
the majority of these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
product liability insurance because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past several years  we have been unable to attain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future
