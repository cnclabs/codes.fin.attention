item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview the company is a bank holding company which owns of the stock of first capital bank the bank 
we are headquartered in glen allen  virginia and conduct our primary operations through our wholly owned subsidiary 
through its seven full service branch offices and courier service  the bank serves the greater richmond metropolitan area which includes the counties of henrico  chesterfield and hanover  the town of ashland and the city of richmond  virginia 
we target small to medium sized businesses and consumers in our market area and emerging suburbs outside of the greater richmond metropolitan area 
in addition  we strive to develop personal  knowledgeable relationships with our customers  while at the same time offering products comparable to statewide regional banks located in its market area 
we believe that the marketing of customized banking services has enabled it to establish a niche in the financial services marketplace in the richmond metropolitan area 
the difficult economic environment during negatively impacted our financial performance as we realized a net income of thousand for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the year ended december  net loss available to common shareholders  which deducts from net income the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  was a loss of thousand for the year ended december  compared to thousand a year ago 
key factors affecting the full year results included significant higher fdic premiums  million provision to loans due to increasing charge offs and transaction costs in connection with a planned merger which was subsequently terminated 
for the year ended december   assets grew million to million or from million at december  total net loans at december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the december  amount of million 
deposits increased million to million  or from the december  amount of million 
net interest margin decreased in from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the net interest margin was for the same period in during  the federal open market committee of the federal reserve fomc maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at to and reiterated its intent to hold the federal funds rate exceptionally low for an extended period 
the decline in the target federal funds rate throughout the last two years had placed downward pressure on the company s earning asset yields and related net interest income 
during the third and fourth quarters of  however  repricing of money market accounts and certificates of deposit provided significant relief from this trend 
the company also expects net interest margin to be relatively stable over the next several quarters based on the current yield curve 
we remain well capitalized with capital ratios above the regulatory minimums 
as we enter however  the financial sector remains in turmoil 
pressure continues on the net interest margin and asset quality continues to deteriorate 

table of contents critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and applications of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
first capital bank s critical accounting policy relates to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb loss in the bank s existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i asc contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and can be reasonably estimated  and ii asc receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to applicable gaap 
management s estimate of each homogenous pool component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
this evaluation includes credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes  geographic  borrower and industry concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations 
these factors  as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions  are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations 
applicable gaap requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
this statement also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on impaired loans 
reserves for commercial loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on historical loss experience and management s evaluation and risk grading of the commercial loan portfolio 
reserves are provided for noncommercial loan categories using historical loss factors applied to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan category 
additionally  environmental factors based on national and local economic conditions  as well as portfolio specific attributes  are considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or  if required by regulators  based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
such adjustments to original estimates  as necessary  are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended december  increased to thousand from thousand for the year ended december  returns on equity and assets for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  loan growth resulted in an increase in interest income as interest on loans increased thousand to million from million in after increasing million in compared to investments increased million during resulting in an increase in interest on investments of

net interest income we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
interest expense is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
net interest income represents our principal source of earnings 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net interest income for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  net interest income increased despite a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the comparable period of average earning assets increased million  or  to million for from million for average loans  net of unearned income increased million  or for to million 
actual loan balances increased million in compared to million in the average rate earned on net loans  decreased basis points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in the average rate earned on net loans was the result of the decrease of basis points in the prime rate during the prime rate remained unchanged at for the entire year of the average balance in our securities portfolio increased million in to million from million in we used liquidity generated by deposits and tarp funds to mitigate interest rate risk and pick up spreads over the federal funds rate

table of contents non performing assets we place loans on a non accrual when the collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when we place a loan on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals on interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses to be charged against earnings

these lines of credit  which bear interest at prevailing market rates  permit us to borrow funds in the overnight market  and are renewable annually 
advances from the fhlb constitute convertible advances with contractual maturities of five to ten years 
all convertible advances have a call option remaining of various terms 
interest rate sensitivity the most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the income stream of the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or repriced in specific periods 
our goal is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates 
we seek to meet this goal by influencing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the various lending and deposit taking lines of business and by managing discretionary balance sheet asset and liability portfolios 
we monitor interest rate levels on a daily basis at meetings of the asset liability sub committee 
the following reports and or tools are used to assess the current interest rate environment and its impact on our earnings and liquidity monthly and year to date net interest margin and spread calculations  monthly and year to date balance sheet and income statements versus budget  quarterly net portfolio value analysis  a weekly survey of rates offered by other local competitive institutions and gap analysis matching maturities or repricing dates of interest sensitive assets to those of interest sensitive liabilities by periods and a risk manager model used to measure earnings at risk and economic value of equity at risk 
the data in the following table reflects repricing or expected maturities of various assets and liabilities 
the gap analysis represents the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap analysis presents a position that existed at one particular point in time  and assumes that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics will reprice at the same time and to the same degree
