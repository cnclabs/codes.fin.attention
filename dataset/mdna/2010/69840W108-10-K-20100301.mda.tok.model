use of non gaap measurements we include in this report information on company owned  franchise operated and system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages 
company owned comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales from bakery cafes that have been in operation and company owned for at least months 
franchise operated comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales from franchised bakery cafes  as reported by franchisees  that have been in operation and franchise operated for at least months 
system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales at both company owned and franchise operated bakery cafes that have been in operation and company owned or franchise operated for at least months 
acquired company owned and franchise operated bakery cafe locations and other restaurant or bakery cafe concepts are excluded from comparable bakery cafe sales until we have held a percent ownership interest therein for at least months 
comparable bakery cafe sales exclude closed locations and currently  paradise bakery caf  inc  or paradise  locations 
comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are non gaap financial measures  which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap  and may not be equivalent to comparable bakery cafe sales as defined or used by other companies 
we do not record franchise operated bakery cafe sales as revenues 
however  royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise operated bakery cafe sales  as reported by franchisees 
we use franchise operated and system wide sales information internally in connection with store development decisions  planning  and budgeting analyses 
we believe franchise operated and system wide sales information is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of our brand  facilitates an understanding of financial performance and the overall direction and trends of sales and operating income  helps us appreciate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives to which our franchisees also contribute based on a percentage of their sales  and provides information that is relevant for comparison within the industry 

table of contents we also include in this report information on company owned  franchise operated and system wide average weekly sales 
average weekly sales are calculated by dividing total net sales by operating weeks 
accordingly  year over year results reflect sales for all locations  whereas comparable bakery cafe sales exclude closed locations and paradise and are based on sales for bakery cafes that have been in operation and owned for at least months 
new stores typically experience an opening honeymoon period during which they generate higher average weekly sales in the first to weeks they are open as customers settle in to normal usage patterns from initial trial of the location 
on average  the settle in experienced is percent to percent less than the average weekly sales during the honeymoon period 
as a result  year over year results of average weekly sales are generally lower than the results in comparable bakery cafe sales 
this results from the relationship of the number of bakery cafes in the honeymoon phase  the number of bakery cafes in the settle in phase  and the number of bakery cafes in the comparable bakery cafe base

comparable bakery cafe sales fiscal and fiscal each contained weeks of sales while fiscal contained weeks of sales  with an impact of million and million  respectively  of sales in the additional week of fiscal for company owned and franchise operated bakery cafes 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to provide the following three separate measures of comparable bakery cafe sales for fiscal calendar basis  adjusted fiscal basis  and fiscal basis 
calendar basis we believe that comparable bakery cafe sales percentages presented on a calendar basis  which match the specific weeks in a fiscal year to the same specific weeks in another  are useful in understanding our sales results because such comparisons are generally not impacted by the shifting of seasonal holidays between fiscal periods from one year to another or by additional weeks of sales in a particular fiscal period

the comparable company owned bakery cafe sales growth on a calendar basis was driven by approximately percent transaction growth and approximately percent average check growth 
average check growth  in turn  was comprised of retail price increases of approximately percent and negative mix impact of approximately percent in comparison to the prior fiscal year

an ada requires a franchisee to develop a specified number of bakery cafes on or before specific dates 
if a franchisee fails to develop bakery cafes on schedule  we have the right to terminate the ada and develop company owned locations or develop locations through new area developers in that market

the columbia portfolio included investments in certain asset backed securities and structured investment vehicles that were collateralized by sub prime mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities  among other assets 
as a result of adverse market conditions that unfavorably affected the fair value and liquidity of collateral underlying the columbia portfolio  it was overwhelmed with withdrawal requests from investors and was closed  with a restriction placed upon the cash redemption ability of its holders in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we received million of cash redemptions at an average net asset value of per unit  which fully redeemed our remaining units in the columbia portfolio  and we classified the redemptions as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities 
in total  we recognized a net realized and unrealized gain on the columbia portfolio units of million in fiscal related to the fair value measurements and redemptions received and included the net gain in net cash provided by operating activities 
as the columbia portfolio units were no longer trading and  therefore  had little or no price transparency  we assessed the fair value of the underlying collateral for the columbia portfolio through review of current investment ratings  as available  coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of assets held by each investment and their subsequent distribution of cash 
we then utilized this assessment of the underlying collateral from multiple indicators of fair value  which were then adjusted to reflect the expected timing of disposition and market risks to arrive at an estimated fair value of the columbia portfolio units of per unit  or million  as of december   and per unit  or million  as of december  during fiscal  we received million of cash redemptions at an average net asset value of per unit  which we classified as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities 
in total  we recognized a net realized and unrealized loss on the columbia portfolio units of million in fiscal related to the fair value measurements and redemptions received and included the net loss in net cash provided by operating activities 
during fiscal  we received million of cash redemptions at an average net asset value of subsequent to the withdrawal restriction  which we classified as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities 
in total  we recognized a net realized and unrealized loss on the columbia portfolio units of million in fiscal related to the fair value measurements and redemptions received and included the net loss in net cash provided by operating activities 
during fiscal and fiscal  we had no investments in us treasury notes and government agency securities  and we made no additional purchases of investments 
during fiscal  the remaining million of investments in government securities outstanding matured or were called by the issuer and we did not purchase any additional investments in government securities 
we recognized interest income on the investments in government securities of million during fiscal this interest income included premium amortization of million and is classified in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements 
financing activities financing activities in fiscal included million received from the exercise of employee stock options  million received from the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  and million received from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  partially offset by million used to purchase the remaining interest of paradise and million to repurchase our class a common stock 
financing activities in fiscal included million used in net repayments under our credit facility  million used to repurchase our class a common stock  million received from the exercise of stock options  million received from the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  million received from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  and million used for debt issuance costs 
financing activities in fiscal included million from borrowings under a credit facility  million from the exercise of stock options  million from the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  million used to repurchase common stock and million used for debt issuance costs 

table of contents purchase of noncontrolling interest on june   we exercised our right to purchase the remaining percent of the outstanding stock of paradise  excluding certain agreed upon assets totaling million  for a purchase price of million  million in transaction costs  and settlement of million of debt owed to us by the shareholders of the remaining percent of paradise 
approximately million of the purchase price  as well as the transaction costs  were paid on june   with million retained by us for certain holdbacks 
the holdbacks are primarily for certain indemnifications and expire on the second anniversary of the transaction closing date  with any remaining holdback amounts reverting to the prior shareholders of the remaining percent of paradise 
the transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction  by adjusting the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest balance to reflect the change in our ownership interest in paradise  with the difference between fair value of the consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest was adjusted recognized in equity attributable to us 
share repurchases on november   our board of directors approved a three year share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock 
the share repurchases will be effected from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and we may make such repurchases under a rule b plan 
repurchased shares will be retired immediately and will resume the status of authorized but unissued shares 
the repurchase program may be modified  suspended  or discontinued by our board of directors at any time 
under the share repurchase program  we repurchased a total of  shares of our class a common stock at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million in fiscal on november   in connection with a share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on november   we entered into a written trading plan in compliance with rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended  to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our class a common stock  subject to maximum per share purchase price 
under the share repurchase program  we repurchased a total of  shares of our class a common stock at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased a total of  shares of our class a common stock at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million  which completed this share repurchase program 
repurchased shares were retired immediately and resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares 
we have historically repurchased shares of our class a common stock through a share repurchase program approved by our board of directors from participants of the panera bread stock incentive plan and the panera bread stock incentive plan  or collectively  the plans  which are netted and surrendered as payment for applicable tax withholding on the vesting of their restricted stock

during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of class a common stock surrendered by participants in the plans at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million pursuant to the terms of the plans and the applicable award agreements 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of class a common stock surrendered by participants in the plans at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million pursuant to the terms of the plans and the applicable award agreements 
these share repurchases were not made pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs 
credit facility on march   we  and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  as guarantors  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  referred to as the amended and restated credit agreement  with bank of america  na  and other lenders party thereto to amend and restate in its entirety our credit agreement  dated as of november   by and among us  bank of america  na  and the lenders party thereto  referred to as the original credit agreement 
pursuant to our request under the terms of the original credit agreement  the amended and restated credit agreement increased the size of our secured revolving credit facility from million to million 
we may select interest rates equal to a the base rate which is defined as the higher of bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus percent  or b libor plus an applicable rate  ranging from percent to percent  based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as each term is defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement allows us from time to time to request that the credit facility be further increased by an amount not to exceed  in the aggregate  million  subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent 
the amended and restated credit agreement contains financial covenants that  among other things  require the maintenance of certain leverage and fixed charges coverage ratios 
the credit facility  which is secured by the capital stock of our present and future material subsidiaries  will become due on march   subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults  including breaches of representations or covenants  failure to pay other material indebtedness or a change of control of our company  as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
the proceeds from the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions and share repurchases 
as of december  and december   we had no balance outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable  based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
variances in the estimates or assumptions used could yield materially different accounting results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
we consider our policies on accounting for revenue recognition  valuation of goodwill  self insurance  income taxes  lease obligations  and stock based compensation to be the most critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
there have been no material changes to our application of critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates since december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from bakery cafe sales upon delivery of the related food and other products to the customer 
revenue from fresh dough sales to franchisees is recorded upon delivery of fresh dough to franchisees 
also  a liability is recorded in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized as a sale 
further  franchise fees are the result of the sale of area development rights and the sale of individual franchise locations to third parties 
the initial franchise fee is generally  per bakery cafe to be developed under the area development agreement  or ada 
of this fee   is generally paid at the time of signing of the ada and is recognized as revenue when it is received as it is non refundable and we have to perform no other service to earn this fee 
the remainder of the fee is paid at the time an individual franchise agreement is signed and is recognized as revenue upon the opening of the bakery cafe 
royalties are generally paid weekly based on a percentage of sales specified in each ada generally percent to percent of sales 
royalties are recognized as revenue when they are earned 
valuation of goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
at december  and december   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill  by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
as quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  fair value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows  with forecasted average growth rates of approximately four percent and average discount rates of percent used in the fiscal analysis for the reporting units  which are commensurate with the risks involved in the reporting units 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 

table of contents assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of goodwill  and could result in impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances between forecasted cash flows and actual results include but are not limited to i fluctuations in sales volumes  ii commodity costs  such as wheat and fuel  and iii acceptance of our pricing actions undertaken in response to rapidly changing commodity prices and other product costs 
refer to forward looking statements included in the beginning of our fiscal form k for further information regarding the impact of estimates of future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the reporting units  future growth rate  and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease in cash flows  and made changes to our projected growth rate and discount rate which we believe are considered appropriate 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of september   the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter  the outlined changes in our assumptions would not affect the results of the impairment test  as all reporting units still have an excess of fair value over the carrying value 
as of december   we determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
while the fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value under the present value of expected future cash flows model by more than percent for all of our reporting units  there can be no assurance future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  group health  and general  auto  and property liability insurance with varying levels of deductibles of as much as million of individual claims  depending on the type of claim 
we also purchase aggregate stop loss and or layers of loss insurance in many categories of loss 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data  as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data to determine required self insurance reserves 
the assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if actual experience related to the number of claims and cost per claim differs from these assumptions and historical trends 
based on information known at december   we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our self insurance exposure 
as of december  and december   self insurance reserves were million and million  respectively  and were included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and canada 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
the accounting standard on income taxes contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

table of contents lease obligations we lease our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks and support centers 
each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon bakery cafe sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in bakery cafes where we pay contingent rent 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for non structural tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in accrued expenses or deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheets based on their short term or long term nature 
these landlord allowances are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related reasonably assured lease term 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each bakery cafe and fresh dough facility is amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the accounting standard for share based payment  which requires us to measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method 
we maintain several stock based incentive plans under which we may grant incentive stock options  non statutory stock options and stock settled appreciation rights  referred to collectively as option awards  to certain directors  officers  employees and consultants 
we also may grant restricted stock and restricted stock units and we offer a stock purchase plan through which employees may purchase our class a common stock each calendar quarter through payroll deductions at percent of market value on the purchase date and we recognize compensation expense on the percent discount 
for option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  while restricted stock is valued using the closing stock price on the date of grant 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the estimate of the following expected term the expected term of the option awards represents the period of time between the grant date of the option awards and the date the option awards are either exercised or canceled  including an estimate for those option awards still outstanding  and is derived from historical terms and other factors 
expected volatility the expected volatility is based on an average of the historical volatility of our stock price  for a period approximating the expected term  and the implied volatility of externally traded options of our stock that were entered into during the period 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and with a maturity that approximates the option awards expected term 
dividend yield the dividend yield is based on our anticipated dividend payout over the expected term of the option awards 

table of contents additionally  we use historical experience to estimate the expected forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation expense for these awards 
changes in these assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the awards is amortized over the vesting period 
option awards and restricted stock generally vest ratably over a four year period beginning two years from the date of grant and option awards generally have a six year term 
contractual obligations and other commitments we currently anticipate to system wide bakery cafe openings in fiscal we expect to fund our capital expenditures principally through internally generated cash flow and available borrowings under our existing credit facility  if needed 
in addition to our planned capital expenditure requirements  we have certain other contractual and committed cash obligations 
our contractual cash obligations consist of noncancelable operating leases for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks  and support centers  purchase obligations primarily for certain commodities  and uncertain tax positions 
lease terms for our trucks are generally for six to eight years 
lease terms for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities  and support centers are generally for ten years with renewal options at most locations and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
many bakery cafe leases provide for contingent rental ie percentage rent payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
as of december   we expect cash expenditures under these lease obligations  purchase obligations  and uncertain tax positions to be as follows for the fiscal periods indicated in thousands total in after operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our operating leases 
relates to certain commodity and service agreements where we are committed as of december  to purchase a fixed quantity over a contracted time period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we guaranteed operating leases of franchisee bakery cafes and four locations of our former au bon pain division  or its franchisees  which we account for in accordance with the accounting guidance for guarantees 
these leases have terms expiring on various dates from january  to december  and have a potential amount of future rental payments of approximately million as of december  the obligation from these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
we have not recorded a liability for certain of these guarantees as they arose prior to the implementation of the accounting requirements for guarantees and  unless modified  are exempt from its requirements 
we have not recorded a liability for those guarantees issued after the effective date of the accounting requirements because the fair value of each such lease guarantee was determined by us to be insignificant based on analysis of the facts and circumstances of each such lease and each such franchisee s performance  and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any guarantees at the time the guarantees were issued 
we have not had to make any payments related to any of these guaranteed leases 
au bon pain or the applicable franchisees continue to have primary liability for these operating leases 
as of december   future commitments under these leases were as follows in thousands total in after subleases and lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our operating leases 

table of contents employee commitments we have confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements  referred to as non compete agreements  with certain employees 
these non compete agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by us as specified in the non compete agreement 
we have not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  we will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee in accordance with the appropriate authoritative literature 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these non compete agreements was million 
related party credit agreement in order to facilitate the opening of the first panera bread bakery cafes in canada  on september   our canadian subsidiary  panera bread ulc  as lender  entered into a cdn 
million secured revolving credit facility agreement with millennium bread inc  or millennium  as borrower  and certain of millennium s present and future subsidiaries  which we refer to as franchisee guarantors  who have entered into franchise agreements with panera bread ulc to operate three panera bread bakery cafes in canada 
covenants under the credit agreement require millennium to maintain a certain level of cash equity contributions or subordinated loans from its shareholders in relation to the principal outstanding under the credit agreement 
the borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the per annum rate of percent  calculated daily and payable monthly in arrears on the last business day of each of panera bread ulc s fiscal month 
the credit facility  which is collateralized by present and future property and assets of millennium and the franchisee guarantors  as well as the personal guarantees of certain individuals  became due on september  on september  the maturity date was extended to december   on december  the maturity date was extended to february   and on february  the maturity date was extended to march  the credit facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default  including breaches of representations or covenants  failure to pay other material indebtedness or a change of control of millennium  as defined in the credit agreement 
the proceeds from the credit facility may be used by millennium to pay costs and expenses to develop and construct the franchisee guarantors bakery cafes and for their day to day operating requirements 
as part of the franchise agreement between millennium and panera bread ulc  panera bread ulc developed and equipped three bakery cafes as typical panera bread bakery cafes in accordance with our then current design and construction standards and specifications as applied by panera bread ulc  in its sole discretion 
millennium was required to pay panera bread ulc an amount equal to the total cost of development of the bakery cafes  which included any and all costs and expenses incurred by panera bread ulc in connection with selection and development of the bakery cafes  excluding overhead expenses of panera bread ulc 
on september   october   and december   panera bread ulc delivered possession of the three bakery cafes in canada to millennium  which bakery cafes subsequently opened on october   november   and january   respectively 
the total development cost billed to millennium for these three bakery cafes was approximately cdn 
million 
on april   millennium requested a cdn 
million advance under the credit agreement  which was applied against the outstanding receivable as previously described 
the remaining cdn 
million receivable was resolved during fiscal the cdn 
million note receivable from millennium is included in other accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  impact of inflation our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food  supply  labor  occupancy and other costs 
in the past  we have been able to recover a significant portion of inflationary costs and commodity price increases  including  among other things  fuel  proteins  dairy  wheat  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on our net income have not been materially adverse 
however  the volatility recently experienced in fiscal in certain commodity markets  such as those for wheat  fuel  and proteins  such as chicken or turkey  may have an adverse effect on us in the future 
the extent of the impact will depend on our ability and timing to increase food prices 
a majority of our associates are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although we have and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  we have not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins 

table of contents accounting standards issued not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets  which is effective for reporting periods beginning after november  this new guidance limits the circumstances in which a financial asset may be de recognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset 
the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers  is removed by this new guidance 
we expect that the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for variable interest entities  referred to as vie  which is effective for reporting periods beginning after november  and changes the process for how an enterprise determines which party consolidates a vie  to a primarily qualitative analysis 
the party that consolidates the vie the primary beneficiary is defined as the party with the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly affect the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie 
upon adoption  reporting enterprises must reconsider their conclusions on whether an entity should be consolidated and should a change result  the effect on net assets will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
we expect that the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we manage our commodity risk in several ways 
on occasion  we have entered into swap agreements to manage our fluctuating butter prices 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
in fiscal and  we did not have any derivative instruments 
in addition  we purchase certain commodities  such as flour  coffee and proteins  for use in our business 
these commodities are sometimes purchased under agreements of one month to one year time frames usually at a fixed price 
as a result  we are subject to market risk that current market prices may be above or below our contractual price 
interest rate sensitivity we are also exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides for a million secured facility under which we may select interest rates equal to the base rate which is defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus percent or libor plus an applicable rate ranging from percent to percent as set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement 
we did not have an outstanding balance on our borrowings at december  we may have future borrowings under our credit facility  which could result in an interest rate change that may have an impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expanded our operations into canadian markets by opening two franchise operated bakery cafes 
we opened one additional bakery cafe in canada in the first quarter of fiscal our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar  in which our operating obligations in canada are paid 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future
