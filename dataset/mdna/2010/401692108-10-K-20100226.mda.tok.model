item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we develop and provide the leading software solutions for digital investigations  including encase enterprise  a network enabled product primarily for corporations and government agencies  and encase forensic  a desktop based product primarily for law enforcement agencies and digital investigators 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in from through  we generated a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of our encase forensic products and related services 
we 
table of contents have experienced increases in our revenue as a result of the release of our encase enterprise products in late  which expanded our customer base into corporate enterprises and federal government agencies 
in addition  the releases of our encase ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance solution in late which was replaced by our encase cybersecurity solution in have increased our average transaction size 
we anticipate that sales of our encase enterprise products and related services  in particular our encase ediscovery and encase cybersecurity solutions  will comprise a substantial portion of our future revenues 
important factors affecting our results of operations there are a number of trends that may affect our business and our industry 
we have identified factors that we expect to play an important role in our future growth and profitability 
some of these trends or other factors include legislative and regulatory developments 
our digital investigation solutions allow law enforcement agencies  government organizations and corporations to conduct investigations within the legal and regulatory framework 
historically  the implementation of new laws and regulations surrounding digital investigations has helped create demand for our products 
future changes in applicable laws or regulations could enhance or detract from the desirability of our products 
information technology budgets 
deployment of our solutions may require a substantial capital expenditure by our customers 
budgets for information technology related capital expenditures at corporations and all levels of government organizations are typically cyclical in nature  with generally higher budgets in times of improving economic conditions and lower budgets in times of economic slowdowns 
law enforcement agency budgets 
we sell our encase forensic products and training services primarily to law enforcement agencies 
because of the limited nature of law enforcement budgets  funds are typically initially allocated toward solving issues perceived to be the most pressing 
sales of our products could be impacted by changes in the budgets of law enforcement agencies or in the relative priority assigned to digital law enforcement investigations 
prevalence and impact of hacking incidents and spread of malicious software 
the increasing sophistication of hacking attacks on government and private networks and the global spread of malicious software  such as viruses  worms and rootkits  have increased the focus of corporations and large government organizations on digital investigations and other aspects of network security  which has  in turn  increased demand for our products 
future changes in the number and severity of such attacks or the spread of malicious software could have an effect on the demand for our products 
seasonality in revenues 
we experience seasonality in our revenues  with the third and fourth quarters typically having the highest revenues for the year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from our customers budgeting cycles 
the federal government budget year ends in the third calendar quarter of the year and a majority of corporate budget years end in the fourth calendar quarter of the year 
in addition  our customers also tend to make software purchases near the end of a particular quarter  which tends to make our revenues for a particular period unpredictable for a significant portion of that period 
we expect that this seasonality within particular years and unpredictability within particular quarterly periods will continue for the foreseeable future 
amount of commercial litigation 
because commercial litigation often involves ediscovery  an increase in commercial litigation could increase demand for our products and services  while a decrease in commercial litigation could decrease demand 
summary of results of operations our total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from last fiscal year 
product revenue was million for the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents  a decrease of million  or  from last fiscal year 
services and maintenance revenue was million for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from last fiscal year 
the decrease in our revenue was primarily due to the overall economic environment  and the resulting decreases in and or postponements of it spending by our customers 
sales to our government customers were also impacted by the delay in approval of the federal budget 
our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for last fiscal year 
our profitability is primarily dependent upon revenue from sales of our software solutions 
profitability is also affected by the costs and expenses associated with developing our software 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or  in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily the result of cost reductions and lower sales of products 
operating expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to  due primarily to the reduction in headcount and reduced general and administrative costs 
during fiscal year  we launched encase portable  a data acquisition solution that enables customers to leverage the search and acquisition capabilities of encase software in a wide range of field applications through the use of a portable device 
we also launched encase cybersecurity  which provides the ability to identify and analyze undiscovered threats  such as polymorphic or metamorphic malware  and other advanced hacking techniques that evade traditional network or host based defenses and includes investigative capabilities that target confidential or sensitive data and risk mitigation by remediating sensitive data from unauthorized locations 
sources of revenue our sales transactions typically include the following elements a software license fee paid for the use of our products under a perpetual license term  or for a specific term  an arrangement for first year support and maintenance  which includes unspecified software updates  upgrades and post contract support  and professional services for installation  implementation  consulting and training 
we derive the majority of our revenues from sales of our software products 
we sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force and in some cases we utilize resellers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc software industry revenue recognition topic asc  which  if revenues are to be recognized upon product delivery  requires among other things vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for each undelivered element of multiple element customer contracts

table of contents product revenues we generate product revenues principally from two product categories encase enterprise and encase forensic 
in  we redefined the categories that made up our product revenues 
our encase enterprise now includes perpetual licenses and pay per use fees related to our ediscovery  legal hold  data audit policy enforcement  encase cybersecurity and oem add on products 
encase forensic now includes revenues related to encase portable  neutrino mobile forensic device  field intelligence model and our premium license support program product  which is sold on a subscription basis for a term of one or three years 
in addition  we sell third party forensic hardware as a convenience to our customers  which comprises other product revenue 
in prior years  other had previously included oem  neutrino and field intelligence model 
for comparability purposes  we have restated and segments as defined above  however total product revenues remains unchanged as a result of the reclassification 
during the first two quarters of each fiscal year  we typically experience our lowest levels of product sales due to the seasonal budgetary cycles of our customers 
the third quarter is typically the strongest quarter for sales to our federal government customers 
typically  sales to our corporate customers are highest in the fourth quarter 
product revenues decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to a million reduction in encase enterprise license revenues 
we believe the decrease in encase enterprise license revenue was due to the depressed economic environment and the resulting negative impact on customers it purchases and the delay of government deals which were contingent upon final approval of the new fiscal year federal budget 
encase forensic revenue decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in for forensic revenue is attributable to reduced spending by state and local government agencies  as well as law enforcement and other federal agencies 
product revenues increased by million  or  in over  with that growth driven by a million revenue increase from our encase forensic product line and million increase from our encase enterprise product line 
the increase in forensic revenue is attributable to a larger number of governmental contracts completed during encase enterprise revenue grew as a result of increased market penetration and the introduction of our ediscovery product pay per use pricing during the second half of services and maintenance revenues services and maintenance revenues decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to and increased million compared to revenue for the professional services segment decreased by million  or  compared to prior fiscal year 
professional services revenue was impacted by the reduced demand for both implementation services and ediscovery services as a result of the decline in sales compared to the prior years 
training services revenue decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to the prior fiscal year  due to reductions in our customers travel and training budgets during the economic downturn 
maintenance and other revenue increased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to  and million compared to  as a result of the overall increase in our installed product base and a high annual renewal rate by customers desiring continuing maintenance support on our products 

table of contents cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change cost of product revenues cost of services and maintenance revenues professional services training maintenance and other total cost of services and maintenance revenues total cost of revenues share based compensation included above cost of product revenues cost of services and maintenance revenues gross margin percentage products services and maintenance total cost of product revenues cost of software product revenues consists principally of the cost of producing and distributing our software  including the cost of compact discs  packaging  shipping  customs duties  and  to a lesser extent  compensation and related overhead expenses 
while these costs are primarily variable with respect to sales volumes  they remain very low in relation to the revenues generated and result in higher gross margins than our services and training businesses 
our gross margins can be affected by product mix  as our encase enterprise products are generally higher margin products than our encase forensic products 
cost of product revenues decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  and remained flat with the decrease in was a result of reduced custom duty and shipping costs due to electronic delivery of product and reduced cost of printed materials 
product gross margin decreased slightly to in from in due to the introduction of encase portable and a higher mix of forensic versus enterprise sales 
cost of services and maintenance revenues the costs of professional services and training revenues are largely comprised of employee compensation  including share based compensation  related overhead expenses  and travel and facilities costs 
the cost of maintenance revenue is primarily outsourced  but also includes employee compensation costs for customer technical support and related overhead costs 
total cost of services and maintenance revenues decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  and million  or  compared to this reduction in cost of services and maintenance revenues is due to an overall decline in services and maintenance revenues and lower headcount 
in  we reduced headcount in our professional services division which increased gross margins 
in  headcount and related expenses of our professional services division were higher which resulted in lower gross margins 

table of contents overall  services and maintenance gross margin increased to from in  and in the year over year increase in maintenance revenues has resulted in a higher mix of maintenance revenues when compared to total revenues increasing from in to in and in the gross margin on maintenance and other revenue increased to from approximately in the prior two years due to continued high renewal rates with our existing customer base and lower costs associated with maintenance renewals

selling and marketing expenses also include expenses relating to advertising  brand building  marketing promotions and trade show events net of amounts received from sponsors and participants  product management  travel and allocated overhead 
although we expense our sales commissions at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client  revenues from our encase enterprise term licenses  encase forensic product  premium license support program  neutrino  the annual training passport  and our consulting  maintenance and implementation services are recognized over the relevant performance or license period 
accordingly  we generally experience a delay between when we experience increased selling and marketing expenses and when we recognize a portion of the corresponding revenue 
we employed approximately sales and marketing personnel at the end of  at the end of and at the end of selling and marketing expenses in decreased million  or  compared to  and increased million  or  compared to the change in expense is a result of the fluctuations in headcount year over year  as well as the variability in sales commission expense associated with the increase or decrease in product revenue 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation  including share based compensation  and related overhead expenses 
in order to develop new product offerings  continue developing existing products and improve quality assurance  we increased the number of research and development personnel that we employ to in from in and in research and development expenses increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  and increased  or  compared to the higher expenses were driven primarily by increases in headcount and other employee related expenses and the number of products in development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related costs for accounting  legal  information systems  human resources and other administrative functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional service fees  bad debt expense  other corporate expenses and related overhead 
as a result of process efficiencies and automation  we decreased the number of general and administrative personnel that we employ to in from in  and remained comparable to headcount levels in general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to  and million  or  compared to the decline was attributable to lower headcount and related expenses  reduction in legal expenses  audit  tax and sarbanes oxley costs due to the implementation of a new erp system and lower bad debt expense compared to the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of our leasehold improvements  furniture and computer hardware and software

see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition since inception  we have largely financed our operations from our cash flow from operations 
in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  for net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
changes in cash flow we generate cash from operations primarily from cash collections related to the sale of our products and services 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with net cash provided by operations of million in  and million in the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of an million decrease in accounts receivable in  compared to a million increase in accounts receivable in and a million increase in also impacting the cash provided by operations was an increase in depreciation and amortization  offset by a lower increase in deferred revenue  lower share based compensation and a larger loss in as compared to the decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to lower sales and higher cash collections in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year are our strongest quarters for cash collections  a consequence of the higher sales volumes typically experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
net cash used by investing activities decreased to million in from million in due to a decrease in capital expenditures in capital expenditures during included the purchase of our new erp system 
in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash due to the maturities of short term investments 
we presently expect capital expenditures to be between million to million in  which we expect to fund from operating cash flows 
net cash used by financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in cash used by financing activities in included million of repurchases and withholdings of common stock  lower proceeds from stock option exercises and lower principal payments on our capital lease obligations compared to and we maintain a million revolving line of credit with a bank  which expires on april  borrowings under this line of credit would be collateralized by substantially all our assets 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit 
we maintain a million revolving line of credit with a bank  which expires on april  borrowings under this line of credit would be collateralized by substantially all our assets 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit 
the line requires that we maintain certain financial covenants  and at june  we were in breach of the covenant that prohibited a cumulative net loss excluding non cash share based compensation in excess of million during any one fiscal year 
in july  we executed an amendment to the credit agreement with our bank  which increased the maximum allowable cumulative net loss under the covenant to million excluding non cash share based compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year  and million for any subsequent fiscal quarter 
the amendment also included a waiver of the covenant for the period ended june  in addition  borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by us a rate equal to the bank s alternate base rate plus or the bank s libor plus 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the revolving line of credit 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we currently have no material cash commitments  except our normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and leases  all of which are currently expected to be funded through existing working capital and future cash flows from operations 
at december   our outstanding contractual cash commitments were largely limited to our non cancelable lease obligations  primarily relating to office facilities  as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations  including interest non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our selling and marketing activities  the timing and extent of research and development spending to support product development and enhancement efforts  costs associated with expansion into new territories or markets  the timing of the introduction of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash from operations  or the availability of cash under our line of credit  are insufficient to fund our future activities and planned growth  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
furthermore  although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation or foreign exchange markets on our operations  we do not believe these external economic forces have had  or are likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k 
we do not have material relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed in this report 
stock repurchases in august  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
under the authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors  such as levels of cash generation from operations  market conditions and our share price 
repurchased shares are held in treasury stock and have not been retired 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining under this authorization 
in addition to the shares we have repurchased on the open market  we withheld approximately  and  common shares in and  respectively  from employees to satisfy their personal income tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of share awards issued under our equity compensation plans during the quarter 
withheld shares are held in treasury stock and have not been retired 
the company may engage in similar transactions from time to time related to future vesting of employee restricted stock awards 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of 
table of contents certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below and in note to our consolidated financial statements  included herein at item  have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider them to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
there have been no significant changes in those critical accounting policies and estimates during the twelve months ended december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc software industry revenue recognition topic asc 
while the standard governs the basis for revenue recognition  in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue should be recognized currently and which portions  if any  should be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
in general  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable  as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement if we either enter into contracts or receive written purchase orders issued by a customer that legally bind us and the customer  we consider that as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery we deem delivery of products to have occurred when the title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we have a reasonable basis to expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue reported 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total purchase price irrespective of invoiced allocations among the various elements we deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
the vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
if we were to change our pricing practices or any of our other assumptions or judgments in the future  our future revenue recognition could differ significantly from our historical results 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements when revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 

table of contents product revenue 
the timing of product revenue recognition is dependent on the nature of the product sold 
product arrangements comprising multiple deliverables  including software and hardware  are generally categorized into one of the following encase enterprise  encase ediscovery  and related products license revenue associated with these arrangements  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance and other undelivered elements for which we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
encase forensic license revenue from corporate customers  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance  for which we have vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
because maintenance is included at no additional cost in governmental forensic arrangements  vsoe of fair value for the maintenance element for governmental customers is indeterminable  so we allocate governmental forensic product  services and maintenance revenue ratably over the longer of the contractual maintenance period months or the implied maintenance period typically  the longer of months or product life based on estimated fair values of the various components 
premium license support program solutions the premium license support program is a subscription arrangement entitling customers to receive unspecified future products and post contract customer support for a period of several years 
revenue resulting from premium license support program arrangements is recognized ratably over the contractual period beginning with the delivery of the first product 
encase neutrino our mobile device investigative solution is sold to forensic customers with a related subscription covering future adapters for newly issued cell phones 
revenue is recognized over the related subscription period 
for enterprise customers  encase neutrino revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
standard maintenance is charged to entitle customers to future cell phone adapters on an if and when available basis 
hardware revenue associated with the sale of hardware is recognized upon shipment to the customer  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
services and maintenance revenue 
services and maintenance revenue consists of professional services  training  and maintenance 
revenue from such services is generally recognized as the services are provided 
training revenues are either recognized on a per class basis upon a participant s attendance or  for those customers who have subscribed to our annual training passport program  revenue is recognized ratably over the annual period 
we refer to revenue related to technical product support and software updates on a when and if available basis as maintenance revenue  which is recognized ratably over the applicable contractual period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to substantive maintenance renewal provisions contained in each arrangement 
we consider substantive maintenance provisions to be provisions where the cost of the maintenance renewal  stated in the contract with our customer as a percentage of the product fee  is comparable to the normal pricing for maintenance only renewals 
substantially all of our customers purchase maintenance support when they acquire new software licenses and substantially all renew their maintenance support contracts annually or otherwise 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the compensation stock compensation asc topic and recognize share based compensation expense for all share based awards granted 
prior to the adoption of compensation stock compensation  we used the minimum value method for disclosure purposes 
since all options granted prior to january  were granted at exercise prices that were equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no share based compensation for stock options was recorded in the accompanying financial statements prior to and we are not required to record compensation expense for 
table of contents stock options granted prior to january  unless the terms of those options are subsequently modified 
since adoption  we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based awards granted after january  using the prospective transition method 
under that transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
with the exception of one option granted in december with market based vesting conditions  which is discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of share based payments and recognize that cost  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based awards using that model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the estimated number of years that we expect employees to hold their stock options the option term and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividends to be paid on our stock over that term 
the expected term life of stock option awards has been calculated using the simplified method because we lack sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
we lack this historical data because of two factors first  our equity incentive plan the plan was adopted in and we do not have a sufficient history of exercises and forfeitures over the typical year life of our awards to predict future option holder behavior  which is critical in estimating an expected term for our options  and  second  we believe that our december initial public offering has likely changed the historical patterns that were experienced during the brief period of time from the plan s adoption to our initial public offering 
the volatility of our common stock is estimated at the date of grant based on a weighted average of the implied volatility of publicly traded day to day options on the common stock of a select peer group of similar companies similar companies  the historical volatility of the common stock of similar companies and  beginning in late  the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate used in option valuation is based on the implied yield in effect at the time of each option grant  based on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent expected terms 
we use a dividend yield of zero in the black scholes model  as we have no intention to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
compensation stock compensation also requires that we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can potentially have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if we change the terms of our employee share based compensation programs  refine future assumptions or if we change to other acceptable valuation models  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from historical trends and could materially affect our results of operations 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to record approximately million in share based compensation in related to options and restricted stock awards outstanding at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is established through a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  through consideration of the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
in addition  we analyze our historical credit loss history and apply these loss rates to our current accounts receivable balances to verify the reasonableness of our allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in the future  which would result in increased general and administrative expense 

table of contents accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities will be established if necessary 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can significantly impact our effective tax rate 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for tax contingencies 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies and commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of contingencies asc 
if management determines that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we record an accrued liability and an expense for the estimated loss

table of contents non audit services of independent registered public accounting firm our audit committee of the board of directors has pre approved all non audit services including tax compliance services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in the financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  and therefore  the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but historically have had relatively little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
in the future  an increased portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio  consisting of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government at december   is subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio
