item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the electronic manufacturing services ems segment and the furniture segment 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to the medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety industries 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under the company s family of brand names 
within both segments  most of the markets in which the company competes were adversely affected by the global recession and liquidity crisis 
the recession first began to impact the company s sales and order trends in the second quarter of fiscal year the ems segment has rebounded quicker than the furniture segment with june  open orders higher than june  and similar to the open order levels in the ems segment prior to the declines the company experienced related to the global recession 
furniture segment open orders as of june  approximated the june  level 
while open orders in the furniture segment are down significantly from the levels experienced prior to the impact of the global recession  the june  open orders increased from the level for the most recent quarter ended march  after experiencing sales declines in calendar year  the ems industry sales projections by idc  inforum  and electronic trend publications show average forecasted growth for calendar year in the range of to compared to calendar year in addition  the semiconductor industry association sia reported that semiconductor sales are projected to grow approximately in calendar year  and although the company does not directly serve this market  it may be indicative of increased end market demand for products utilizing electronic components 
the company continues its strategy of diversification within the ems segment customer base as it currently focuses on the four key vertical markets of medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety 
short term demand in the automotive market improved during the first half of the company s fiscal year in conjunction with the federal cash for clunkers tax rebate program 
automotive activity in the latter half of fiscal year remained strong with activity projected to moderate in fiscal year due to the impact of current economic conditions on durable goods spending 
demand in the medical market has remained stable  and the company sees signs of growth 
the industrial control market is also showing signs of stability  after benefiting from spending targeted at energy savings technologies  and the public safety market is likewise stable 
sales to customers in the medical industry are the largest portion of the company s ems segment with sales to customers in the automotive industry being the second largest of the four vertical markets 
the company s sales to customers in the automotive industry are diversified among more than ten domestic and foreign customers and represented approximately of the ems segment s net sales for fiscal year the amount of sales of electronic components that relate to general motors  ford  and chrysler automobiles sold in north america were only approximately of the company s ems segment net sales during fiscal year as of august  the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma projected a year over year increase in the office furniture industry for calendar year after a industry decline in calendar year bifma projects office furniture industry growth of approximately in calendar year while the company s mid market brand has fared better than its contract office furniture brand due to the project nature of the contract market and the changing us consumption patterns  the company cannot predict future overall office furniture order trends at this time due to the short lead time of orders and the volatility in this market 
in addition  the hotel industry forecasts reported by smith travel research and pricewaterhousecoopers llp project occupancy rates to increase approximately in calendar year after a industry decline in calendar year and project revenue per available room to increase less than for calendar year after a industry decline in calendar year although the company s recent hospitality order rates have improved  the company cannot predict if this activity will be sustained in the near term 
competitive pricing pressures within the ems segment and on many projects within the furniture segment continue to put pressure on the company s operating margins 
the company is continually assessing its strategies in relation to market conditions 
a long standing component of the company s profit sharing incentive bonus plan is that it is linked to the performance of the company which automatically lowers total compensation expense when profits are down 
during fiscal year  the company also maintained its focus on reducing operating costs  more closely scrutinizing customer and supply chain risk  and deferring or cancelling capital expenditures that were not immediately required to support customer requirements 
the company will continue to closely monitor market changes and its liquidity in order to proactively adjust its operating costs  discretionary capital spending  and dividend levels as needed 
the company continued to maintain a strong balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year  which included a minimal amount of long term debt of million and share owners equity of million 
the company s short term liquidity available  represented as cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments plus the unused amount of the company s revolving credit facility  was million at june  in addition to the above risks related to the current market conditions  management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding the company s financial condition and operating performance the company will continue its focus on preserving cash and minimizing debt 
managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is key 
in addition  the company plans to minimize capital expenditures where appropriate but has been and will continue to invest in capital expenditures for projects that would enhance the company s capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability as the economy and the company s markets recover 
commodity price pressure is expected to continue in the near term 
mitigating the impact of higher commodity and fuel prices continues to be an area of focus within the company 
management continues to evaluate the healthcare reform legislation that was signed into law in march to understand the full impact on the company 
this legislation is expected to increase the company s healthcare and related administrative expenses 
globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which the company operates but also its key customers and competitors 
as demand within the ems industry increases  the availability of components used in products manufactured by the company is a concern 
as suppliers have not increased their production as rapidly as demand has increased  component shortages are occurring 
if shortages of components continue or worsen  the company s production and shipment schedules could be impacted 
the nature of the ems industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently 
the company s sales to bayer ag are expected to begin to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the company s manufacturing contract with bayer ag reaches end of life 
margins on the bayer ag product are generally lower than the company s other ems products 
the success of the company s ems segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
while the margins vary depending on the size of the program and the vertical market being served  replacement programs generally require more competitive pricing 
thus the company must strive to identify cost savings opportunities to offset the lower pricing 
see 
item a risk factors for more information on the risks related to contract customers 
successful execution of the company s restructuring plans is critical to the company s future performance 
the success of the restructuring initiatives is dependent on accomplishing the plans in a timely and effective manner 
the company s restructuring plans are discussed in the segment discussions below 
the increasingly competitive marketplace mandates that the company continually re evaluate its business models 
the company s employees throughout its business operations are an integral part of the company s ability to compete successfully  and the stability of its management team is critical to long term share owner value 
the company s career development and succession planning process helps to maintain stability in management 
as end markets dictate  the company is continually assessing under utilized capacity and developing plans to grow its customer base and better utilize manufacturing operations  including shifting manufacturing capacity to lower cost venues as appropriate 
o during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a restructuring plan to consolidate production of select office furniture manufacturing departments 
the consolidation is complete and has reduced manufacturing costs and excess capacity by eliminating redundant property and equipment  processes  and employee costs 
o during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a plan to expand its european automotive electronics capabilities and to establish a european medical center of expertise near poznan  poland which is expected to improve the company s margins in the very competitive ems market 
the company previously had one operation in poznan 
construction of a new  larger facility in poland is complete and limited production has begun 
the company successfully completed the move of production from longford  ireland  into the existing poznan facility during the second quarter of fiscal year as part of the plan  the company is also consolidating its ems facilities located in wales  united kingdom  and poznan  poland into the new facility near poznan  with a projected final completion of the consolidation by mid fiscal year to support growth and diversification efforts  the company has focused on both organic growth and potential acquisition targets 
acquisitions allow rapid diversification of both customers and industries served 
the regulatory and business environment for us public companies requires that the company continually evaluate and enhance its practices in the areas of corporate governance and management practices 
the company has taken a number of steps to conform its corporate governance to evolving national and industry wide best practices among us public companies  not only to comply with new legal requirements  but also to enhance the decision making process and effectiveness of the company s board of directors 
certain preceding statements could be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers  or similar unforeseen events

consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to for fiscal year from in fiscal year due to a shift in sales mix as depicted in the table below toward the ems segment which operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the furniture segment 
the ems segment and furniture segment gross profit as a percent of net sales both improved in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions below 
segment net sales as a of consolidated net sales year ended june ems segment furniture segment fiscal year consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased slightly as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal year  due to sales volumes declining at a quicker rate than the selling and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses for fiscal year declined in absolute dollars by compared to fiscal year primarily due to decreased labor expense  lower bad debt expense  lower depreciation and amortization expense  and other comprehensive cost reduction efforts throughout the company 
partially offsetting these reductions  the company experienced increased employee benefit costs primarily related to the reinstatement of the company s retirement plan contribution  increased advertising and marketing costs  and increased incentive compensation costs at select business units during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in addition  in fiscal year  the company recorded million of expense compared to million of income in fiscal year related to the normal revaluation to fair value of its supplemental employee retirement plan serp liability 
the result was an unfavorable variance in selling and administrative expenses of million 
as the general equity markets improved  the value of the serp investments increased  causing additional selling and administrative expense related to the serp liability 
the serp expense recorded in selling and administrative expenses was exactly offset by an increase in serp investment income which was recorded in other income expense as an investment gain  therefore  there was no effect on net earnings 
the serp investment is comprised of approximately employee contributions

the company is leasing a portion of the facility until it completes the transfer of production to its newly constructed facility in poland 
fiscal year other general income also included million of pre tax income recorded in the ems segment resulting from settlement proceeds related to an antitrust class action lawsuit of which the company was a class member 
the class action alleged the defendant sellers illegally conspired to fix prices for electronic components purchased by a business unit within the ems segment 
other general income in fiscal year included a million pre tax gain on the sale of undeveloped land holdings and timberlands 
the gain on the sale of land holdings and timberlands was included in unallocated corporate in segment reporting 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company had a conditional agreement to sell and lease back the facility that housed its poland operations 
however  the buyer was unable to close the transaction 
as a result  the company was entitled to retain approximately million of the deposit funds held by the company which was recorded as pre tax income in other general income in the ems segment 
in fiscal year  the company recorded non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charges of million as a result of interim goodwill impairment testing which was completed due to the uncertainty associated with the economy and the significant decline in the company s sales and order trends during fiscal year as well as the increased disparity between the company s market capitalization and the carrying value of its share owners equity 
the goodwill was related to prior acquisitions in both of the company s segments

the fiscal year effective tax rate was compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year of 
relatively low pre tax income coupled with a tax benefit due to the company s tax planning strategy related to the sale of its poland facility and land and the favorable impact of the company s earnings mix resulted in a tax benefit in fiscal year despite the company s pre tax income

at june   the company had million in letters of credit against the million credit facility 
total availability to borrow under the million credit facility was million at june  the company maintains the million credit facility with an expiration date in april that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings 
the million credit facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to million at the company s request  subject to the consent of the participating banks 
the million credit facility  upon which there were no borrowings at june   requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants including interest coverage ratio and minimum net worth 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at june  the company believes the most significant covenants under its million credit facility are minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio 
the table below compares the actual net worth and interest coverage ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement

the company believes its principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand  cash generated from operations  and the availability of borrowing under the company s credit facilities will be sufficient for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
one of the company s sources of funds has been its ability to generate cash from operations to meet its liquidity obligations  which during fiscal year was hampered by lower sales volumes and could also be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions  a decline in demand for the company s products  loss of key contract customers  the ability of the company to generate profits  and other unforeseen circumstances 
in particular  should demand for the company s products decrease significantly over the next months due to the weakened economy  the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted 
another source of funds is the company s credit facilities 
the million credit facility is contingent on complying with certain debt covenants

the company evaluated the inputs used to value the instruments and validated the accuracy of the instrument fair values based on historical evidence 
the company s foreign currency derivatives  which were classified as level assets liabilities  were independently valued using a financial risk management software package using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves  current spot rates  and time value calculations 
to verify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values  these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty banks 
the company s own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives 
the company invested in convertible promissory notes and stock warrants of a privately held company during fiscal year and has been chosen by the privately held company as its primary supplier to produce ems products in the future

the stock warrants  classified as derivative instruments  were valued on a recurring basis using a market based method which utilizes the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value measurements for the convertible promissory notes and stock warrants were calculated using unobservable inputs and were classified as level financial assets

service revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as sales while the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
the company recognizes sales net of applicable sales tax 
sales returns and allowances at the time revenue is recognized certain provisions may also be recorded  including a provision for returns and allowances  which involve estimates based on current discussions with applicable customers  historical experience with a particular customer and or product  and other relevant factors

at june  and june   the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the returns and allowances reserve approximated to of gross trade receivables during the past two fiscal years 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on a percentage of aged accounts receivable  where the percentage increases as the accounts receivable become older 
however  management judgment is utilized in the final determination of the allowance based on several factors including specific analysis of a customer s credit worthiness  changes in a customer s payment history  historical bad debt experience  and general economic and market trends 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
during the preceding two year period  this reserve had approximated of gross trade accounts receivable except for the period march through december during which time it approximated of gross trade accounts receivable 
the higher reserve was driven by increased risk created by deteriorating market conditions during that time

however  there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments due to minimum lot sizes and inventory lead time requirements  or where component allocation or other procurement issues may exist 
the company may also purchase additional inventory to support transfers of production between manufacturing facilities 
evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels  and product demand levels 
factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage  use as showroom samples  design changes  or cessation of product lines 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability  workers compensation  and certain employee health benefits such as medical  short term disability  and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors including known claims  estimated incurred but not reported claims  and other analyses  which are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june   the company s accrued liabilities for self insurance exposure were million and million  respectively 
taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company provides a valuation allowance based on its best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable 
future events could change management s assessment 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  the company believes it has made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit

annually  or if conditions indicate an interim review is necessary  the company compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to an estimate of the reporting unit s fair value to identify potential impairment 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to determine the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
if impaired  goodwill is written down to its estimated implied fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
the fair value is established primarily using a discounted cash flow analysis and secondarily a market approach utilizing current industry information 
the calculation of the fair value of the reporting units considers current market conditions existing at the assessment date 
in addition to performing the required annual testing  the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is warranted on an interim basis 
the company can provide no assurance that an impairment charge for the company s remaining goodwill balance  which approximates only of total assets  will not occur in future periods as a result of these analyses 
at june  and june   the company s goodwill  net of accumulated impairment losses  totaled million and million  respectively
