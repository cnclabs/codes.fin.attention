item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition for each of the two years ended june  and  respectively 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements and information 
the cautionary statements included below and elsewhere in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they may appear 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that are believed to be the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  warranty reserve  inventory valuations for slow moving items  impairment of goodwill  and the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
revenue recognition revenue on virtually all product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer based on its terms of fob shipping point  where the risk of loss and title transfer to the customer 
we record sales in accordance with asc formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when all of the following are satisfied persuasive evidence that a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
we sell some of our products with a warranty that provides for repairs or replacement of any defective parts for a period after the sale 
at the time of the sale  the company accrues an estimate of the cost of providing the warranty based on prior experience 
the company recognizes revenue under research and development agreements as certain deliverables are met as specified in each development contract 
there have been minimal returns for credit  so no reserve for product returns has been established 
inventory we determine our inventory value at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
we determine a reduced market value of our inventory based on the aging of inventory on hand 
we define aging of inventory as inventory that exceeds an estimated months of usage and exceeds orders on hand 
accounts receivable we determine the reserve for our accounts receivable by examining the aging of receivables 
we define aging of receivables as time passed since i the sale was completed  ii revenue was recognized and iii the receivable was established 
if the receivable is aged over days old  or has a known collection risk  it is reserved from anywhere between of its value up to of its value depending on account credit and collection history 
goodwill in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 intangible goodwill and other intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis during our fiscal fourth quarter  regardless if there is evidence or suspicion of impairment 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  the carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
in accordance with asc  a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit an intangible asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  goodwill assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
we identify two reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing arising from our acquisitions of micro motors and astromec our carson city reporting unit corresponds to the operations resulting from the astromec acquisition  our irvine reporting unit corresponds to the operations resulting from the micro motors acquisition 
in determining if a triggering event has occurred  we consider not only expectations for growth in the entire us economy  but also expectations for regional growth specific to our sales markets and specific to our industry and product lines 
while our operating units are influenced by changes in the general economic outlook of the united states  they are most heavily influenced by changes specific to the medical device industry 
furthermore  the magnitude of economic changes within the industry is viewed alongside the outlooks and forecasts specific to the reporting units to obtain a better sense of the likelihood that goodwill may be impaired 
declines within the industry s outlook are reflected in the unit s revenue projections 
during the preparation of the fiscal year financial statements  we determined a triggering event occurred for micro motors as new and replacement revenue sources for a potential loss of our largest customer had not been completed 
during the preparation of the fiscal year financial statements we also determined a triggering event for astromec as it became apparent that the expected product synergies and resulting financial benefits from the astromec acquisition were not being realized 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we considered the two traditional approaches to valuation  the market approach and the income discounted cash flow dcf approach 
the market approach compares the subject company with guideline publicly traded companies 
valuation multiples are calculated from the selected companies to provide an indication of how much a current investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company with similar characteristics 
the income approach measures the projected cash flows expected to be realized from the asset 
the value of a business is the expected cash flows discounted to a present value at a discount rate that considers the degree of risk associated with the realization of the projected monetary benefits 
the cash flow analysis relies upon estimates of the entity s future revenue and expenses to ultimately project the future cash flows resulting from the business activity of each entity 
an appropriate discount rate is reached by calculating the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  which is determined by the assumptions underlying the capital asset pricing model  or capm  and is considered to reflect the view of market participants  as required under asc formerly sfas 
the material assumptions relied upon in the analyses used to value the micro motors and astromec reporting units and goodwill are shown below 
astromec market approach a nine public companies were identified that had a range of revenue to value multiples of between times to a high of times with a median revenue multiple of 
b eleven similar open market transactions were identified that had revenue to value multiples that ranged from a low of to a high of with a median revenue multiple of c the low multiples were used to determine the fair value due to astromec s small size and profitability 
income approach a a discounted cash flow model was constructed using a ten year forecast for the reporting unit to determine a debt free cash flow forecast 
the present value of the cash flows and residual value were discounted to a present value using the wacc 
the inputs to the capm to determine the cost of equity used in the wacc were i 
risk free rate of ii 
relevered beta of iii 
equity risk premium of iv 
small cap stock premium of v 
reporting unit risk premium of the reporting unit s cost of equity was estimated to be b the cost of debt was based on moody s baa seasoned bond rate 
c based on the debt equity capital structure of the peer group of equity and debt  the wacc was estimated at 
micro motors market approach a ten public companies were identified that had a range of revenue to value multiples of between times to a high of times with a median revenue multiple of 
b eleven similar open market transactions were identified that had revenue to value multiples that ranged from a low of to a high of with a median revenue multiple of c the mean multiples were used to determine the fair value due to micro motor s size 
income approach a a discounted cash flow model was constructed using a ten year forecast for the reporting unit to determine a debt free cash flow forecast 
the present value of the cash flows and residual value were discounted to a present value using the wacc 
the inputs to the capm to determine the cost of equity used in the wacc were i 
risk free rate of ii 
relevered beta of iii 
equity risk premium of iv 
small cap stock premium of the reporting unit s cost of equity was estimated to be b the cost of debt was based on moody s baa seasoned bond rate 
c based on the debt equity capital structure of the peer group of equity and debt  the wacc was estimated at 
as the fair value of the equity was below the carrying value of the equity at both astromec and micro motors  the goodwill was considered impaired and a step analysis was required 
in the step two analysis  it was determined that all the remaining goodwill for these two reporting units was impaired 
goodwill impairment associated with astromec recognized as an operating expense was  goodwill impairment associated with micro motors recognized as an operating expense was  long lived assets in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal for long lived assets  we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
given the company s lack of a direct dental distribution channel  in fiscal year third quarter  it stopped actively promoting the intraosseous dental anesthesia delivery product intraflow that is based on the intangible asset resulting from the purchase of certain assets from intravantage  inc in october any substantial future value therefore is derived from the possibility that a company with a direct dental distribution channel a market participant might be interested in access to the technology through product purchases  licenses  acquisition  joint venture  or other means 
given the current economic environment  the general lack of investment in new products  the limited number of market participants to whom this technology relates  the time and expense necessary to consummate a transaction  and other factors considered by management  there is also a significant possibility that no distribution partner will be found  resulting in effectively no value of the asset 
given this change in circumstance  in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management tested the carrying amount of the intangible asset for recoverability as of march  the result of management s analysis based on several scenarios with varying probabilities of occurring was that the asset s value was impaired and  accordingly  a charge of  was taken in the fiscal third quarter 
as market conditions have not improved and no distribution partner has been found as of december   management concluded that the asset s value was further impaired and  accordingly  a charge for the remaining value of  was taken in the fiscal second quarter 
carrying value amortization impairment intangibles patents we determined a triggering event occurred with the carson city land and building the property due to the expected undiscounted cash flows being below the carrying value of the property  indicating impairment 
the fair value is defined pursuant to asc fair value measurements as the price that would be received in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value was estimated based on market conditions and comparable transactions 
carrying value depreciation impairment land building accumulated depreciation total land building  net warranties our warranty accrual is determined by reviewing the return rates and warranty repair costs for warranty eligible products 
we accrue an amount of expected repair cost based on these factors projected for the future applicable warranty period 
if actual return rates or repair costs differ from our estimates  actual results could vary from the projected accrual 
the repair return rates and cost assumptions are reviewed quarterly 
property  plant  equipment and leasehold improvements  net property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of the following audited audited land building leasehold improvements equipment total accumulated depreciation total property  plant equipment  net depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows building years  equipment to years  and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives 
as noted above  the value of the carson city land and building was revalued to its current market value in the land was reduced to  from  and the building was reduced to  from stock based compensation we are subject to asc formerly sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  as revised december this standard establishes the accounting standards for equity compensation  and applies to us in the recognition of the cost of stock options awarded based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant tax assets are future deductions from the amortization of intangibles over the next ten years  inventory reserves and net operating loss carry forwards 
tax assets also result from net operating losses and research and development tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax asset 
such determination is based primarily on our historical taxable income  with some consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we carry a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and changes in this allowance are reflected through income tax expense 
year in review proved to be a much better year for pro dex following the down year for the world s economy and pro dex in fiscal year our consolidated sales for grew by as compared to  bringing our five year cumulative average growth back to over per year 
over a longer term  we maintained a cumulative average growth rate of almost per year since fiscal year our medical products business resumed its growth in as sales were over higher than the previous year 
strong demand from our top two customers and a new product that we delivered to one of those customers drove the sales increase 
unfortunately  as discussed elsewhere in this report  in december we received notice from our largest customer that it is working to manufacture for itself the two products that we currently produce for the customer  potentially reducing our sales to them beginning in calendar year our motion control business was particularly adversely affected in as our high margin products associated with this business are used by capital equipment providers  and these orders slowed substantially in our third quarter january march 
in response to the unfavorable demand environment for these products  we sensed an opportunity to gain market share in the motion control marketplace and added additional sales resources in january to aggressively uncover and pursue new customer and new sales channel opportunities 
sales levels gradually increased through the year and ended at a run rate of approximately of the sales levels seen before the downturn 
our year end backlog of orders remained at the high end of the historical range at million  up from million at june and million at june the cost control efforts established in the prior years continued to show positive results 
our gross margin increased from in to of sales in  a level not seen since our reported operating costs in were million  up from million in  but as in  were clouded by non cash impairment charges 
these non cash charges totaled over million dollars in  consisting of we wrote off the remaining  of the patent intangible in december as no strategic distribution partner was found for the product line 
by the end of fiscal  it became apparent that the expected product synergies and resulting financial benefits from the astromec acquisition were not being realized 
as a result  we determined that the asset was impaired and wrote off million in goodwill associated with the acquisition 
we also realized the decline in market value of the carson city land and building and wrote down that asset s value by million 
in addition  due to the uncertain outlook of the medical device business related to the potential reduction in business from a major customer  the remaining million in goodwill from the acquisition of micro motors was determined to be impaired and written off 
included a  charge for writing down the majority of the value of the patent intangible 
without the impairment charges  operating expenses remained stable at million in and in we continue to have a full allowance on our million in deferred tax assets at the end of  up from million at the end of despite the reported loss  we significantly improved the company s financial position by generating over million in operating cash for the fiscal year  following the million generated in and million in our net debt balance of million from turned to a net cash balance of thousand as our cash balances exceeded our debt balances 
the cash generated was a result of normal ongoing operations generating over million in pre tax profitability in before consideration of the impairments 
we also benefited from a change in the tax law that allowed us to recover  in previously unavailable tax credits 
we continue to have nothing borrowed on our credit line and ended the year with approximately million in cash on hand 
results of operations results of operations for fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth financial data and the percentage of net revenues regarding the company s financial position and operating results 
in thousands fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses intangible and property value impairment research and development costs loss from operations net interest expense and net other income benefit for income taxes allowance for deferred tax asset net loss net sales 
consolidated sales increased or  to  from  for as compared to medical sales were higher by  or  due to higher sales to our largest customer of  as that customer continues to build inventory see note of the consolidated financial statements 
shipments to dental customers decreased by  or  as we strategically reduced sales of certain low profit products 
sales to industrial customers decreased by  or  reflecting a slowdown in our motion control business primarily in the first six months of fiscal year aerospace sales were up  or  due to higher commercial aircraft motor shipments 
sales related to government research related products and product repairs were down  due primarily to a decline in government agency related work 
although selective price increases and decreases were implemented in response to market conditions  the majority of the sales growth and declines for each product line is due primarily to changes in sales volume  not the effect of price changes 
the amount of pro dex total sales to each customer type and the year to year change is noted in the table below fiscal year ended june  increase sales by customer type decrease medical aerospace industrial dental government research and other total sales gross profit and gross profit percentage of sales 
our consolidated gross profit for increased  or compared to the gross profit in the previous year  due to the higher medical sales and improved industrial sales mix 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  gross margin as a percentage of sales was positively impacted as a more favorable sales mix comprised mostly of the increase higher margin medical products and the decrease in lower margin dental products 
gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were as follows fiscal year ended june  increase gross profit gross profit percentage of sales selling  general and administrative costs s  g a 
s  g a expenses including  and  intangible and property value impairment charges in and respectively increased to  for the year ended june  from  for year ended june  we had a increase in selling expense mainly due to increased promotion and advertising  and increased employee compensation 
general and administrative costs were higher by due to increases in employee compensation  offset by reduced consulting costs 
as a percentage of sales  s  g a costs increased to from for the year ended june  and  respectively

our consolidated operating loss for the year ended june  was  compared to an operating loss of  for the year ended june  operating loss as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  operating loss and operating loss as a percentage of sales were as follows fiscal year ended june  decrease operating loss operating loss percentage of sales royalties and other income 
we earned and received  in royalty payments in fiscal year  compared to  in royalty payments in the increase in was due to a single one time royalty termination payment of  we had no other expense during the years ended june  and net interest income expense 
net interest expense was  in the year ended june   which included  in interest expense offset by  in interest income  compared to  in the year ended june  which included  in interest expense offset by  in interest income 
the decrease in interest expense is due to reductions in the outstanding principal of our carson city real estate loan and five year term note 
we continue to carry no balance on our revolving credit line note 
fiscal year ended june  increase decrease debt related interest expense interest income net interest expense interest expense as a percentage of sales income tax provision 
our estimated effective combined federal and state tax rate on loss from operations for the year ended june  resulted in a benefit of loss before tax compared to a provision of loss before tax for the year ended june  the difference is due to the  valuation allowance against our current and long term deferred tax assets established in which resulted in a net  income tax provision during the fiscal year ended june  the valuation allowance was increased by  in  which partially offset the tax benefit from the loss before tax for the year 
the deferred tax valuation allowance is more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax assets result primarily from tax basis of intangible assets in excess of book basis 
each period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent a valuation allowance is either increased or decreased in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax asset 
such determination is based primarily on our historical taxable income  with some consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
due to cumulative losses during the past three years  we maintain a  valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of june  changes in the valuation allowance are recorded through income tax expense and included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
net loss we had a net loss of  or per share  basic  for the year ended june   compared to a net loss of  or per share  basic  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the periods indicated as of june  june  cash and cash equivalents working capital credit line outstanding balance tangible book value common share number of days of sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable at end of quarter year ended june  june  net cash provided by operations working capital ending current assets balance ending current liabilities balance tangible book value common share total shareholders equity net intangible asset patents goodwill basic outstanding shares dso ending net accounts receivable balance previous quarter sales our working capital at june  increased  to approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the increased working capital is due primarily to an increase in cash and equivalents of  offset by an increase in current liabilities of  compared to june  net cash provided by operations during fiscal year was  as compared to  during fiscal year fiscal year cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the net loss from operations of  offset by non cash items of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of  the non cash items consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization of  carson city land and building impairment of  carson city goodwill impairment of  micro motors goodwill impairment of  and the remaining intraflow patent impairment of  cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of  an increase in employee bonus accrual of  and an increase in warranty reserve of  included in the operating cash is a one time benefit from a change in the tax law that allowed us to recover  in previously unavailable tax credits 
management believes that our working capital needs over the next twelve months can be adequately supported by current operations 
potential reduction in large customer orders in december  our largest customer informed us that is was in the process of developing  and planned to eventually manufacture  its own surgical hand pieces which are functionally comparable to the two products currently provided to the customer by the company 
pro dex has been the exclusive manufacturer of these products since they were developed 
we currently provide the customer with two products product a and product b and repair services for such products 
total revenue shipped in the last two fiscal years by each of these categories is as follows revenues during the months ended average of total product a product b repairs the customer has indicated that it has successfully developed  tested  and released its version of product a and is currently shipping such product to new accounts 
the customer has also indicated that it intends to continue to purchase from pro dex sufficient levels of product a to support replacement units for its existing customers in the us and europe through at least the end of calendar year and will also use the pro dex product a for all requirements in the south american market through approximately the end of fiscal year regarding product b  a more complex device  the customer has indicated that the development and testing of that product has been less successful and that the company can expect continued orders from the customer for product b through the end of calendar year lastly  the customer has indicated that it intends to continue to use pro dex s repair services for all pro dex products for an undetermined period  except in south america  where it will purchase components from pro dex to do its own repairs locally 
as a result of the foregoing  we expect that approximately one third of the revenue attributable to this customer during calendar year could move toward them 
however  the customer is not obligated to abide by the timetables it has currently expressed to us or to update us as to the status of its product development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to know or predict the status of the customer s initiative on an ongoing basis 
the customer could accelerate  delay or terminate its transition to its own products at any time and without notice to us  which could have a further material impact on our revenues 
the identity of the customer is protected by a confidentiality agreement 
the company intends to find additional business and reduce its operating costs as necessary to minimize the impact of a potential revenue reduction 
in the event that the customer s future purchases are reduced beyond the additional business won and the cost savings realized  the company is likely to experience a material and adverse impact on its business 
issues related to credit facilities we have a credit facility with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo and a mortgage with union bank of california  n 
a union bank 
wells fargo credit facility as of june   the wells fargo credit facility had two components a revolving credit line note line of credit of up to  in borrowing availability  and a five year term note the ti loan with an initial balance of  of which  was outstanding as of june  if borrowings under the line of credit exceed  the maximum amount of borrowing is limited to the lesser of  or of the eligible accounts receivable plus of the eligible inventory 
its terms require monthly interest payments at either i the prime rate of interest at june  plus  or ii three month libor at june  plus  at our discretion  based on outstanding borrowings 
the line of credit expires on november  we are charged an unused credit line fee of per annum payable quarterly on the average balance of the line of credit that is not used 
there was no outstanding balance under the credit line as of june  the total eligible additional borrowing capacity under the line of credit as of june  was the ti loan had an initial balance of  the borrowings from this term commitment were used for construction of tenant improvements for our irvine  california facility 
its terms require monthly principal and interest payments over the month life of the loan  based on outstanding borrowings 
the interest rate is fixed at over the life of the loan 
there was a  outstanding balance under the ti loan as of june  all assets of the company except our carson city land and building secure the outstanding borrowings under the wells fargo credit facility 
union bank mortgage in march  we entered into a ten year mortgage with union bank for  the principal balance of the mortgage bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
payments on the mortgage are  per month based on a year amortization  with the balance of  in principal due on april  the mortgage is secured by our carson city land and building 
there was  in principal outstanding under the mortgage as of june  on september   we paid the remaining  balance due on the mortgage  fully retiring such indebtedness 
there are certain financial and non financial covenants that the company must meet to be in compliance with the terms of the wells fargo credit facility and mortgage with union bank 
as of the year ended june   we were in violation of the wells fargo annual net income  the quarterly earnings before tax and fixed charge coverage covenants 
wells fargo waived these violations by a letter agreement on september  we were in compliance with the union bank financial covenant  however the wells violation triggered a cross default under the union bank agreement as of june  that was waived on september  at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with cash flows from operations  if any  and amounts available under the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for this and the next year 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase on the open market of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock at a share price no greater than  subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
there is no requirement that we repurchase all or any portion of such shares 
the maximum total value of the repurchase is not to exceed  from the inception of the repurchase authorization through the fiscal year end date of june   we repurchased  shares of common stock for  at an average price of per share 
no additional shares were repurchased in fiscal years through during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for  at an average price of per share 
since the initiation of the buyback program in through june   we have repurchased  shares for  at an average price of per share 
our board suspended the buyback authorization in may and has not set a reinitiation date for the purchase of our shares pursuant to this program 
impact of inflation and changing prices the industries in which we compete are labor intensive  often involving personnel with high level technical or sales skills 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the marketplace occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
to some extent  we have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges  expanding services and implementing cost control measures 
nevertheless  our ability to increase prices is limited by market conditions  including international competition in many of our markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value  asu which provides clarification that in circumstances where a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  a reporting entity must measure fair value of the liability using one of the following techniques the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique  such as a present value technique or the amount that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability that is consistent with the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the company adopted this statement for the quarter ended september  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance intended to improve disclosure about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires entities to disclose significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels and the reasons for the transfers and to present information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
additionally  the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using significant other observable inputs level and significant unobservable inputs level 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  except for the disclosure about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level reconciliation  which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  as this guidance provides only disclosure requirements  the adoption of this standard will not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb has issued accounting standards codification asc and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles codification 
this authoritative guidance established the codification  which officially launched on july   to serve as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the subsequent issuances of new standards will be in the form of accounting standards updates asus that will be included in the codification 
the company adopted the codification for the quarter ended september  the company s adoption of the codification did not have any impact on the company s financial position and operations as this change is disclosure only in nature 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s not applicable
