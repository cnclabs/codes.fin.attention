table of contents overview mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit  debit and related payment programs of approximately  financial institutions and other entities that are our customers 
we develop and market payment solutions  process payment transactions  and provide support services to our customers and  depending upon the service  to merchants and other clients 
we manage a family of well known  widely accepted payment card brands  including mastercard  mastercard electronic  maestro and cirrus  which we license to our customers 
as part of managing these brands  we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network 
we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands 
cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers 
accordingly  we do not issue cards  extend credit to cardholders  determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers  or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 
we recorded net income of billion  or per diluted share  in versus a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of billion  or per diluted share  in as of december   our liquidity and capital positions remained strong  with billion in cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities and billion in equity 
in addition  we generated cash flows from operations of billion in the year ended december  our net revenues increased in  primarily due to increased transactions  pricing changes and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands  partially offset by approximately percentage points relating to the us dollar average exchange rates strengthening versus the euro and brazilian real average exchange rates 
historically  we experienced greater growth in net revenues than the revenue growth in revenue growth in was 
our lower revenue growth rate primarily reflects the impact of the present global economic environment  which is negatively affecting our customers and their cardholders 
our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer  business and government spending 
changes in cardholder spending behavior  influenced in by recessionary environments and rising unemployment  have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our revenues 
our revenues are primarily based on volumes and transactions 
our volumes are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction 
during  our processed transactions increased  however  our volumes only increased on a local currency converted basis and therefore the average amount per transaction declined 
in  volume based revenues domestic assessments and cross border volume fees decreased compared to and transaction based revenues transaction processing fees increased in during  our processed transactions increased and volumes on a local currency basis increased 
during  net pricing actions contributed approximately percentage points to our net revenue growth 
these net pricing actions included price increases in april and october partially offset by an increase in cross border rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the european commission 
overall  revenue growth was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity and an increase to cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers 
rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
our operating expenses decreased in  compared to  primarily due to lower litigation settlements 
excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in operating expenses  operating expenses declined in compared to in  we realigned our resources and implemented contingency plans in response to the current global economic and business 
table of contents environment 
general and administrative expenses decreased in due to lower expenses for professional fees and travel  partially offset by increased personnel expenses as a result of severance costs incurred related to the realignment of our resources 
advertising and marketing expenses declined in due to reduced spending on sponsorship and promotional activities reflecting cost management initiatives and market realities 
our ratios of operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues  or operating margins  were in versus in and in excluding the impact of special items  our operating margins were in  versus in and in other income expense varies depending on activities not core to our operations 
in  we did not have significant activity comparable to gains realized in and we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment  such as cash and checks  toward electronic forms of payment  such as payment card transactions  creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term 
see business environment for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our long term strategic objectives 
business environment we process transactions from more than countries and territories and in more than currencies 
revenue generated in the united states was approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period  but differences in market maturity  economic health  price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time 
while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries  the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
unprecedented events which began during continued to impact the financial markets around the world  including continued distress in the credit environment  continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention 
in particular  the economies of the united states and the united kingdom have continued to be significantly impacted by this economic turmoil  and it is also impacting other economies around the world 
some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments 
many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence  including potential changes in laws and regulations 
many of our financial institution customers  merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 
mastercard s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis 
the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present 
as a result  our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted  or the company may be impacted  in several ways  including but not limited to the following declining economies  foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors  for example  a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross border travel patterns  which may continue to change 
constriction of consumer and business confidence such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing rising unemployment may continue to cause decreased spending by cardholders 

table of contents our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults 
uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers businesses may make estimates of our revenues  rebates  incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable 
our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability 
our customers may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services 
government intervention and or investments in our customers may have potential negative effects on our business with those banking institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products 
tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility 
our customers may default on their settlement obligations 
see note settlement and travelers cheque risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item for further discussion of our settlement exposure 
our business and prospects  as well as our revenue and profitability  could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers 
see consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers  which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability in part i  item a 
in addition  our business is subject to regulation in many countries 
regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry 
for example  see note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  for a discussion of global interchange proceedings 
our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry such as premium affluent  quick service low value  commercial small business  debit  prepaid and issuer and acquirer processor services  pursuing domestic processing opportunities throughout the world  enhancing our merchant relationships  expanding points of acceptance for our brands  seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands

revenue was not impacted by these changes 

table of contents impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real 
the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro  and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real 
accordingly  the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the us dollar 
for as compared to  the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and brazilian real  which resulted in lower revenues and expenses 
for as compared to  the us dollar weakened against the euro and brazilian real  which increased revenues and expenses 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume gev  which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives 
in most non european regions  gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period 
in europe  gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period 
as a result  our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most non european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies

revenues revenue descriptions mastercard s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders  merchants  issuers the cardholders banks and acquirers the merchants banks 
our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands  the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar  euro and brazilian real 
we process transactions denominated in more than currencies through our global system  providing cardholders with the ability to utilize  and merchants to accept  mastercard cards across multiple country borders 
we process most of the cross border transactions using mastercard  maestro and cirrus branded cards and process the majority of mastercard branded domestic transactions in the united states  united kingdom  canada  brazil and australia 
our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes  types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers 
a combination of the following factors determines the pricing domestic or cross border signature based credit and offline debit or pin based on line debit  including automated teller machine atm cash withdrawals and retail purchases tiered pricing  with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume transaction hurdles geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal 
table of contents cross border transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees 
we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future 
in addition  standard pricing varies among our regional businesses  and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 
the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories domestic assessments domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on mastercard and maestro branded cards where the merchant country and the cardholder country are the same 
a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
in addition  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments  which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes  such as acceptance development or market development programs 
acceptance development fees are charged primarily to us issuers based on components of volume  and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale 
cross border volume fees cross border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on mastercard and maestro branded cards where the merchant country and the cardholder country are different 
cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases and cash disbursements from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
cross border volume fees also include fees  charged to issuers  for performing currency conversion services 
transaction processing fees transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions 
these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service 
transaction processing fees include charges for the following transaction switching authorization  clearing and settlement 
a 
authorization refers to a process in which a transaction is approved by the issuer or  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted  by mastercard or other on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer s instructions or applicable rules 
mastercard s rules  which vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 
fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers 
b 
clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed 
fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers 
c 
settlement refers to facilitating the exchange of funds between parties 
fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers 
connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company s network 

table of contents other revenues other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors  such as contractual agreements 
examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions 
this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants 
cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard branded cards  such as insurance  telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines 
consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors  the company s professional advisory services group

the company also charges for a variety of other payment related services  including compliance and penalty fees  account and transaction enhancement services  holograms and publications 
rebates and incentives contra revenue rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that performance occurs 
performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive  including commitments to the agreement term  hurdles for volumes  transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance  the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements

there is a capital lease for the kansas city  missouri co processing data center 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements 
amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the mastercard brand 
the amounts included are fixed and non cancelable

seasonality the changes in the global economic environment during and impacted our historical trends experienced during the fourth quarter each year  which have included increased revenues and expenses related to end of the year activities 
our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer  business and government spending 
our lower revenue growth rates began in the fourth quarter and continued during and are primarily due to lower growth rates in purchase volumes and transactions than in the past 
in addition  mastercard implemented resource realignment and cost savings initiatives  with particular focus on personnel  travel expenditures and advertising  during and as our business and the economic environment continue to evolve  we expect new trends to emerge 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 
financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition our domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly gdv or gev to realize quarterly domestic assessments each quarter 
our domestic assessments included an estimate representing of total domestic assessments in each of  and and  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
our revenue recognition policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
our customers gdv and gev is estimated by using historical performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated against the gdv or gev reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 
historically  our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than of the estimates on a quarterly basis 
rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customer s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include gdv or gev  transactions  issuance of new cards  launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
in addition  certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives 
amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements 
our estimates of each customer s performance are based on historical customer performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions legal and regulatory matters we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters 
except as described in note obligations under litigation settlements and note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report  mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects 
we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we have various tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions  establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ by a material amount 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings  respectively  in the period 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained  this would decrease or increase earnings in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations 
we considered business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions asset impairment analyses prepaid customer and merchant incentives we prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives 
in the event of customer or merchant business failure  these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business 
impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customer s future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement 
our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance  discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future 
if events or changes in circumstances occur that we are not aware of  additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred 
the carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was million at december  goodwill and intangible assets excluding capitalized software we perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
our goodwill policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we utilized a weighted income and market approach for determining the fair values of our reporting units 
our significant valuation judgments included forecasting cash flows  selection of discount rates and selection of comparable companies 
we used both internal and external data to make these judgments 
if market conditions or business conditions change in the future  we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets 
the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  excluding capitalized software  was million  including million of unamortizable customer relationships  as of december  we determined that the majority of our customer relationships  which are intangible assets  have indefinite lives 
in addition to the impairment testing noted above  we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually 
we used internal data regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value 
if a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate  it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a decline of future net income 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements transfers of financial assets in june  the accounting standard for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was amended 
the change eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept  establishes a new unit of account definition that must be met for the transfer of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting  clarifies and changes the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  changes the amount of gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor  and requires additional new disclosures 
the company will adopt the new standard upon its effective date of january  and does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
variable interest entities in june  there was a revision to the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the revision eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities  requires a new qualitative approach for determining whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity  and changes the requirement of when to reassess whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity 
during february  the scope of the revised standard was modified to indefinitely exclude certain entities from the requirement to be assessed for consolidation 
the standard is effective beginning on january  and the company does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended 
current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable  even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors 
the new accounting standard eliminates i the residual method of revenue allocation and ii the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
the company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective january  via prospective adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of the standard to determine the impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
improving fair value disclosures in january  fair value disclosure requirements were amended and will require incremental disclosures about instruments within the valuation categories used in the fair value measurements 
the company will adopt the guidance during and  as required  and the adoption will have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk 
we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity price risk 
management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies  which have been approved by the board of directors  governing our funding  investments and use of derivative financial instruments 
we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 
there were no material changes in our market risk exposures at december  as compared to december  foreign exchange risk we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies 
we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the objective of this activity is 
table of contents to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies  principally the us dollar and euro 
the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than months 
us dollar functional currency in millions december  december  notional estimated fair value notional estimated fair value commitments to purchase foreign currency commitments to sell foreign currency euro functional currency in millions december  december  notional estimated fair value notional estimated fair value commitments to purchase foreign currency commitments to sell foreign currency our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of other transaction currencies 
the remaining transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate risk our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments  which we hold as available for sale investments 
with respect to fixed maturities  our general policy is to invest in high quality securities  while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure 
the fair value and maturity distribution of the company s available for sale investments as of december was as follows maturity in millions financial instrument summary terms fair market value at december  no contractual maturity and thereafter municipal bonds fixed interest short term bond funds fixed variable interest auction rate securities variable interest total
