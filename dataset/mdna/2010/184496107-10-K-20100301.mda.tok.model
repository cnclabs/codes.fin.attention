we expect the acquisition to extend our capabilities in both the environmental and industrial services marketplace  providing cross selling opportunities for the combined organization and significantly broadening our presence throughout canada 

table of contents the purchase price of the acquisition totaled million and included the issuance of million shares of our common stock  assumption of million of eveready debt  and a cash payment of million to the former eveready shareholders

we used most of the net proceeds of the offering to repay and terminate substantially all of the then outstanding eveready debt other than certain capital leases assumed in connection with the acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities
