in addition  the company owns a interest in ponderay newsprint company ponderay  a general partnership  which owns and operates a newsprint mill in the state of washington 
the company is required to purchase up to  metric tons of newsprint annually from ponderay on a take if tendered basis at prevailing market prices  until ponderay s debt is repaid 
the company and affiliates of cox enterprises  inc and media general inc each owned a interest in sp newsprint co 
sp  a newsprint manufacturing company in north america that was sold in see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation below for an expanded discussion of this transaction 
the company has an annual purchase commitment for up to  metric tons of newsprint from sp 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for a majority of its investments in unconsolidated companies 
raw materials during fiscal  the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint compared to  metric tons in fiscal for its continuing operations 
the decrease in tons consumed was primarily due to lower advertising sales and circulation volumes  and to conversion to lighter weight newsprint and reduction of web widths at certain newspapers 
the company currently obtains a majority of its supply of newsprint from ponderay and sp  as well as a number of other suppliers  and primarily under long term contracts 
the company s earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
newsprint expense accounted for of total operating expenses in fiscal and in fiscal excluding masthead impairment from total expenses in 
however  because the company has an ownership interest in ponderay  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting the company s operating expenses  would increase the earnings from its share of this investment partially offsetting the increase in the company s newsprint expense 
a decline in newsprint prices would have the opposite effect 
ponderay is also impacted by fluctuations in the cost of energy and fiber used in the papermaking process 
the company estimates that it will use approximately  metric tons of newsprint in fiscal  depending on the level of print advertising  circulation volumes and other business considerations 
the company purchased  metric tons of newsprint from ponderay and sp in see the discussion above  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and the financial statements and accompanying notes for further discussion of the impact of these investments on the company s business

table of contents competition the company s newspapers  direct marketing programs and internet sites compete for advertising revenues and readers time with television  radio  other internet sites  direct mail companies  free shoppers  suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications  and billboard companies  among others 
in some of its markets  the company s newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns 
competition for advertising is generally based upon circulation levels  readership demographics  price  internet usage and advertiser results  while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content  journalistic quality  service and the price of the newspaper 
the company s major daily newspapers are the primary general circulation newspaper in each of their respective markets and lead their local newspaper competitors in both advertising linage and general circulation and readership 
its newspaper internet sites are generally the leading local sites in each of the company s major daily newspaper markets  based upon research conducted by the company and various independent sources 
nonetheless  the company has noted changes in readership trends  including a shift of readers to the internet and mobile devices  and has experienced greater shift of advertising in the classified categories to online advertising 
the company faces greater competition  particularly in the areas of employment  automotive and real estate advertising  by online competitors 
to address the structural shift to digital media  the company s newspapers provide editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats from its daily newspaper to leading local websites  on social network sites such as facebook and twitter  on smart phones and on ereaders  on blogs and in niche publications and websites  in e mail newsletters and rss feeds 
in addition its websites offer leading digital classified products such as careerbuilder  cars 
com and apartments 
com and the company continues to expand it partnerships with technology companies such as its affiliation with yahoo on retail efforts 
employees labor as of december   the company had approximately  full and part time employees equating to approximately  full time equivalent employees  of whom approximately were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements expiring in various years through twenty of the company s daily papers have no unions 
while the company s newspapers have not had a strike for decades and do not currently anticipate a strike occurring  the company cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of its newspapers when future negotiations occur 
the company believes that  in the event of a newspaper strike  it would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers  a capability which is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and circulation  although there can be no assurance of this

for all of those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document  particularly in the section entitled risk factors and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements the duration and depth of the economic recession  mcclatchy might not generate cash from operations  or otherwise  necessary to reduce debt or meet debt covenants as expected  mcclatchy might not consummate contemplated transactions to enable debt reduction on anticipated terms or at all  mcclatchy might not achieve its expense reduction targets or might do harm to its operations in attempting to achieve such targets  mcclatchy s operations have been  and will likely continue to be  adversely affected by competition  including competition from internet publishing and advertising platforms  increases in the cost of newsprint  bankruptcies or financial strain of its major advertising customers  litigation or any potential litigation  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased consolidation among major retailers in our markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  our inability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining agreements with unions  competitive action by other companies  decreased circulation and diminished revenues from retail  classified and national advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the company has significant competition in the market for news and advertising  which may reduce its advertising and circulation revenues in the future 
the company s primary source of revenues is advertising  followed by circulation 
in recent years  the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward internet advertising and away from other traditional media 
in addition  the company s circulation has declined over the last two years  reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including consumer migration toward the internet and other media for news and information 
with the continued development of alternative forms of media technologies  the company faces increasing competition from other online sources for both advertising and circulation revenues 
this competition has intensified as a result of the continued developments of digital media technologies 
distribution of news  entertainment and other information over the internet  as well as through mobile phones and other devices  continues to increase in popularity 
these technological developments are increasing the number of media choices available to advertisers and audiences 
as media audiences fragment  the company expects advertisers to allocate larger portions of their advertising budgets to digital media 
this increased competition has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and operating income 
weak general economic and business conditions subject the company to risks of declines in advertising revenues 
the united states economy is undergoing an extended period of economic uncertainty  which has caused  among other things  a general tightening in the credit markets  limited access to the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  lower consumer and business spending  and lower consumer net worth 
the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer 
table of contents confidence have weakened the economic climate in all of the markets in which the company does business and have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the company s advertising revenues 
classified advertising revenues have continued to decline since late and advertising results declined across the board in and to the extent these economic conditions continue or worsen  the company s business and advertising revenues will be adversely affected  which could negatively impact the company s operations and cash flows and the company s ability to meet the covenants in its senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  seasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenues to fluctuate 
second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues  reflecting the slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season 
if general economic conditions and other factors cause a decline in revenues  particularly during the second or fourth quarters  we may not be able to grow or maintain our revenues for the year which would have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
if management is unable to execute cost control measures successfully  total operating costs may be greater than expected  which may adversely affect the company s profitability 
given general economic and business conditions and the company s recent operating results  the company has taken steps to lower operating costs by reducing workforce and implementing general cost control measures 
if the company does not achieve its expected savings from these initiatives  or if operating costs increase as a result of these initiatives  total operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
although management believes that appropriate steps have been taken and are being taken to implement cost control efforts  such efforts may affect the company s business and its ability to generate future revenue 
significant portions of the company s expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues 
as a result  management is limited in its ability to reduce costs in the short term 
if these cost control efforts do not reduce costs sufficiently  income from continuing operations may continue to decline 
the collectability of accounts receivable under current adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in the company s financial statements 
recessionary conditions in the u 
s have increased the company s exposure to losses resulting from the potential bankruptcy of the company s advertising customers 
the recession could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company even if they do not file for bankruptcy 
as a result  the company s results of operations may continue to be adversely affected 
the company s accounts receivables are stated at net estimated realizable value and the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined based on several factors  including the aging of accounts receivables and evaluation of significant individual credit risk accounts 
if such collectability estimates prove inaccurate  adjustments to future operating results could occur 
the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded stock may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges 
the company recorded masthead impairment charges of million in and billion of goodwill and masthead impairment charges in reflecting the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded common stock 
should general economic  market or business conditions continue to decline  and continue to have a negative impact on the company s stock price  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges 
the company has billion in total consolidated debt  which subjects the company to significant interest rate and credit risk 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total principal indebtedness outstanding 
this level of debt increases the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry 
table of contents conditions 
debt service costs are subject to interest rate changes as well as any changes in the company s leverage ratio ratio of debt to operating cash flow as defined in the company s existing senior secured credit agreement with its banks 
higher leverage ratios could increase the level of debt service costs and also affect the company s future ability to refinance maturing debt  or the ultimate structure of such refinancing 
in addition  the company s credit ratings could affect its ability to refinance its debt 
on february   standard poor s upgraded its corporate credit rating on the company to b from cc  with a stable rating outlook  and the ratings on the company s bonds and senior secured credit facility were upgraded from c to b including the company s senior secured notes due 
on february   moody s upgraded its corporate credit rating on the company to caa from caa  with a stable rating outlook  and the ratings on the company s unsecured bonds were upgraded from caa to caa and moody s issued a b rating on the company s senior secured notes due and senior secured credit facility 
covenants in the indenture governing the company s senior secured notes due the notes and its senior secured credit facility will restrict the company s operations in many ways 
the indenture governing the notes and the senior secured credit facility contain various covenants that limit  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and or our restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur liens or additional debt or provide guarantees  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or repurchase capital stock or repurchase outstanding notes or debentures prior to their stated maturity  make loans  investments or acquisitions  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from its subsidiaries  create or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions or guarantee debt or create liens  sell assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries  enter into certain transactions with its affiliates  and dissolve  liquidate  consolidate or merge with or into  or sell substantially all its assets to another person 
the restrictions contained in the indenture for the notes and the senior secured credit facility could adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations  make needed capital expenditures  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances  withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general  engage in business activities  including future opportunities  that may be in its interest  and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies 
the company s ability to comply with covenants contained in the indenture for the notes and the senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
even if the company is able to comply with all of the applicable covenants  the restrictions on its ability to manage its business could adversely affect its business by  among other things  limiting its ability to take advantage of financings  mergers  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that the company believes would be beneficial to it 

table of contents potential disruptions in the credit markets could adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements  and could adversely affect the company s access to capital or to obtain financing at reasonable rates and its ability to refinance existing debt at reasonable rates or at all 
if internal funds are not available from the company s operations  the company may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet its financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as were experienced during and  could adversely affect the company s ability to access additional funds in the capital markets or draw on its senior secured credit facility 
although the company believes that its operating cash flow and current access to capital and credit markets  including the proceeds from its recent notes offering and funds from its senior secured credit facility  will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair the company s liquidity 
if this should happen  any alternative credit arrangements may not be put in place without a potentially significant increase in the company s cost of borrowing 
as of december   on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the refinancing discussed in item  the company would have had approximately billion in total principal indebtedness  million of which would have consisted of the notes that were issued on february  and million of which would have consisted of borrowings under its senior secured credit facility with the remainder in the form of unsecured publicly traded notes maturing in part in    and while cash flow should permit the company to lower the amount of this debt before it matures  a significant portion of this debt will probably need to be refinanced in the future 
access to the capital markets for longer term financing is currently restricted due to the unprecedented and ongoing turmoil in the capital markets 
the company requires newsprint for operations and  therefore  its operating results may be adversely affected if the price of newsprint increases 
newsprint is the major component of the company s cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses for fiscal accordingly  earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors  including declining newsprint supply from mill closures  reduction in newsprint suppliers because of consolidation in the newsprint industry  paper mills reducing their newsprint supply because of switching their production to other paper grades  and a decline in the financial situation of newsprint suppliers 
the company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  operating results could be adversely affected 
if newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  the company s ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect its operating results 
a portion of the company s employees are members of unions and if the company experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired in some locations 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm the company s operating results 
the company s newspapers have not endured a labor strike for decades 
however  management cannot ensure that a 
table of contents strike will not occur at one or more of the company s newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately of full time and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times through mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if its newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict its ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 
under the pension protection act ppa  the company will be required to make greater cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the next several years than previously required  placing greater liquidity needs upon its operations 
the poor capital markets of that have affected all investments impacted the funds in the company s pension plans which had poor returns in however  strong returns in helped offset a portion of this impact  but  as a result of the plans lower assets  the projected benefit obligations of the company s qualified pension plans exceed plan assets by million as of december  the excess of benefit obligations over pension assets is expected to give rise to an increase in required pension contributions over the next several years 
the ppa funding rules are likely to require the net liability at the end of to be funded with tax deductible contributions between and  with approximately million coming due in contributions in future years  while not yet known  are expected to be substantially higher than the amounts 
while legislation has recently been enacted to give some relief in funding and there may be more related legislation  the contributions will place additional strain on the company s liquidity needs 
the company has invested in certain internet ventures  but such ventures may not be as successful as expected which could adversely affect the results of operations of the company 
the company continues to evaluate its business and make strategic investments in digital ventures  either alone or with partners  to further its growth in its online businesses 
there can be no assurances that these investments or partnerships will result in growth in advertising or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years 
if the company is not successful in growing its digital businesses  its business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
the company s future growth depends to a significant degree upon the development of its digital businesses 
the growth and success of its digital businesses over the long term depends on various factors  including  among other things the ability to continue to increase online audiences  attract advertisers to its web sites  maintain or increase the advertising rates on its web sites  exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish its products and services from those of its competitors and developing new content  products and services  and invest funds and resources in online opportunities 
if the company is not successful in growing its digital businesses  its business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 

table of contents circulation declines could adversely affect the company s circulation and advertising revenues 
advertising and circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels of the company s newspapers 
in recent years  newspapers have experienced difficulty maintaining or increasing print circulation levels because of a number of factors  including increased competition from other publications and other forms of media technologies available in various markets  including the internet and other new media formats that are often free for users  continued fragmentation of media audiences  a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper  increases in subscription and newsstand rates  and declining discretionary spending by consumers affected by negative economic conditions 
these factors could also affect the company s newspapers ability to institute circulation price increases for print products 
a prolonged reduction in circulation would have a material adverse effect on advertising revenues 
to maintain the company s circulation base  it may be required to incur additional costs which it may not be able to recover through circulation and advertising revenues 
adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact the company s business practices and operating results 
from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation and regulatory  environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies 
adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted

the company s primary source of revenue is print and digital advertising  which accounted for of the company s revenue for fiscal print and digital advertising revenues are derived from retail  national and classified advertising 
print and preprinted insert advertising are sold in the daily newspaper  but are also sold in direct marketing and other advertising products 
while percentages vary from year to year and from newspaper to newspaper  classified advertising has steadily decreased as a percentage of total advertising revenues primarily in the employment and real estate categories and to a lesser extent the automotive category 
classified advertising as a percentage of total advertising revenues has declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily as a result of the economic slowdown affecting classified advertising and the secular shift in advertising demand to online products 
while revenues from retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising has decreased year over year  retail advertising has steadily increased as a percentage of total advertising up to in compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this is partially a reflection of retail advertising declining at a slower rate than classified advertising  thus increasing as a percent of total advertising 
national advertising as a percentage of total advertising revenue remained relatively similar year over year and contributed of total advertising revenue in fiscal direct marketing and other advertising made up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues in fiscal while included in the revenues described above  all categories of digital advertising are performing better than print advertising 
in  the company joined a number of other newspaper companies in forming a broad based partnership with yahoo  inc yahoo 
the company s local sales force is able to sell yahoo advertising inventory and share in the revenue from the sales 
in addition  the alliance allows the company to use yahoo s behaviorally targeted ad serving platform apt platform to sell advertising on the company s websites 
while sales of yahoo inventory and behaviorally targeted sales were conducted on a limited test basis in  the company began rolling out the apt platform to its newspaper websites in early in total  revenues from digital advertising increased in fiscal compared to the fiscal while print advertising revenues declined over the same periods 
however  employment advertising revenues  which have been negatively affected by the economic downturn  are down substantially in both print and digital

see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by category for fiscal  and recent events and trends advertising revenues advertising revenues declined across the board in fiscal and fiscal and in nearly every category in fiscal classified advertising revenues have continued to decline since late real estate advertising revenues began to weaken in the fourth fiscal quarter of and have declined substantially since then 
the decline in automotive classified advertising revenues reflected an industry wide decline that began in  while employment advertising revenues have declined in most markets since the third fiscal quarter of national advertising also declined in fiscal years through reflecting a slowdown in a number of segments including telecommunications  national automotive and financial advertising 
in each case  management believes the declines are primarily attributable to the weaknesses in the united states economy  and to a lesser extent  the general shift in advertising to the internet where the company s newspapers face increased competition 
advertising revenues in the fourth quarter of and in january and february have declined at a slower rate than the first nine months of  evidence that the recession may be lessening in impact in the markets in which the company operates

the company s workforce in was reduced by approximately  positions 
the workforce reductions resulted in total severance costs of approximately million which was largely paid in in march  the company announced additional restructuring efforts which included reducing the company s workforce by  or  positions  the freezing of the company s pension plans and a temporary suspension of the company matching contribution to the k plan as of march  the company s restructuring plan also involved wage reductions across the company for additional savings

global demand remains weak resulting in continued low capacity utilization and below average newsprint prices 
newsprint prices peaked in the fourth quarter of and producers dropped prices in fiscal prices began 
table of contents to increase in the second half of but announcement of further price increases have been delayed since late hence  the company does not yet know whether the full amount of announced newsprint price increases will be implemented or the timing of such increases 
significant changes in newsprint prices can increase or decrease the company s operating expenses and therefore  directly affect the company s operating results 
however  because the company has ownership interests in newsprint producer ponderay  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting the company s operating expenses  would increase its share of earnings from this investment 
a decline in newsprint prices would have the opposite effect 
ponderay is also impacted by the higher cost of energy and fiber used in the papermaking process

table of contents critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s accounting for income taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the company becomes aware that the financial condition of a customer has deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
goodwill and intangible impairment the company tests for goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such indicators of impairment may include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate such as an economic downturn  significant operating cash flow declines related to its newspapers or a major change in the assessment of future operations of its newspapers  or a sustained decline in the company s stock price below the per share book value of stockholders equity 
the company conducted its annual impairment testing at the end of its fiscal years in and in  due to the continuing challenging business conditions and the resulting weakness in the company s stock price  the company conducted interim impairment testing as of september  and conducted its normal annual testing at its fiscal year end  december  as a result of its testing  impairment charges related to newspaper mastheads were recorded in fiscal and and related to goodwill in fiscal please see additional information in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
summary of approach and analysis of impairments the required two step approach to test for impairment requires the use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
because accounting standards require that impairment testing be done at a reporting unit level  the company performs this testing on its operating segments which are considered reporting units 
an impairment charge generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
in summary the company conducts its tests and considers the following factors the fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the projected cash flows are based on estimates of revenues  newsprint expenses and other cash costs 
while these estimates are always inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  the ability to project future operations and in particular advertising revenues has become more difficult due to the unprecedented declines in print advertising as discussed below 
the discount rate is determined using the company s weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for risks perceived by investors which are implicit in the company s publicly traded stock price 
the amount of a goodwill impairment charge requires management to allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible 
table of contents assets  using its best judgments and estimates in valuing the reporting unit  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting total fair value of the reporting units is then reconciled to the market capitalization of the company  giving effect to an appropriate control premium 
a goodwill impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the implied goodwill values are below the book value of goodwill for the reporting units 
management believes the lack of visibility in future revenue trends has affected investors view of the company s enterprise value as reflected in its stock price  particularly from the end of through mid continued declines in the company s revenues  which are not offset by the company s cost restructuring efforts  will likely have an impact on the fair value of the company s reporting units as determined by the company s discounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  a sustained decline in the value of the company s stock price likely the result of declining revenues not sufficiently offset with cost savings would be considered an indicator of impairment  as discussed below 
a more comprehensive discussion of the factors that affected the impairment charges in and follows 
factors affecting fair value calculations for goodwill impairment in fair value is determined using an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value 
the estimated future cash flows projected can vary within a range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and estimates used 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are assumptions related to revenue  and in particular  potential changes in future advertising including the impact of economic trends and the speed of conversion of advertising and readership to online products from traditional print products  trends in newsprint prices  and other operating expense items 
the following were trends considered by the company in developing assumptions and estimates for its discounted cash flow analysis in beginning in mid  advertising declined as the real estate boom began to unwind and newspapers in the states that experienced the largest run up in real estate values experienced advertising revenue declines 
the real estate led downturn subsequently spread to other sectors in the economy and across the nation 
as a result  advertising declined in the newspaper industry in and the decline worsened through the company s advertising revenues in were up but declined in both years pro forma for the acquisition of knight ridder and continued to decline in the early months of advertising has been moving to the internet  particularly in the employment category 
this shift in advertiser preferences accelerated as the economy slowed 
while much of this advertising was captured by newspapers websites  low barriers to entry and the searchable format of the internet gave rise to many more competitors online than in print  particularly in the classified advertising categories 
newsprint expense is the largest raw material input in the production of newspapers and has ranged from in to in of cash operating expenses for the company 
newsprint producers consolidated and reduced capacity in and foreign demand of newsprint rose during that period  causing prices to begin to rise in late and however  newsprint usage is at historical lows due to declines in circulation and advertising  and to a lesser extent  to the migration of some readers and advertisers to the internet 
through  the company had been in a process of downsizing its business as it became a hybrid print and online news and information company  ultimately a smaller company than when it was primarily focused on print alone 
compensation expenses are the largest component of the company s expenses and management has reduced its workforce and restructured operations over time by using 
table of contents attrition  outsourcing and consolidating functions 
other expenses were also targeted for reductions in the restructuring 
as revenue declines accelerated  the pace of restructuring also accelerated in leading to restructuring initiatives announced by the company on june  and september  that included workforce reductions 
the company was in the process of developing these restructuring plans in and took them into consideration in considering the fair value of its reporting units in  to the extent known at the time 
while the impact of these trends and anticipation of restructuring efforts were taken into account in the company s discounted cash flow models  assumptions about their impact on future operations are subject to variability and the ultimate outcome and specific advertising growth rates are highly subjective for individual newspapers 
factors affecting fair value calculations for goodwill impairment in and while advertising continued to decline during and into the first half of at an accelerating pace  the company implemented restructuring plans which mitigated the impact of the decline in advertising revenues on its cash flows and helped stabilize its operations 
these restructuring plans  which are discussed in greater detail in the section  recent events and trends  restructuring plans and other expense activity above  were key in offsetting the impact of declining revenues on the company s operations 
the company also implemented circulation price increases at most newspapers in which resulted in growth in circulation revenues 
in addition  beginning in the second half of  and particularly in the fourth quarter of  the rate of decline in advertising revenues began to slow and the company began to increase its operating income 
as a result of the adjustment to record goodwill at fair value in and the considerations above  no impairment charges to adjust the value of goodwill were necessary in fiscal or fiscal fair value calculations by their nature require management to make assumptions about future operating results which can be difficult to predict with certainty 
they are influenced by management s views of future advertising trends in the industry  and in the markets in which it operates newspapers 
as discussed above  the variability in these trends and the difficulty in projecting advertising growth  in particular  in each newspaper market are impacted by the unprecedented declines in advertising 
however  based on management s analysis  the fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than as of december  discount rate considerations in developing an appropriate discount rate to apply in its discounted cash flow models the company develops an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital 
management also reviews the status of interest rates in the capital markets and considers in its estimates the level of interest rates and perceived market risk associated with media companies at large and the company s value specifically 
the ultimate discount rate selected is influenced by the current market capitalization 
the company also reviews the value of each newspaper as calculated in the discounted cash flow model at various discount rates in comparison to public and private market trading multiples for newspaper assets as a reasonableness check 
enterprise value and reconciliation to market capitalization the trends discussed above  along with general economic conditions  affect the market s perception of mcclatchy s enterprise value 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units is compared to the company s current market capitalization based upon the recent stock market prices plus an estimated control premium  to determine the reasonableness of the fair values 
the estimated control premium is based in part upon multiples achieved in sales transactions of media companies with similar dual class stock structures as the company 
though there is a level of subjectivity and variability related to the assumptions in projecting future operating results  this process provides observable market input into and therefore influences the range of values ascribed to the reporting units 

table of contents masthead considerations newspaper mastheads newspaper titles and website domain names are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount 
the company uses a relief from royalty approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
management s judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the reporting unit fair values are consistently applied to each newspaper in determining the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
the company performed its annual impairment tests on newspaper mastheads as of december  and december  as discussed above  due to challenging business conditions  the company conducted interim impairment testing as of september  and conducted its normal annual testing at its fiscal year end  december  as a result of its testing  impairment charges related to newspaper mastheads were recorded in fiscal and however  the improvement in operations in also discussed above resulted in no impairment charges to the value of mastheads in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges taken in and other intangible assets considerations intangible assets subject to amortization primarily advertiser and subscriber lists are tested for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group 
no impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization 
pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
current standards of accounting for defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefit plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and the funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december   net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of plan assets for the company s qualified plan netted to a million liability at december  at december   net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of qualified plan assets netted to a million liability at december  on february   the company announced a decision to freeze its defined benefit pension plans as of march  the company used discount rates of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in the expenses were also impacted by freezing the plan in march see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 

table of contents for fiscal a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on the company s net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have decreased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 
income taxes the company s current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to periodic audits by federal and state taxing authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
these audits may challenge certain aspects of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future periods 
insurance the company is insured for workers compensation using both self insurance and large deductible programs 
the company relies on claims experience in determining an adequate provision for insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
a increase in claims would have increased the total workers compensation reserves by approximately million
