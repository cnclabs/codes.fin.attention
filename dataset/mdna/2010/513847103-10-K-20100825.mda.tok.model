the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
executive summary business overview lancaster colony corporation is a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products focusing primarily on specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets 
although not material to our consolidated operations  we are also engaged in the distribution of various products  including glassware and candles  to commercial markets 
our operations are organized in two reportable segments specialty foods and glassware and candles 
over of the sales of each segment are made to customers in the united states 
in recent years  our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our specialty foods segment 
fiscal years prior to were significant years in implementing this strategy as we divested nonfood operations and focused our capital investment in the specialty foods segment 
in  we sold substantially all of the assets of our remaining automotive operations as well as most of our consumer and floral glass operating assets 
these transactions  combined with other previous strategic dispositions and investments  have resulted in transforming our company into a predominately food focused business 
see further discussion of these divestitures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income were derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
below is a list of the material transactions and other events in that contributed toward our transition to a food focused business june sale of the remaining automotive operations  ending the previously reported automotive segment  november sale of substantially all of the operating assets of our consumer and floral glass operations  and september substantial completion and operational start up of new frozen yeast roll facility in horse cave  kentucky 
we intend to continue periodically reassessing the strategic fit and contribution of our remaining nonfood operations in light of market conditions  capital needs and other factors 
our current strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to our nonfood operations 
without distraction from significant issues 
table of contents previously posed by our divested automotive and glassware businesses  we believe we are now better positioned to maximize the future potential of our specialty foods segment 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  demonstrated experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 
our goal is to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business over time by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  growing our foodservice sales through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 
within retail markets  our specialty foods segment utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 
our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
over the long term  we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our future growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
as has occasionally been required to support future growth opportunities  we have historically made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations  including in the above mentioned facility to manufacture frozen yeast rolls that began operations in at an adjoining location  we began production activities at a newly constructed dressing facility in both projects helped accommodate potential future sales growth and also provided greater manufacturing efficiencies 
based on our current plans and expectations  including expectations of a plant expansion at our kentucky frozen roll facility  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately to million 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated operating results for the year ended june  results for reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations in or consolidated net sales reached approximately  million during  increasing by less than as compared to prior year net sales of  million  driven by growth coming from our glassware and candles segment as partially offset by a decline in specialty foods segment sales 
the increase in net sales of the glassware and candles segment reflected higher unit volume on improved consumer demand for high quality  value priced candles and the introduction and success of various new products 
the decline in sales of the specialty foods segment reflected moderately lower foodservice sales  as partially offset by higher retail sales 

table of contents gross margin increased to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
lower raw material costs  a more favorable sales mix in the specialty foods segment and the benefits of higher candle sales contributed to the higher gross margins 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under the cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this md a 
net income totaled approximately million in  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share  and was inclusive of an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the loss on the sale of discontinued operations was approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
looking forward we currently anticipate further growth in consolidated sales during factors that we believe should contribute to our growth include the introduction of several new retail food products as well as the expansion of existing product lines with current customers or into new markets 
we will also continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy  represent good value or otherwise provide significant strategic benefits 
however  unsettled economic conditions affecting consumer and retailer buying patterns are among the many influences that may impact sales improvement and our ability to sustain or improve operating margins 
within our specialty foods segment  we anticipate that modest increases in marketing and promotional costs will occur in to support the consumer awareness and competiveness of our branded retail products 
all else equal  a continuation of greater consumer spending on food consumed at home  as opposed to away from home  would be helpful to operating margins as our retail products typically possess higher contribution margins than foodservice products 
with respect to material input costs  on balance  we enter experiencing an elevation of such costs over levels 
it is also possible that a recovery in general economic conditions and other changes in the economy and regulatory environment could cause a more pronounced increase in the costs of food commodities and other raw materials 
to help offset or stabilize the impact of these rising costs  we have pursued other operational strategies that we believe will aid our future results 
for instance  as part of our cost reduction efforts  we consolidated our wilson  new york and atlanta  georgia production operations into our other existing facilities in the second quarter of and early  respectively 
we are continuing to limit some of our exposure to volatile swings in food commodity costs through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 
with respect to our glassware and candles segment  operating results in benefited from higher sales and production levels as well as lower material costs  especially for paraffin wax 
however  we expect paraffin wax cost comparisons to turn unfavorable in we are currently attempting to implement mitigating increases in our prices to customers  although the ultimate outcome and extent of relief from these actions is indeterminable at present 
we currently expect this segment s operating income to be challenged to reach the level of for a more detailed discussion of the effect of commodity costs  see the impact of inflation section of this md a below 
in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders  whether through share repurchases or cash dividends  including special dividends  if appropriate 

table of contents review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased by less than to approximately  million from the prior year total of approximately  million 
in  increased sales within the glassware and candles segment were partially offset by lower sales within the specialty foods segment 
the specialty foods segment s sales decline reflected moderately lower foodservice sales  as partially offset by higher retail sales 
the increase in net sales of the glassware and candles segment reflected higher unit volume on improved consumer demand for high quality  value priced candles and the introduction and success of various new products 
consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased over the total of approximately million 
this sales growth was driven by increased sales in the specialty foods segment as partially offset by a decline in sales of the glassware and candles segment 
the specialty foods segment s growth benefited from pricing actions  as well as higher volumes in both the retail and foodservice markets 
all such growth was internally generated 
the decrease in net sales of the glassware and candles segment is primarily attributable to the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations and the prior year disposition of inventory related to closing our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations totaled approximately million in our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in in the specialty foods segment  gross margin percentages improved in as a result of lower commodity costs  a stronger retail mix and operating efficiency improvements 
we estimate the favorable year over year impact of commodity costs for the year ended june  approximated of the segment s net sales 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment improved from the prior year due to lower material costs  especially for paraffin wax  and higher sales and production levels 
in the specialty foods segment  gross margin percentages improved in  benefiting from both pricing actions and higher sales volumes  which offset the adverse impact of higher ingredient costs incurred during the first half of the fiscal year 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment declined from due to higher wax costs  declines in candle sales and lower capacity utilization within candle manufacturing operations 
also affecting results were a charge of approximately million recorded in cost of sales for the loss on the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  a pension settlement charge of approximately million recorded in corporate expenses and income of approximately million to reflect a favorable adjustment of prior year self insured deductibles under our general liability insurance 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense as a percentage of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled approximately million and increased as compared with the total of million  while the total had increased from the total of million 
in  increased costs in consumer directed marketing initiatives to support retail sales and increased professional fees within the specialty foods segment contributed to the overall increase 
included in expenses were recoveries of bad debt associated with the bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation totaling approximately million 
we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in relative to  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was influenced by the extent to which the higher sales leveraged our existing selling and organizational infrastructure 
restructuring and impairment charges specialty foods segment fiscal in the first quarter of  we committed to a plan to close our dressings and sauces manufacturing operation located in wilson  new york 
this decision was intended to provide greater efficiency in our specialty foods segment by consolidating most of this facility s operations into other existing plants  outsourcing certain requirements and exiting less profitable dressing lines 
production at this facility was phased out in the second quarter of  and while timing of the disposal of the associated real estate is difficult to predict  this closure was essentially complete at december  the operations of this location have not been reclassified to discontinued operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million million after taxes  including approximately million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories 
the remaining charges consisted of one time termination benefits  a pension curtailment charge and other various closing costs 
cash expenditures for were approximately million and related to the one time termination benefits and other closing costs 
an analysis of the restructuring activity for recorded within the specialty foods segment follows accrual at accrual at june  cash june  dollars in thousands charges outlays restructuring charges employee separation costs other costs subtotal pension curtailment charges inventory write down total restructuring charges we do not expect any other restructuring costs or cash expenditures related to this closure 
the total costs associated with this closure were ultimately less than originally estimated due to the actual timing of the closure and its impact on the one time termination benefits and also due to lower than expected other closing costs 

table of contents specialty foods segment fiscal in the first quarter of  we began consolidating our atlanta  georgia dressing operation into our other existing food facilities as part of our cost reduction efforts within the specialty foods segment 
during  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million million after taxes 
this closure was essentially complete at september   and the disposition of the associated real estate occurred in december we do not expect any other costs or cash expenditures related to this closure 
other in  we closed our industrial glass operation that was located in lancaster  ohio 
the majority of the total million restructuring and impairment charge related to this closure was recorded in  but we did incur approximately million million after taxes and million million after taxes during the years ended june  and  respectively 
the and charges were included within our glassware and candles segment because that is where the operation was classified 
after the closure was essentially completed in  the related activities were recorded in corporate expenses 
we do not currently expect other significant restructuring costs related to this closure 
held for sale as a result of the current year closing discussed above  as well as various prior year restructuring and divestiture activities  we have certain held for sale properties with a total net book value of approximately million that have been reclassified to current assets and are included in deferred income taxes and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with gaap for property  plant and equipment  we are no longer depreciating these held for sale assets and they are being actively marketed for sale

operating income loss specialty foods glassware and candles corporate expenses total operating income loss as a percentage of sales specialty foods glassware and candles consolidated due to the factors discussed above  consolidated operating income for totaled approximately million  a increase from operating income of million 
the total had increased from operating income totaling approximately million 
see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income below 
interest expense we incurred no interest expense in as there were no borrowings outstanding during the year 
lower interest rates on our debt as well as an overall decrease in average borrowing levels resulted in interest expense of approximately million in related to long term borrowings as compared to million in we had no outstanding borrowings at june  or other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act the cdsoa provides for the distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers 
our reported cdsoa receipts totaled approximately million  
table of contents million and million in  and  respectively 
these remittances related to certain candles being imported from the people s republic of china 
legislation was enacted in february to repeal the applicability of the cdsoa to duties collected on products imported after september accordingly  we may receive some level of annual distributions for an undetermined period of years in the future as the monies collected that relate to entries filed prior to october are administratively finalized by us customs 
without further legislative action  we expect these distributions will eventually cease 
in addition to this legislative development  cases have been brought in us courts challenging the cdsoa 
in two separate cases  the cit ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed both cit decisions 
we are unable to determine  at this time  what the ultimate outcome of litigation regarding the cdsoa will be  and it is possible that further legal action  potential additional changes in the law and other factors could affect the amount of funds available for distribution  including funds relating to entries prior to october accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of future distributions  and it is possible that we may not receive any further distributions under the cdsoa 
any reduction in cdsoa distributions could reduce our earnings and cash flow 
interest income and other net interest income and other was income of less than million  expense of approximately million and income of approximately million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to reflects a lower level of interest income due to lower interest rates 
income from continuing operations before income taxes as affected by the factors discussed above  our income from continuing operations before income taxes for of approximately million increased from the total of million 
the total income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately million 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was  and in  and  respectively 
the lower rate in reflected  in part  a favorable resolution of certain previously reserved state and local tax matters in  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
relative to  the rate was influenced by a higher federal deduction related to domestic production activities and an overall lower state tax rate 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations totaled approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  as influenced by the factors noted above 
income from continuing operations per share totaled approximately per basic share and per diluted share in  as compared to per basic and diluted share in and per basic and diluted share in income per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  discontinued operations there were no discontinued operations in or in  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  including an after tax loss on sale of approximately million 
loss from discontinued operations per share totaled approximately 
per basic and diluted share in see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements

segment review specialty foods during  net sales of the specialty foods segment declined approximately from the record level achieved in  and operating income of approximately million increased from the level 
table of contents of million 
lower raw material costs and a more favorable sales mix contributed to the higher level of operating income 
net sales during totaled approximately million  a decrease from the prior year total of million 
sales for increased over the total of approximately million 
the percentage of retail customer sales within the segment was approximately during  as compared to in and the decline in net sales of the specialty foods segment in reflected generally flat volumes and lower pricing to customers in foodservice channels 
higher sales to retail channel customers were more than offset by lower foodservice sales 
foodservice sales declined by approximately for the year ended june   with contributing factors including weaker chain restaurant demand and downward pricing adjustments in certain of our customer supply arrangements that occurred as a result of lower key ingredient costs 
net sales to retail channel customers increased in on volume growth from several product lines  as partially offset by the exiting of less profitable dressing lines with the closing of our wilson  new york operation 
in  we estimate that more than half of the specialty foods segment s sales growth was derived from pricing actions  although we also attained higher volumes in both the retail and foodservice markets 
in foodservice markets  our sales increase over was broad based with growth among various customers and product lines  including dressings and sauces  frozen rolls and frozen pasta 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  a increase from the total of million 
the level was higher than the level of million 
the increase reflects lower commodity costs  a stronger retail sales mix and operating efficiency improvements 
we estimate that the favorable year over year impact of commodity costs approximated of net sales 
in march  we announced a recall of a limited number of veggie and chip dip food products after being notified by one of our suppliers  basic food flavors  inc  of a recall of an ingredient used in our products due to potential salmonella contamination 
we recorded costs of approximately million related to this recall in we estimate the total costs of the recall will be approximately million 
we expect reimbursement of certain costs incurred over our deductible from our insurance carrier and thus have recorded a receivable of approximately million at june  the increase in operating income over primarily reflects higher pricing and greater sales volumes 
these improvements offset the adverse impact of higher ingredient costs incurred during the first half of the fiscal year 
we estimate the unfavorable year over year impact of commodity costs at approximately million in segment review glassware and candles glassware and candles segment sales totaled approximately million during  as compared to million in and million in the increase in net sales of the glassware and candles segment for reflected higher unit volume on improved consumer demand for high quality  value priced candles and the introduction  expanded product placement and the success of various new products 
the decline in net sales of the glassware and candles segment for was influenced by the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations in november  as well as the earlier closure of our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations totaled approximately million in the decline was also affected by lower candle sales 
unsettled economic and competitive retail market conditions contributed to this decline 
the segment recorded operating income of approximately million in compared to operating losses of million during and million during operating results of the glassware and candles segment improved in due to lower material costs  especially for paraffin wax  and higher sales and production levels 
the decline reflects a decrease in candle sales  higher wax costs and lower capacity utilization  as partially offset by higher pricing implemented on various candle products 
comparisons to were also affected by the approximately million loss recorded in cost of sales from the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  as well as the loss of subsequent contribution from these operations over the balance of future results may also remain sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the relatively high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exists in this segment 

table of contents corporate expenses the corporate expenses totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the increase in corporate expenses includes approximately million of charges for the write down of fixed assets and other costs related to demolition activity at certain of our held for sale properties 
the decrease in the expenses of approximately million from relates to encompassing a pension settlement charge of approximately million associated with one of our divested automotive operations 
on a comparative basis  this decrease was somewhat offset by expenses including restructuring and other costs related to divested and closed operations 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with approximately million in cash and equivalents at june   along with shareholders equity of nearly million and no debt 
in october  we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility  which replaced the previously existing credit facility 
under the new facility  we may borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time 
loans may be used for general corporate purposes 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at june  the facility expires in october  and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  asset sales and acquisitions  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
at june   we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of the facility  and we met the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins 
we currently expect to remain in compliance with the facility s covenants for the foreseeable future 
a default under the facility could accelerate the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to additional credit available under the facility 
such an event could require curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases  reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans  or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due 
at june   we were not aware of any event that would constitute a default under the facility 
we believe that internally generated funds and our existing aggregate balances in cash and equivalents  in addition to our currently available bank credit arrangements  should be adequate to meet our foreseeable cash requirements 
if we were to borrow outside of our credit facility under current market terms  our average interest rate may increase significantly and have an adverse effect on our results of operations

cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in totaled approximately million  a decrease of as compared with the prior year total of million  which increased from the total of million 
the decrease results from comparatively unfavorable changes in working capital components  especially inventory  prepaid federal income taxes and receivables  as partially offset by a higher level of net income and comparatively favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
most notably  consolidated inventories increased approximately million primarily as a result of anticipating larger seasonal sales of candles and frozen breads in the increase results from a higher level of income from continuing operations and comparatively favorable relative changes in working capital components  especially inventory and prepaid federal income taxes  as partially offset by the comparative pension plan activity and the prior year loss on divestitures  as well as the comparatively unfavorable relative change in accounts payable 
consolidated inventories in declined approximately million from levels primarily due to operational changes  especially within our glassware and candles segment 
net cash from investing activities totaled a use of approximately million in  a use of approximately million in and a source of approximately million for the increase in cash used in investing activities reflects lower proceeds from the sale of property and an increase in capital expenditures in the decrease in cash from investing activities reflects the absence of any divestitures  as partially offset by a lower level of capital expenditures in capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared to million in and million in capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods  for glassware and candles and for corporate 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately to million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to a decrease in treasury share repurchases  the net change in borrowing activity and an increase in the cash overdraft balance 
the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in treasury share repurchases and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock awards  as partially offset by the net change in borrowing activity and a decrease in the cash overdraft balance

the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to per share during  and per share in this past fiscal year marked the th consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares in august approximately  shares from this authorization remained authorized for future purchase at june  the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions

these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation in recent years  we have been exposed to significant fluctuations in certain manufacturing input costs  including materials such as food commodities and paraffin wax 
for  we believe our overall manufacturing costs reflected favorable improvement over prior years  with the year over year contribution derived from lower materials costs approximating of net sales 
these lower costs occurred primarily in the first half of  with our cost comparisons becoming progressively less favorable as the year progressed 
as noted above  some of this benefit was offset by contractual adjustments existing within certain foodservice pricing arrangements 
entering  with respect to material input and freight related fuel costs  on balance  we are experiencing an elevation of such costs over levels 
this is particularly true with respect to paraffin wax costs 
relative to  results were influenced by substantially higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities and candle wax 
the year over year increase in raw material costs for the specialty foods segment was estimated at approximately million 

table of contents our operating results will be impacted by our ability to offset any higher input costs through pricing adjustments with our customers 
over the course of and  we were generally able to adjust various selling prices of food products to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments generally lagged the increase in our costs  having a net positive impact on our operating margins and a net negative impact in we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have typically not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer and consumer demand 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually at april  through asset impairment testing  as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
any changes in that funded status caused by subsequent plan revaluations are recognized through comprehensive income 
we may also experience future plan settlements or curtailments having unanticipated effects on operating results 
recently issued accounting standards there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that impact our consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted accounting standards effective july   we adopted the provisions of a fasb fsp on the fasb s eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which is now part of accounting standards codification asc topic  earnings per share 
this fsp addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting  and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method 
the restricted stock we previously granted to employees was deemed to meet the definition of a participating security as the employees receive nonforfeitable dividends before the stock becomes vested 
our adoption of this fsp required that we retrospectively restate eps and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for all periods 
table of contents presented 
this resulted in a 
reduction in basic and diluted net income per common share for both and see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we adopted fsp no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and ingredient prices 
we have not had exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
rates under our credit facility are set at the time of each borrowing and are based on predetermined formulas connected to certain benchmark rates 
increases in these rates could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows 
at the end of  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
the nature and amount of our borrowings may vary as a result of business requirements  acquisitions  market conditions and other factors 
commodity price risk we purchase a variety of commodities and other materials  such as soybean oil  flour  wax and packaging materials  which we use to manufacture our products 
the market prices for these commodities are subject to fluctuation based upon a number of economic factors and may become volatile at times 
while we do not use any derivative commodity instruments to hedge against commodity price risk  we do actively manage a portion of the risk through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 
this program gives us more predictable input costs  which may help stabilize our margins during periods of volatility in commodity markets
