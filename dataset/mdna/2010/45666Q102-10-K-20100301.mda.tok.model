the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading independent provider of enterprise data integration software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products  including product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  and education services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we also receive a small amount of revenues under subscription based licenses for cloud offerings under the saas model from our customers and partners 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenues outside of europe and north america have comprised or less of total consolidated revenues during the past three years 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  energy and utilities  financial services  government and public agencies  healthcare  high technology  insurance  manufacturing  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation 
despite the uncertainty in the financial markets and the weak macroeconomic environment in the united states and many foreign economies  we were able to grow our total revenues in by to million compared to million in license revenues increased year over year  primarily due to an increase in both the volume of our license transactions and the average sales price of these transactions 
services revenues increased year over year due to growth in maintenance revenues partially offset by a decrease in consulting  education  and other revenues 
the maintenance revenue growth is attributable to the increased size of our installed customer base and the decline in consulting and education service revenues reflects our customers trend toward deferring spending and reducing education and consulting budgets 
our operating income as a percentage of revenues has remained consistent at for both years ended december  and on february   we acquired applimation  a private company incorporated in delaware  providing application information lifecycle management ilm technology 
the acquisition extends our data integration software to include applimation s technology 
we acquired all of the capital stock of applimation in a cash merger transaction valued at approximately million including million retention bonuses payable three to eighteen months subsequent to the acquisition date 
as a result of this acquisition  we also assumed certain facility leases and certain liabilities and commitments 
as part of the merger agreement  million of the merger 
table of contents consideration was placed into an escrow fund and held as security for losses incurred by us in the event of certain breaches of the merger agreement by applimation 
on june   informatica gmbh  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired addressdoctor  a limited liability company duly organized and existing under the laws of the federal republic of germany 
addressdoctor is a leading provider of international address verification and cleaning solutions which enables users to validate and correct postal addresses and assists in the data capturing process 
we acquired all of the capital stock of addressdoctor for million of which million is held in an escrow fund as security for losses incurred by us in the event of certain breaches of the merger agreement by addressdoctor 
the escrow fund will remain in place for a period of eighteen months  although of the escrow funds will be paid out months subsequent to the date of acquisition 
on september   we acquired agent logic  a privately held company incorporated in delaware 
agent logic specializes in the development and marketing of complex event processing software which supports security initiatives in highly complex environments 
we acquired all of the capital stock of agent logic for million of which million is held in an escrow fund as security for losses accrued by informatica in the event of certain breaches of the merger agreement by agent logic 
the escrow fund will remain in place for a period of eighteen months  although of the escrow funds will be paid out months subsequent to the date of acquisition 
in addition  we are obligated to pay certain variable and deferred earn out payments based on the percentage of license revenues recognized subsequent to the acquisition 
on january   we acquired siperian  a private company incorporated in delaware 
siperian provides an integrated model driven master data management mdm platform that adapts to most business requirements 
the acquisition extends our data integration software to include siperian s technology 
we acquired siperian in a cash merger transaction valued at approximately million 
as a result of this acquisition  we also assumed certain facility leases and certain liabilities and commitments 
approximately million of the consideration otherwise payable to former siperian stockholders  vested option holders and participants in siperian s management acquisition bonus plan was placed into an escrow fund and held as partial security for the indemnification obligations of the former siperian stockholders  vested option holders  and participants in siperian s management acquisition bonus plan set forth in the merger agreement and for purposes of the working capital adjustment set forth therein 
the escrow fund will remain in place until july   although of the escrow funds will be distributed to former siperian stockholders  vested option holders  and participants in siperian s management acquisition bonus plan on january  due to our dynamic market  we face both significant opportunities and challenges  and as such  we focus on the following key factors macroeconomic conditions the united states and many foreign economies continue to experience adversity driven by varying macroeconomic conditions including the remaining uncertainty in the credit markets and financial markets  instability of major financial institutions  deterioration in the housing and labor markets and volatility in fuel prices 
as a result of these conditions  the united states and global economies reflect a weak macroeconomic environment  which is expected to continue 
while we have seen improvement in the economy in the united states and parts of europe  the adverse conditions  which are beyond our control  are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our business 
as a result  we have reduced expenses in certain areas and have tempered our hiring plans in areas that have not yet shown macroeconomic improvement 
competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  including solutions from ibm  oracle  and sap  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coding development resources 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry including oracle s acquisition of bea systems  goldengate  hyperion solutions  siebel  silvercreek  and sunopsis  ibm s acquisition of cognos  datamirror  and spss  and its announced plan for acquisition of initiate systems  and sap s acquisition of business objects  which had previously acquired firstlogic could pose challenges as competitors market a broader suite of software products or solutions to our prospective customers 
new product introductions to address the expanding data integration and data integrity needs of our customers and prospective customers  we continue to introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis 
in august  we delivered the powercenter cloud edition to enable our customers to procure powercenter functionality from amazon web services by the hour 
in november   we released informatica cloud in december  we delivered a version upgrade to our entire data integration platform by delivering the generally available version of informatica new product introductions and or enhancements have inherent risks including  but not limited to  product availability  product quality and interoperability  and customer adoption or the delay in customer purchases 
given these risks and the recent introduction of these products  we cannot predict their impact on our overall sales and revenues 

table of contents quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and are likely to do so in the future 
specifically  it is normal for us to recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks or days of each quarter  though such fluctuations are mitigated somewhat by recognition of backlog orders 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest level of license revenues and order backlog  and we generally have weaker demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters of the year 
the current macroeconomic conditions make our historical seasonal trends more difficult to predict 
to address these potential risks  we have focused on a number of key initiatives  including certain cost containment measures  the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide  and the targeting of our sales force and distribution channel on new products  and strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
we are concentrating on maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  and strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
in september  we announced an expanded partnership with hewlett packard 
in september  we also announced that intel will embed informatica bb data transformation in its intel soa expressway offering 
we are partners with fast acquired by microsoft  sap  oracle  hyperion solutions acquired by oracle  and salesforce 
com 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in part i  item a 
we have broadened our distribution efforts  and we have continued to expand our sales both in terms of selling data warehouse products to the enterprise level and of selling more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including data quality  master data management  cross enterprise data exchange  information lifecycle management  complex event processing  and cloud data integration to our customers enterprise architects and chief information officers 
we have expanded our international sales presence in recent years by opening new offices  increasing headcount  and through acquisitions 
as a result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states  our sales and marketing expenses have increased 
in the long term  we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability  although we experienced a tougher than expected selling environment in certain regions in if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in sales productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then it is unlikely that we will achieve our expected increases in revenue  sales productivity  or profitability from our international operations 
we have experienced some increases in revenues and sales productivity in the united states in the past few years 
in the second half of  we experienced increases in revenues internationally  but we have not yet achieved the same level of sales productivity internationally as domestically 
to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiations  and key business values 
these programs include user conferences for customers and partners  a world tour of user days for our customers  prospects and partners for the informatica launch  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel in january  webinars for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
we have also invested in partner enablement programs  including product specific briefings to partners and the inclusion of several partners in our beta programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments  and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments  and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities 
table of contents restructuring charges  income taxes  impairment of goodwill  acquisitions  share based payments  and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of such rules 
these rules and their interpretations are often subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition process requires management to make significant judgments  for example  to determine if collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  professional services  consisting of consulting and education services  and other revenues  consisting of software subscription  and cloud services revenues 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenues 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by fasb software revenue recognition asc  fasb revenue recognition for construction type and production type contracts asc  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which is discussed in the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized at each period 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
we require evidence of sell through from resellers and distributors for order acceptance 
we then recognize revenue from resellers and distributors upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met  which in substantially all cases is upon collection 
further  we make judgments in determining the collectibility of the amounts due from our customers that could possibly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectibility  and when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
our software license arrangements include the following multiple elements license fees from our core software products and or product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered software product element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered services elements of the arrangement  all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  then software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation of services and product configurations 
these services are performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee 
table of contents consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
other revenues  consisting of software subscription  and cloud services revenues  are recognized as the services are performed 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we recognize revenues net of applicable sales taxes  financing charges that we have absorbed  and amounts retained by our resellers and distributors  if any 
our agreements do not permit returns  and historically we have not had any significant returns or refunds  therefore  we have not established a sales return reserve at this time 
facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduce our operating expenses 
the accrued restructuring charges represent net present value of lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the probability weighted outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the global economic downturn  time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases  and market rates at the time of subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities in connection with our and facilities restructuring but for durations that are generally less than the remaining lease terms 
if we determine that there is a change in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time it will take us to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
see note facilities restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the expected time it will take to sublease 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb income taxes asc 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with asc the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been taken into account with the exception of revaluing deferred taxes for california relating to and thereafter 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance  we considered all the evidence available to us  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

table of contents as a result of this analysis for the year ended december   consistent with prior years it was considered more likely than not that our non share based payments related deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  the remaining valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred tax assets that were created through the benefit from stock option deductions on a with and without basis and recorded on the balance sheet with a corresponding valuation allowance prior to our adoption of fasb stock compensation asc 
accounting for impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with fasb intangibles goodwill and other asc  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by asc consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit 
we test goodwill for impairment in our annual impairment test on october of each year  using the two step process required by asc first  we review the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
second  if such comparison reflects potential impairment  we would then perform the discounted cash flow analyses 
these analyses are based on cash flow assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
an excess of the carrying value to fair value might indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
finally  if we determine that goodwill might have been impaired  then we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by asc  to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we determined in our annual impairment tests on october    and that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and  accordingly  determined that goodwill had not been impaired and is not at risk of failing 
we have made assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives which are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends as well as internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe that the assumptions and estimates that we have made are sound and reasonable  but nevertheless the result of our financial operations would have been materially different if we hade made different assumptions and estimates 
acquisitions in accordance with fasb business combinations asc  we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as to in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities  and pre acquisition contingencies 
a number of events could potentially affect the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  nevertheless a level of uncertainty is inherent in all such decisions 
the following are some of the examples of critical accounting estimates that we have applied in our acquisitions future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated 
table of contents costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs to provide product upgrades on a when and if available to basis in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
accounting for business combinations has been impacted by asc under the new accounting pronouncement  we expense transaction costs and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition as incurred 
in contrast  we treated transaction costs and restructuring expenses as part of the cost of the acquired business previously  thus effectively capitalizing those amounts within the basis of the acquired assets 
further  pursuant to asc  we identify pre acquisition contingencies and determine their respective fair values as of the end of the purchase price allocation period 
we will adjust the amounts recorded as pre acquisition contingencies in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
furthermore  any adjustment applicable to acquisition related tax contingencies estimates will be reflected in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
moreover  we identify the in process research and development costs and determine their respective fair values and reflect them as part of the purchase price allocation 
in process research and development costs  under the new guidance  meet the definition of asset  and we classify them as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the asset is put to use or deemed to be impaired 
share based payments we account for share based payments related to share based transactions in accordance with the provisions of fasb stock compensation asc 
accordingly  share based payment is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably on a straight line basis over its requisite service period 
it requires a certain amount of judgment to select the appropriate fair value model and calculate the fair value of share based awards  including estimating stock price volatility and expected life 
further  estimates of forfeiture rates could shift the share based payments from one period to the next 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility was based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price that we have used consistently since the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payments asc in our volatility rates were   and for   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due to a decline in the implied components of our volatility rates 
the increase in from was due to fluctuations in our stock price during the latter part of our historical volatility in compared to and compared to remained relatively unchanged 
our implied volatility rates in declined compared to and in increased compared to to the extent that the volatility rate in our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted will increase accordingly 
we do not expect that changes in the volatility rates to impact our future share based payments materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 
we derived our expected life of the options that we granted in from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises and cancellations for vested and unvested options that remain outstanding 
we increased our expected life estimate from years in to years in the higher expected life of options was mainly due to lower exercises in we do not expect that changes in the expected life to impact our future share based payments materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate in determining the amount of share based payments 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on an average of actual forfeited options granted to new employees for the past four quarters 
we lowered our forfeiture rate  for the quarter ended march   from to  which increased our share based payments in the first quarter of by approximately  the forfeiture rate for the last three quarters of remained unchanged from the first quarter of we have granted restricted stock units rsus to our executive officers  certain employees  and directors in we have recorded the share based payment for rsus net of the forfeiture estimate 
we estimate our forfeiture rate for rsus based on an average of actual forfeited option awards for the past four quarters 

table of contents we believe that the estimates that we have used for the calculation of the variables to arrive at share based payments are accurate 
we will  however  continue to monitor the historical performance of these variables and will modify our methodology and assumptions in the future as needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  and return and discount experiences 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of income and cash flows 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively

we expect international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in to be relatively consistent with potential future revenues new orders  backlog  and deferred revenue our potential future revenues include backlog consisting primarily of product license orders that have not shipped as of the end of a given quarter  orders received from certain distributors  resellers  and oems  not included in deferred revenues  where revenue is recognized based on cash receipt collectively and above are referred as aggregate backlog  and deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of the following maintenance revenues that we recognize over the term of the contract  typically one year  license product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the license agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the license revenues be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met or recognized ratably over an extended period  and consulting and education services revenues that have been prepaid but for which services have not yet been performed 
we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry  and historically our backlog of license orders awaiting shipment at the end of any given quarter has varied 
however  our backlog historically decreases from the prior quarter at the end of the first and third quarters and increases at the end of the fourth quarter 
the increase  however  was less pronounced at the end of aggregate backlog and deferred revenues at december  were approximately million compared to million at december  this increase in was primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenues and an increase in license backlog 
backlog and deferred revenues  as of any particular date  are not necessarily indicative of future results

cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting  education  and other services revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees for maintenance related to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of education services revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing education classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices  and customer locations 
cost of other services revenue consists primarily of fees paid to postal authorities and other third parties for content 
cost of service revenues was million or of service revenues in  million or of service revenues in  and million or of service revenues in the million or decrease in from was primarily due to a million reduction in reimbursable expenses  a million reduction in subcontractor fees  and million reduction in personnel related costs related to consulting and education services  offset by a million increase in share based payments 
the reduction in consulting and education services costs is as a result of corresponding lower revenues in consulting and education services in compared to the million or increase in from was proportional to the increase in service revenues and was primarily due to higher subcontractor fees in our consulting services group and headcount growth primarily in the customer support group 
the headcount in customer support  professional services  and education services groups grew from in to in we expect that our cost of service revenues  in absolute dollars  to increase in from the levels  mainly due to headcount increases associated with increased service revenues

our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services  and facilities and related costs 
we have also used cash to purchase property and equipment  repurchase common stock from the open market to reduce the dilutive impact of stock option issuances  repurchase our convertible senior notes  and acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings

our revised and more conservative investment strategy has not impacted our liquidity 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
due to the nature of these transactions  it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements

the escrow fund will remain in place for a period of months  although of the escrow funds will be paid out months subsequent to the date of acquisition 
in addition  we are obligated to pay certain variable and deferred earn out payments if certain license order targets are achieved 
on january   we acquired siperian  a private company incorporated in delaware in a cash merger transaction valued at approximately million 
due to the nature of mergers and acquisitions  it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of cash requirements to complete such transactions 
we may be required to raise additional funds to complete future acquisitions 
as of june  we were no longer required to maintain certificates of deposits for the million letter of credit that a financial institution issued in for our former corporate headquarters leases at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
accordingly  we classified the release of such restricted cash associated with such certificates of deposits from investing activities to operating activities 
financing activities we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million due to the proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of our espp program for million and million of excess tax benefits from share based payments

net cash provided by financing activities in was million due to the issuance of common stock to option holders and to participants of our espp program for million  and million of excess tax benefits from share based payments  which were partially offset by a million repurchase and retirement of common stock 

table of contents although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and overall market conditions 
in march  we issued and sold convertible senior notes notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of  shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock or convertible senior notes 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock at any time until april from april to april   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million

in october  informatica s board of directors authorized  under the existing stock repurchase program  the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding notes due in in privately negotiated transactions with holders of the notes 
from april to december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million and million of our outstanding notes at a cost of million 
we have approximately million remaining available to repurchase shares of our common stock or convertible senior notes under this program as of december  in january  our board of directors approved an additional million for the stock repurchase program 
this repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from our available cash 
the primary purpose of these programs is to enhance shareholder value by partially offsetting the dilutive impact of stock based incentive plans 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases are based on several factors  including the price of our common stock  our liquidity and working capital needs  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchased shares are retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
see part ii  item of this report for more information regarding the stock repurchase program 
we may continue to repurchase shares and convertible senior notes from time to time  as determined by management as authorized by the board of directors 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required to raise or desire additional funds for selective purposes  such as acquisitions  and may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
after march   we may from time to time redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash  at a redemption price equal to the full principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
further  on march  and then upon march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control  holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the full principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest as of the relevant date

the above commitment table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with fasb income taxes asc 
we adopted fin no 
asc effective january  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these potential future payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
for further information  see note income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
we estimate the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
during  we recorded facilities restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in redwood city  california 
operating lease payments in the table above include approximately million  net of actual sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in accrued facilities restructuring charges 
see note facilities restructuring charges and note commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
of these future minimum lease payments  we have million recorded in accrued facilities restructuring charges at december  this accrual  in addition to minimum lease payments of million  includes estimated operating expenses of million  is net of estimated sublease income of million  and is net of the present value impact of million recorded in accordance with fasb accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities asc 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different 
we have sublease agreements for leased office space at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
we expect at this time that the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under the terms of the current lease agreements 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december these two lease agreements will expire in july off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or relationships with special purpose entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency  except for informatica cayman ltd  which is in euros 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign 
table of contents currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the indian rupee  israeli shekel  euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  brazilian real  and australian dollar 
cash flow hedge activities we have attempted to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations through initiation of certain cash flow hedge programs starting in the fourth quarter of the purpose of these programs is to reduce volatility in cash flows and expenses caused by movement in certain foreign currency exchange rates  in particular the indian rupee and israeli shekel
