federal regulation privacy  security and other hipaa requirements the use  disclosure and secure handling of individually identifiable health information by our business is regulated at the federal level  including the privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and privacy and security regulations pursuant to hipaa 
further  our privacy and security practices are subject to various state laws and regulations 
varying requirements and enforcement approaches in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
these state and federal requirements change frequently as a result of legislation  regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra broadened the scope of the hipaa privacy and security regulations 
among other things  arra strengthened the enforcement provisions of hipaa  which may result in increased enforcement activity 
under arra  the department of health and human services dhhs is required to conduct periodic compliance audits of entities covered by the hipaa regulations  known as covered entities  and their business associates entities that handle identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities 
additionally  arra mandates that if a member requests a copy of their medical record  it must be provided to them 
doctor s notes  medical test results  lab results and billing information fall within this mandate 
many of our business operations are considered to be covered entities under hipaa  while others are classified as business associates 
arra broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty provisions under hipaa to employees of covered entities and requires dhhs to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect 
arra also significantly increases the amount of the civil penalties  with penalties of up to  per hipaa violation for a maximum civil penalty of  in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement 
in addition  arra authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents 
further  arra extends the application of certain provisions of the hipaa security and privacy regulations to business associates and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations 
state and local authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft  with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information 
as required by arra  dhhs published an interim final rule on august   that requires covered entities to report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay  but not to exceed days of recovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents 
notification must also be made to dhhs and  in certain situations involving large breaches  to the media 
hipaa includes administrative requirements directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions and establishing uniform health care provider  payer and employer identifiers 
hipaa also imposes obligations for health insurance issuers and health benefit plan sponsors 
hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers having two to employees and for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements 
hipaa also requires guaranteed renewability of health coverage for most employers and individuals and contains nondiscrimination requirements 
hipaa limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions for individuals covered under group policies to the extent the individuals had prior creditable coverage 
failure to comply with any of the statutory and regulatory hipaa requirements  state privacy and security requirements and other similar federal requirements could subject us to significant penalties 
erisa the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
for instance  the us department of labor regulations under erisa insured and self insured regulate the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establish requirements for plan responses to appeals and expand required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
medicare and medicaid some of our subsidiaries contract with cms to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare advantage program 
some of our health plans also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations 
cms periodically performs risk adjustment data validation radv audits for any health plan operating under a medicare managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law and contractual obligations 
additionally  in some instances states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicare managed care plans 
our health plans are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
cms rules require medicaid managed care plans to have beneficiary protections and protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  states must assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
states and plans must identify enrollees with special health care needs and assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
these requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
the federal anti kickback statute imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including the medicare  medicaid and fehb programs 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or in part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 
with respect to the federal anti kickback statute  there exists a statutory exception and two safe harbors addressing certain risk sharing arrangements 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our subsidiaries to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
cms has promulgated regulations that prohibit health plans with medicare contracts from including any direct or indirect payment to physicians or other providers as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services to a medicare beneficiary 
these regulations impose disclosure and other requirements relating to physician incentive plans such as bonuses or withholds that could result in a physician being at substantial financial risk as defined in medicare regulations 
our ability to maintain compliance with such regulations depends  in part  on our receipt of timely and accurate information from our providers 
although we believe we are in compliance with all such medicare regulations  we are subject to future audit and review 
the federal false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting false claims to the federal government 
private individuals known as relators or whistleblowers may bring actions on the government s behalf under the false claims act and share in any settlement or judgment 
violations of the federal false claims act may result in treble damages and civil penalties of up to  for each false claim 
in some cases  whistleblowers  the federal government and some courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such as the federal anti kickback statute have thereby submitted false claims under the false claims act 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the false claims act by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly or improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
under the deficit reduction act of defra  every entity that receives at least million annually in medicaid payments must establish written policies for all employees  contractors or agents  providing detailed information about false claims  false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws  including the federal false claims act  and similar state laws 
we have established written policies that we believe comply with this provision of defra 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
defra creates an incentive for states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal false claims act 
from time to time  companies in the healthcare industry  including ours  may be subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws 
in july  the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  commonly called mippa  became law 
mippa increased restrictions on marketing and sales activities of medicare advantage plans  including limitations on compensation systems for agents and brokers  limitations on solicitation of beneficiaries  and prohibitions regarding many sales activities 
mippa also imposed restrictions on special needs plans  increased penalties for reimbursement delays under part d  required weekly reporting of pricing standards by medicare part d plans  and implemented focused cuts to certain medicare advantage programs 
the congressional budget office estimated that the mippa would reduce federal spending on medicare advantage plans by billion over the period 
failure to comply with mippa or the regulations promulgated pursuant to mippa could result in penalties including suspension of enrollment  suspension of payment  suspension of marketing  fines and or civil monetary penalties 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the united states office of personnel management opm and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the federal employees health benefits program 
these contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the office of the inspector general oig of opm who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with opm 
for our managed care contracts  the oig conducts periodic audits to  among other things  verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the fehb program 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
for our experience rated plans  the oig focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges  the effectiveness of claims processing  financial and cost accounting systems  and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments 
the oig may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans 
these audits are generally a number of years in arrears 
managed care legislative proposals in the final months of  both houses of the us congress passed separate bills intended to reform the healthcare system 
while neither of these bills has yet become law  such laws or similar proposals have been  and we anticipate may continue to be  a focus at the federal level 
several states are also considering healthcare reform measures 
this focus on healthcare reform  including managed care reform  may increase the likelihood of significant changes affecting the managed care industry and our business 
at this time  it is unclear as to when any reform proposals might be enacted or the content of any new legislation  and we cannot predict the effect on our operations of proposed legislation or any other reform proposals that may be adopted 
risk management in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims for medical services denied by the company  medical malpractice actions  employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we maintain general liability  professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate  with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
the professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary 
employees at january   we employed approximately  persons  none of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item a risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
accordingly  costs we incur in excess of our cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
we estimate our costs of future benefit claims and related expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  inflation  historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors 
we also record benefits payable for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
these estimates involve extensive judgment  and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiations of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophic events  including epidemics and natural disasters  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other legislative or regulatory changes that increase our costs  clusters of high cost cases  changes in or new technology  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical liabilities in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and reported but not paid claims 
the estimates for medical liabilities are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for medical liabilities are adequate  but we cannot assure you of this 
increases from our current estimates of liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 
general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our business  results of operations and investment portfolio 
worldwide financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions  including extraordinarily volatile stock prices and diminished liquidity and availability of credit 
together with the current recessionary environment in the us and abroad and other unfavorable economic developments such as high unemployment  these developments could adversely affect our business  results of operations and investment portfolio 
for instance  a decline in members covered under our plans could result from layoffs and downsizing or the elimination of health benefits by employers seeking to cut costs 
economic conditions could cause our existing members to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or could  in addition to significant membership loss  result in lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership 
in addition  the economic downturn could negatively affect our employer group renewals and our ability to increase premiums 
the state of the economy also adversely affects the states budgets  which can result in states attempting to reduce payments to medicaid plans in those states in which we offer medicaid plans  and to increase taxes and assessments on our activities 
although we could attempt to mitigate our exposure from such increased costs through  among other things  increases in premiums  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
a drop in the prices of securities across global financial markets could negatively affect our investment portfolio 
some of our investments could further experience other than temporary declines in fair value  requiring us to record impairment charges that adversely impact our financial results 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations or alleged violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  require coverage of pre existing conditions  limit premium levels or establish minimum medical expense ratios for certain products  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  increase government sponsorship of competing health plans  impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  impose fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews  prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks  prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization  including any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  limit contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials  and impose additional health care information privacy or security requirements 
congress and state legislatures continue to focus on health care issues and to consider major changes that would affect both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements 
the us house of representatives and the us senate each passed healthcare reform bills at the end of  however neither of these bills has yet become law 
the bills and other reform measures under consideration include proposals that would result in significant new taxes on the health insurance industry and or on employers offering certain plans  immediately effective market reforms such as a ban on lifetime limits  new benefit mandates  increased dependant coverage and limits on pre existing condition exclusions  expansion of eligibility under existing medicaid and or fehbp programs  minimum medical benefit ratios for health plans  new individual insurance requirements  medicare advantage funding cuts  administrative cost caps  and new government run plans or insurance exchanges 
these or other changes could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition 
in addition  several states are considering legislative proposals that could impact our ability to obtain appropriate premium rates and that would mandate certain benefits and forbid certain policy provisions  or otherwise materially adversely impact our business operations and financial condition 
we also may be subject to governmental investigations or inquiries from time to time 
the existence of such investigations in our industry could negatively affect the market value of all companies in our industry including our stock price 
as a result of recent investigations  including audits  cms has imposed sanctions and fines including immediate suspension of all enrollment and marketing activities and civil monetary penalties on certain medicare advantage plans run by our competitors 
in addition  qui tam suits brought by whistleblowers have resulted in significant settlements 
any similar governmental investigations of coventry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business or result in significant liabilities to the company  as well as adverse publicity 
changes to laws may impact our ability to enroll beneficiaries and the viability of certain of our medicare advantage plans 
mippa imposes restrictions on the ability to market medicare advantage and pdps 
we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to offer many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by changes in government funding for medicare and medicaid 
the federal government and many states from time to time consider altering the level of funding for government healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the defra included medicaid cuts of approximately billion over five years 
mippa reduced federal spending on the medicare advantage program by billion over the period 
in addition  mippa mandated that the medicare payment advisory commission report on both the quality of care provided under medicare advantage plans and the cost to the medicare program of such plans 
current healthcare reform proposals would impose additional cuts to the medicare advantage program 
additional proposed regulatory changes would  if implemented  further reduce federal medicaid funding 
we cannot predict future medicare or medicaid funding levels or ensure that changes to medicare or medicaid funding will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include competition in premium or plan benefits from other health care benefit companies  reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  adverse economic conditions  our increases in premiums or benefit changes  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally  and catastrophic events  including natural disasters  epidemics  man made catastrophes  and other unforeseen occurrences 
our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional managed care businesses and successfully integrate those businesses into our operations 
part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans and other managed care businesses 
historically  we have significantly increased our revenues through a number of acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates  obtain required governmental approvals  successfully integrate the businesses we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings 
the businesses we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability 
our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions 
in such acquisitions  we may assume liabilities that could adversely affect our business 
additionally  we may issue stock in connection with such acquisitions  which would result in dilution to existing stockholders  or we could incur debt to finance such acquisitions 
competition may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives such as self insurance  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we compete with other managed care companies that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  larger contracting scale  lower costs and or greater financial and other resources 
we also may face increased rate competition from certain blue cross plan competitors that might be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that may be deemed excessive 
the non renewal or termination of our government contracts  or unsuccessful bids for business with government agencies  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our contracts with state government programs are subject to renewal  terminations and competitive bidding procedures 
in particular  the contract between our healthcare usa subsidiary and the missouri medicaid program  mo healthnet  runs from october  through june  this contract is subject to two successive one year extensions running through june   if mo healthnet so elects 
if we are unable to renew or successfully re bid for this and or other of our state contracts  or if such contracts were terminated or renewed on less favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  on may   we notified cms of our intention to cease offering pffs products 
this non renewal took effect at the end of the term of this current year  december  we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we cannot assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers  who typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we cannot assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner 
if we fail to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers we may experience higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in addition  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets  and our ability to contract at competitive rates with our ppo and workers compensation related providers will affect the attractiveness and profitability of our products in the national account  network rental and workers compensation businesses 
in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiations 
we cannot assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally  or our company in particular  could adversely affect our results of operations or business 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to a significant amount of negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally  or our company in particular  may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services to employers  individuals or other customers 
negative publicity relating to our company also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 
a failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our information technology systems for timely and accurate information 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information technology systems or disruptions in our information technology systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
cms periodically performs radv audits and may seek return of premium payments made to the company if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by medical record data 
we estimate and record reserves for cms audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates related to the amount of hierarchical condition category hcc revenue subject to audit and anticipated error rates 
although we believe the company maintains appropriate reserves for its exposure to the radv audits  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
accordingly  cms audit results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories that could adversely affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of non covered benefits  vicarious liability for medical malpractice claims filed against our providers  disputes with our providers alleging rico and antitrust violations  disputes with our providers over reimbursement and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our co payment calculations  customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations  and disputes over payments for out of network benefits 
we describe certain litigation to which we have been parties in note l  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event a plaintiff was to obtain a significant damage award it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
currently  professional liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary 
potential liabilities that we incur may not  however  be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry  may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets and the economy in general may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes or proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness imposes certain restrictions on our business and operations 
the indentures for our senior notes and bank credit agreement impose restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends  repurchase common stock  or make other restricted payments  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness will depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate the cash necessary to service our indebtedness is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
in addition  we will be more vulnerable to economic downturns  adverse industry conditions and competitive pressures as a result of our significant indebtedness 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms 
a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our regulated subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries conduct a substantial amount of our consolidated operations 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt and fund future acquisitions depends  in part  on the amount of cash that the parent company receives from our regulated subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to the parent company will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to hmo and insurance regulations that require them to meet or exceed various capital standards and may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make cash transfers to the parent company 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying the parent company dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to the parent company  it could have a material adverse effect on the parent company s cash flow

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
among other things  these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting  provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares  provide that amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our results of operations and shareholders equity could be materially adversely affected if we have an impairment of our intangible assets 
due largely to our past acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our total assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   representing approximately of our total assets 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we perform periodic assessments of our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
this impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
fair value is calculated using a blend of a projected income and market value approach 
estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other assumptions and estimates were to be used 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
our efforts to capitalize on medicare business opportunities could prove to be unsuccessful 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our managed care premium revenue in in connection with the passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the drug act and the drug act s implementing regulations adopted in  we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team and operations to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the drug act and the medicare program generally 
particular risks associated with our providing medicare part d prescription drug benefits under the drug act include potential uncollectability of receivables  inadequacy of underwriting assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business 
in  we expanded our medicare programs 
specifically  we expanded our medicare part d prescription drug benefits plans to all states  and enhanced our hmo ppo product offerings 
all of these growth activities required substantial administrative and operational capabilities 
if we are unable to maintain the administrative and operational capabilities to address the additional needs and increasing regulation of our remaining medicare programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business and operating results 
in addition  if the cost or complexity of the recent medicare changes exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the drug act s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this item contains forward looking statements as described in part i 
these forward looking statements involved risks and uncertainties described in part i  item a  risk factors 
the organization of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is as follows executive level overview critical accounting policies new accounting standards acquisitions membership results of operations liquidity and capital resources other disclosures executive level overview general operations we are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in bethesda  maryland  operating health plans  insurance companies  network rental and workers compensation services companies 
through our health plan and medical services business  specialized managed care business  and workers compensation divisions  we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals  employer and government funded groups  government agencies  and other insurance carriers and administrators 
summary of performance revenues from continuing operations increased from the prior year medicare part d membership growth of  from the prior year  an increase of health plan commercial group risk medical loss ratio of cash flow from operations was million debt reduction of million from the prior year resulting in a debt to capital ratio at year end operating earnings as a percentage of total revenue were  compared to in the prior year income from continuing operations was million  a decline of from income from continuing operations diluted eps from continuing operations was  a decline of from diluted eps from continuing operations operating revenue and products we operate health plans  insurance companies  managed care services companies  and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products 
managed care premiums for our commercial risk products  for which we assume full underwriting risk  can vary 
for example  premiums for our ppo and pos products are typically lower than our hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the ppo and pos members 
managed care premium rates for our government programs  medicare and state sponsored managed medicaid  are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies 
these government products are offered in select markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 
revenue for our management services products non risk is generally a fixed administrative fee  provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis  for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services  for which we do not assume underwriting risk 
the management services we provide typically include health care provider network management  clinical management  pharmacy benefit management pbm  bill review  claims repricing  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
operating expenses we incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk 
our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements 
medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs 
drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies 
drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs 
we have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services such as laboratory services and in some cases physician and radiology services 
a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members 
under some capitated arrangements  physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization 
we are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements 
to the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements  we will be required to perform such obligations 
consequently  we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements 
medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately of the company s total medical costs for the year ended december  we have established systems to monitor the availability  appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide 
we collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner 
medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate 
each health plan collects data showing each physician s utilization profile for diagnostic tests  specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plan s physicians 
the medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically  cost effective appropriate services 
we incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers 
these costs are associated with fee based products 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products 
to a lesser extent  our selling  general and administration expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services 
we operate regional service centers that perform claims processing  premium billing and collection  enrollment and customer service functions 
our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale  implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems 
cash flows we generate cash through operations 
as a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive  we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations 
our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims 
any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions  to prepay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions  or other changes 
due to early timing of the premium billing  we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments included on two subsequent months billings 
current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments 
based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings  historical trends  bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts  we estimate  on a monthly basis  the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly 
as of december   we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately million compared with approximately million at december  we also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables 
we receive premium payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a monthly basis for our medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members 
premiums are fixed subject to retroactive risk adjustment on an annual basis by contracts with cms 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and can result in adjustments to revenue 
cms uses a risk adjustment model that incorporates the use of hcc codes to determine premium payments to health plans 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the diagnosis data submitted to cms 
changes in revenue from cms resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustments scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
cms periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to the company if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by medical record data 
we estimate and record reserves for cms audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates related to the amount of hcc revenue subject to audit and anticipated error rates 
although we believe the company maintains appropriate reserves for its exposure to the risk adjustment data validation radv audits  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we contract with the united states office of personnel management opm and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the office of the inspector general oig of opm  which performs periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with opm 
for our managed care contracts  the oig conducts periodic audits to  among other things  verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
for our experience rated plans  the oig focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges  the effectiveness of claims processing  financial and cost accounting systems  and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments 
the oig may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans 
these audits are generally a number of years in arrears 
we estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both our managed care contracts and our experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 
we enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards 
these standards vary widely and could involve customer service  member satisfaction  claims processing  claims accuracy  telephone response time  etc 
we also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including  among others  achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold  achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets 
for each guarantee  we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation 
pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts 
medical claims expense and liabilities medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported 
medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider  among other things  historical claims payment patterns  provider reimbursement changes  historical utilization trends  current levels of authorized inpatient days  other medical cost inflation factors  membership levels  benefit design changes  seasonality  demographic mix change and other relevant factors 
we employ a team of actuaries that have developed  refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years 
these reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported  but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities 
these reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities 
within these models  historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates 
this information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred 
completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period 
actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims 
actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims 
in many situations  the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate 
adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or  as we experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims 
we believe that this favorable development has been a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands 
medical liabilities  beginning of year acquisitions reported medical costs current year prior year development total reported medical costs claim payments payments for current year payments for prior year total claim payments change in part d related subsidy liabilities medical liabilities  end of year supplemental information prior year development current year paid percent acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date 
prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs 
current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs 
the negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated 
as noted above  these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends 
medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider 
accordingly  the prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year the significant favorable unfavorable factors driving the overall favorable prior year development for include lower than anticipated medical cost increases of million favorable development lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of million favorable development lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of million favorable development higher than expected completion factors of million favorable development higher than expected inpatient hospital utilization of million unfavorable development higher than anticipated membership of million unfavorable development the increase in total reported medical cost from to was driven primarily by growth in the medical cost base of the company due to the growth in part d and pffs membership and partially due to medical cost inflation 
prior year development experienced in was less favorable compared to amounts experienced in and the lower favorable development is primarily attributable to our pffs line of business 
pffs experienced unfavorable development in due to lower than expected completion factors 
the change in medicare part d related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represents subsidy amounts received from cms for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals 
these subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies 
for the more recent incurred months  the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low 
as a result  the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months 
for that reason  incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns 
instead  they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels  or trend factors 
as these months mature over time  the two estimates completion factor and trend are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months 
within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services  we use certain assumptions 
for inpatient services  authorized days are used for utilization factors  while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts 
the per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix 
for non inpatient services  a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service  provider contracts  utilization and other factors 
changes in the completion factors  trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability 
the following example in thousands  except percentages provides the estimated effect to our december  unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion  trend  and inpatient day factors 
while we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable  certain factors and actual results may differ 
completion factor claims trend factor inpatient day factor increase decrease in completion factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in claims trend factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in inpatient day factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
a regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and if appropriate  the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience 
our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of december  by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience 
we believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december  however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
investments we account for investments in accordance with asc topic investments debt and equity securities 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or geographic area  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
when we determine that a decline in fair value below amortized cost is judged to be other than temporary we are required to recognize the credit loss component as a charge in net earnings 
included in net earnings is the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment charge 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
we use prices from independent pricing services and  to a lesser extent  indicative non binding quotes from independent brokers  to measure the fair value of our investment securities 
we utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values  however  we generally obtain one price quote for each individual security 
we perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
examples of the procedures performed include  but are not limited to  an on going review of pricing service methodologies  review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness 
we monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active 
as further validation  we sample a security s past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data  which happens infrequently  the price of the security is adjusted accordingly 
generally  we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers  unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with asc topic based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services  we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in asc topic the following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at december  for these investments  the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position in thousands 
less than months months or more total description of securities fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses state and municipal bonds us treasury securities government sponsored enterprises residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities asset backed securities corporate debt and other securities total the unrealized losses presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements and significant increases in volatility and liquidity concerns in the securities and credit markets 
the company does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before a recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities 
our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits excluding monoline insurers 
although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality  million of our million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer 
for our mortgaged backed and asset backed securities  our holdings remain at investment grade with a aaa rating and aa rating  respectively 
we participate in only the higher level investment tranches 
for our asset backed securities  we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment 
goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets goodwill goodwill is subject to an annual assessment and periodically if other indicators are present for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we performed a goodwill impairment analysis  at the reporting unit level  as of october  our annual impairment test date 
however  each year we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment 
those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  regulatory actions such as heath care reform that may impact operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
for our impairment analysis we relied on both the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
the market approach estimates a business s fair value by comparing our company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies 
the approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality 
in the case of a publicly traded company  the objective of the market capitalization approach is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units 
in addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization  we considered factors outlined in asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other including the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available  the market price of an individual equity security and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  and the quoted market price of an individual equity security  therefore  need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit 
as of october  our market capitalization was below our book value which we considered in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill 
we concluded that this did not affect the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe our suppressed market capitalization to be primarily attributed to negative market conditions as a result of the credit crisis  the economic recession  debate over health care reform and current pricing and or medical trend issues within the managed care industry 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets  it is possible a material change could occur 
under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates  capital expenditures  discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations 
we also assume a control premium that is reasonable based on our assessment of control premiums of entities of a similar size and or in a similar industry 
if the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results  the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 
as discussed in note e  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded an impairment charge of million during related to the sale of fhsc 
other intangible assets in accordance with asc  general intangibles other than goodwill  we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have chosen october as our annual impairment testing date 
our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a trade name which we determined was not impaired based on the result of the october  analysis 
also in accordance with asc we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists  licenses  and provider networks 
based on events and circumstances  primarily lower than expected customer retention levels  we recorded million in impairment charges to certain customer list balances in see note e  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets 
other long lived assets in accordance with asc  we periodically review long lived assets for recoverability whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist  and if so  estimate fair value 
we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life  including accelerating depreciation for these assets 
our other long lived assets consist of property and equipment which are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life  and are subject to impairment reviews 
in accordance with asc  internal use software  the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment 
we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software 
these costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
we have not incurred an impairment charge related to our long lived assets 
see note f  property and equipment  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to these assets 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
therefore  the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

membership the following table presents our membership as of december  and in thousands 
as of december  membership by product health plan commercial risk health plan commercial aso medicare advantage ccp medicaid risk health plan total medicare advantage pffs other national risk other national aso total medical membership medicare part d total membership total health plan membership decreased  primarily due to membership losses in commercial risk 
during  the growth in national unemployment resulted in an acceleration of in group health plan commercial risk membership attrition compared to additionally  the commercial membership declined as a result of premium pricing increases related to the higher medical cost experienced in the increase in medicare advantage ccp membership is primarily due to the result of our successful annual election period and open enrollment period for and also due to age ins 
other national aso membership decreased by  primarily due to the attrition of membership associated with our loss of national accounts business compared to the increases in medicare part d membership of  and medicare advantage pffs of  were primarily the result of our successful annual election period and open enrollment period for in the second quarter of  we decided not to renew our pffs product effective for the plan year 
our pffs product represented billion in revenue for the year ended december  results of continuing operations as discussed in note d  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements  on july  the company sold its medicaid public entity business first health services corporation fhsc and therefore its operations are classified as discontinued on the company s consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the information below 
accordingly  the amounts and discussion below relate to only the company s results from continuing operations for all years presented 
the following table is provided to facilitate a discussion regarding the comparison of our consolidated results of continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars in thousands  except diluted earnings per share amounts increase increase continuing operations decrease decrease total operating revenues operating earnings operating earnings as a of revenue income from continuing operations diluted earnings per share selling  general and administrative as a percentage of revenue comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased primarily as a result of higher membership in our medicare business in part d  pffs  and ccp as a result of successful enrollment for the revenue increases were also a result of increased individual membership 
partially offsetting this increase was lower revenue for our commercial risk business due to membership declines 
management services revenue increased primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the workers compensation division 
medical costs increased primarily as a result of the increase in medicare membership  as discussed above 
total medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue  medical loss ratio  or mlr increased over the prior year as a result of a change in our mix of business primarily related to medicare advantage  part d  and commercial risk 
cost of sales increased due to the growth of the pharmacy benefit management program revenues in the workers compensation division as noted above 
selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the costs associated with the growth in the medicare business including higher wage expense  an increase in broker commission costs and other member related costs due to the higher medicare membership 
additionally there was higher wage expense related to annual incentive compensation accruals in the current year  while such types of incentive payments were not earned and accrued in  new executive hires in the current year  and severance expense related to terminated employees in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue improved as a result of expenses being controlled at a rate lower than the increase in revenue 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to impairment charges to our customer list balances during interest expense decreased due to the repayment of the company s revolving credit facility and repurchase of senior notes during as well as decreased interest rates on the revolving credit facility during the current year 
other income  net increased for the current year due to a charge of million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities recorded in this other than temporary impairment loss did not reoccur in additionally  other income  net increased due to gains of million on the repurchase of outstanding senior notes during partially offsetting the increases was a million current year interest income decrease resulting from lower interest rates on the large percentage of the portfolio invested in treasury instruments and money market funds 
the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to as compared to for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with higher tax rates 
comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased as a result of growth in existing products  primarily medicare advantage and medicare part d  as well as from our acquisitions during of vista health plans vista and business from mutual of omaha mutual 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in same store commercial risk membership over the prior year 
management services revenue increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of business from concentra  inc concentra and organic growth in our workers compensation services business 
this increase was partially offset by the other national aso membership decline described above 
medical costs increased as a result of new business as discussed above 
medical costs also increased due to increased commercial and medicare pffs medical cost trends as well as unfavorable ibnr reserve development with respect to our medicare pffs business 
the medicare part d medical loss ratio increase was a result of the premium rate changes from the annual competitive bid filings for our medicare part d products and growth in our low income auto assign population in selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs associated with our prior year acquisitions of concentra  mutual and vista  as well as costs related to growth of our medicare business 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily increased as a result of the expense associated with the amortizable intangible assets identified with our recent acquisitions 
interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt during the prior year and due to interest expense incurred on the net draw down of million on the revolving credit facility in october the increase was partially offset by the redemption during the first quarter of of our million of outstanding senior notes due february  associated with this redemption  we recognized million of interest expense in the prior year first quarter for both the premium paid on redemption as well as the write off of associated deferred financing costs 
other income decreased due to a charge of million that consisted of million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities and million in realized losses on the sale of securities 
the decrease also resulted from lower interest rates during the effective tax rate on continuing operations was essentially flat at  as compared to for the prior year 
segment results from continuing operations as a result of the change in our executive leadership  we realigned our organizational structure during the first quarter of the new organizational structure brings enhanced focus to areas of growth opportunities 
accordingly  our reportable segments have changed to the following three reportable segments health plan and medical services  specialized managed care  and workers compensation 
the company s segment results for the prior years presented have been reclassified to conform to the segment presentation  including the presentation of discontinued operations 
year ended december  increase year ended december  increase continuing operations decrease decrease operating revenues in thousands commercial risk commercial management services medicare advantage medicaid risk health plan and medical services medicare part d other premiums other management services specialized managed care workers compensation other eliminations total operating revenues gross margin in thousands health plan and medical services specialized managed care workers compensation other eliminations total revenue and medical cost statistics managed care premium yields per member per month health plan commercial risk medicare advantage risk medicare part d medicaid risk medical loss ratios health plan commercial risk medicare advantage risk medicare part d medicaid risk total revenue per member per month excludes the effect of revenue ceded to external parties 
revenue per member per month excludes the effect of cms risk share premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties 
comparison of to health plan and medical services division health plan and medical services revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to membership growth in the medicare pffs products  coupled with an increase in the average realized premium yield per member per month for the product 
deducting revenue ceded to third parties  the medicare advantage risk premium yield per member per month for the year increased to in from in the increase is a result of a smaller portion of our medicare pffs business in being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements 
when reviewing the premium yield for medicare advantage business  we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements 
additionally  the medicare advantage risk premium yields have increased as a result of higher risk scores 
medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases in missouri  our largest medicaid market  effective july  and july  as well as rate increases in virginia and west virginia effective july  the yields also increased due to the termination of our pennsylvania medicaid behavioral health contract  which had a lower premium yield 
these increases in premium yield were offset by declines in the membership of the medicaid risk product 
membership declines also contributed to the reduction in revenue for commercial risk products 
gross margin increased primarily due to the growth in the medicare pffs and medicare advantage businesses as well as the improved medical loss ratios for the medicare pffs product 
the medicare pffs mlrs decreased over the prior year as the prior year included unfavorable ibnr reserve development 
the increases in gross margin were partially offset by gross margin declines in commercial risk and medicaid 
the commercial risk decline in gross margin is a result of the decline in commercial risk membership discussed earlier 
the decline in medicaid gross margin was due to a higher medical loss ratio in as a result of higher medical cost trends and higher inpatient utilization without rate increases sufficient to cover these cost increases 
specialized managed care division specialized managed care revenue experienced a significant increase over the prior year due to the large increase in membership for the medicare part d product 
medicare part d premium yields for  excluding the effect of cms risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties  decreased compared to  primarily due to the mix of products sold in the majority of the medicare part d growth was in the lower cost  leaner benefit plans  which have a lower premium 
including the effect of the cms risk sharing premium adjustments as well as the ceded revenue  the premium yields were for compared to in the increase is a result of a smaller portion of our medicare part d business in being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements 
when reviewing the premium yield for medicare part d business  we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements 
when reviewing the medicare part d business  adjusting for the risk share amounts is useful to understand the results of the part d business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue will eventually be insignificant on a full year basis 
the gross margin for the specialized managed care division improved for primarily as a result of increased part d membership during the current periods  offset by an increase in the part d mlr due to higher than anticipated pharmacy costs in one product 
workers compensation division revenue in the workers compensation division increased in primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program 
the increase was partially offset by lower revenue in the division s other business lines as a result of lower claim volume 
workers compensation gross margin decreased over the prior year due to the decline in claims volume in our bill review business  which is a higher margin product  and growth in the pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs 
premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned  and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period  typically to days after the date such medical services are rendered 
the lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth 
as a result  we typically hold approximately one to two months of float 
in addition  accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow 
due to the non renewal of our pffs product  we will be paying medical claims in without the benefit of premium collections for this product 
as a result  this will have a negative effect on cash flows 
despite this  the company has planned for this market exit and accordingly has ample current liquidity 
in addition  our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits 
our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal 
our fixed income portfolio has an average quality rating of aa and a modified duration of years as of december  typically  the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities 
our cash and investments  consisting of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations  risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business 
see part i  item a  risk factors  in this form k for more information 
management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations  cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  capital expenditures  debt interest costs  debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements 
cash flows operating activities net cash from operating activities for the year ended december   was a result of net earnings plus non cash adjustments to earnings including the impairment of fhsc goodwill and an increase in both medical liabilities and other payables 
the increase in medical liabilities during is primarily related to the growth in membership across the medicare business 
other payables increased primarily due to accruals for annual incentive compensation programs  an increase in taxes payable  and medicare payables 
our net cash from operating activities in was million higher than the primary driver of this increase was a change in other receivables related to pharmacy rebate receivable accruals and cms related receivable accruals 
also contributing to the change in cash from operating activities from compared to is the change in other payables  which was the result of incentive compensation accruals in but not in and the increase in income taxes payable and medicare payables during the increase in other receivables during and other payables during was partially offset by a decline in net earnings in compared to and a smaller increase in medical liabilities in than in investing activities capital expenditures in of approximately million consisted primarily of computer hardware  software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems 
projected capital expenditures in of approximately million consisted primarily of computer hardware  software and other equipment 
net cash from investing activities for the year ended december  was an outflow primarily due to a large amount of investment purchases during the period 
this outflow was partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of investments and also from the proceeds received from the disposal of fhsc 
additionally  escrow payments totaling million were received during the period from previous acquisitions 
during the prior year ended december   we made acquisitions using cash of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
financing activities the details of our debt repayment for are as follows we repaid a total of million principal amount of our remaining outstanding senior notes for payments of million  resulting in a gain of million  net of the write off of deferred financing costs 
we repaid million of our revolving credit facility 
our credit facility requires compliance with a leverage ratio 
all of our senior notes and credit facility contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding additional debt  dividends or other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  disposing of assets and in some cases provide for debt repayment upon consolidations or mergers 
as of december   we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the senior notes and credit facility 
our board of directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
as a part of this program  million shares were purchased in at an aggregate cost of million  million shares of our common stock were purchased in at an aggregate cost of million and million shares of our common stock were purchased in at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is million 
health plans our regulated hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities 
during  we received million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and infused million in capital contributions into our subsidiaries  due primarily to the significant growth of pffs and part d in the national association of insurance commissioners naic has proposed that states adopt risk based capital rbc standards that would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the managed care organization s rbc is calculated by applying factors to various assets  premiums and reserve items 
the factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items 
the adequacy of a managed care organization s actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its rbc as determined by the formula 
our health plans are required to submit a rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
regulators will use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions that could take place  if any  range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels  to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted rbc policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level which is currently equal to of their rbc 
the state of florida does not currently use rbc methodology in its regulation of hmos 
some states  in which our regulated subsidiaries operate  require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance 
the table below summarizes our statutory reserve information  as of december  and in millions  except percentage data 
unaudited regulated capital and surplus of rbc a  b excess capital and surplus above of rbc a  b capital and surplus as percentage of rbc a  b statutory deposits a unaudited b as mentioned above  the state of florida does not have a rbc requirement for its regulated hmos 
accordingly  the statutory reserve information provided for vista is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the state of florida 
the increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company  partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company 
we believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments  we had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase resulted from the proceeds received from the disposal of fhsc  earnings from non regulated businesses  and dividends from our regulated subsidiaries 
these were partially offset by capital infusions into our subsidiaries  payments made for share repurchases  and debt repayments 
other as of december   we were contractually obligated to make the following payments during the next five years and thereafter in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years senior notes interest payable on senior notes credit facilities interest payable on credit facilities a operating leases total contractual obligations less sublease income net contractual obligations a interest payable on credit facilities has been estimated based on interest rates as of february and assumes no additional changes in the principal amount 
refer to note l  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our operating leases 
we have typically paid to of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred 
accordingly  we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments 
other disclosures legislation and regulation as a managed health care company  we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services 
the laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory  regulatory and administrative powers 
these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans 
managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented 
likewise  interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change 
although the provisions of any future legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term 
nevertheless  it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations 
see government regulation under part i  item for additional discussion of government regulation that impacts our businesses 
inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations  in which we assume underwriting risk  we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective 
outlook health plan and medical services division we expect our commercial group risk membership will be down for the year in the low to mid single digit range  excluding the addition of the announced acquisition of preferred health systems phs on february  and its commercial risk membership of approximately  members 
for same store commercial membership  the forecasted health plan mlr is expected to be in the range of to  compared to for including the effect of the phs acquisition  we expect the total commercial group mlr to be in a range of to 
overall  we expect the acquisition of phs to be neutral to earnings for the year 
as previously announced  we have decided not to renew our national pffs product for the plan year 
there will be a claims run out period for this product in  which we believe has been adequately reserved for as of the year end 
for our health plan based medicare advantage product  we currently are forecasting membership to remain approximately flat for against results 
we expect the medicare advantage mlr to be in the mid s 
specialized managed care division after our significant membership growth in  we expect our medicare part d product to be down slightly to approximately million members for this slight decrease reflects the loss of some auto assign regions along with some state pharmacy assistance program members 
our mlr expectation for will be similar to our actual results in  which was in the mid s 
workers compensation division we believe our workers compensation division will remain stable compared to  with continued focus on the supporting administrative cost structure 
regarding our balance sheet and liquidity  we ended the year with approximately million in free cash at the parent level  and approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and us treasury securities on a consolidated basis 
after a million payment during the fourth quarter in  we have a net balance owing on our revolving line of credit of million 
as usual  our first priority with our free cash will be to support the regulatory capital needs of our subsidiaries  and to maintain liquidity 
regarding our effective tax rate  we expect it will range from to for the full year of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under an investment policy approved by our board of directors  we invest primarily in marketable us government and agency  state  municipal  mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
our investment policy and guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade 
our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and if  in our best interest  such investments were not disposed within days after acquisition 
as described in the notes to the financial statements  we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of first health and in an insurance agency through our acquisition of vista 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
we are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolio s duration and mix of securities 
we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration  federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or geographic area  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
when we determine that a decline in fair value below amortized cost is judged to be other than temporary we are required to recognize the credit loss component as a charge in net earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
see note g  investments  to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments
