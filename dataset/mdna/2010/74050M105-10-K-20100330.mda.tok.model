the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of premier in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the audit committee of the board of directors engaged crowe horwath llp crowe as independent auditors to audit the consolidated financial statements  and their report is included elsewhere herein 
financial information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is designed to assist readers of the consolidated financial statements in understanding significant changes in premier s financial condition and results of operations 
management s objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls 
the financial control system of premier is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the financial records 
as an integral part of that financial control system  the holding company employs a staff of internal auditors and contracts with professional accounting firms to perform internal audits of the financial records of each of the subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
the internal audit manager reports the findings and recommendations highlighted by the internal audits to premier s audit committee as well 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  as the audit committees of the subsidiaries 
also  on a regular periodic basis  the subsidiary banks are examined by federal and state banking authorities for safety and soundness as well as compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations 
the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the 
consolidated financial statements  accompanying 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and 
management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

management s discussion and analysis december  allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment using accounting guidance issued by financial accounting standards board fasb 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by accounting guidance 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not

management s discussion and analysis december  adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions and impairment of goodwill for acquisitions  premier is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
the loans acquired via the purchase of abigail adams were recorded on the books of premier at their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded by premier at the date of acquisition 
however  in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail due to uncertainties in the economy  the borrower s ability to repay or other factors  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
under accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis

management s discussion and analysis december  summary financial results premier had net income available to common shareholders of million in compared to million of net income reported for the year and reported for net income increased in largely due to acquisition activity in and in  higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense were partially offset by higher non interest expense 
the increases in each of these categories was primarily the result of the increase in operations from the acquisitions of abigail adams on october   and citizens first and traders  both of which occurred at the close of business on april  the operating results of abigail adams  citizens first and traders are included in the consolidated financial statements of premier only from the date of their respective acquisition 
when comparing operating results to operating results  the operations of abigail adams are included only for the last three months of and none at all in similarly  the operations of citizens first and traders are included for the full twelve months of but only for the last eight months of the increase in net income available to shareholders over was again a result of higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense all of which was partially offset by higher non interest expense 
these results were largely due to the acquisitions of citizens first and traders 
when comparing operating results to operating results  the operations of citizens first and traders are included only for the last eight months of and none at all in basic earnings per share were in compared to in and to in the increase in earnings per share in resulted from a proportionately greater increase in net income available to common shareholders from the acquisition of abigail adams versus the increase in average shares outstanding issued to acquire the entity 
the decrease in earnings per share in resulted from the increase in the average shares outstanding related to the common stock issued as part of the merger consideration of citizens first and traders 
the terms of the acquisitions are more fully described in

the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years

it also facilitates the analysis of earnings performance of different sized organizations 
in  and  premier increased the size its balance sheet from million in total assets at the end of to million at the end of to  million at the end of largely due to acquisitions 
the increase in asset size will generally result in higher dollars of income earned and expenses incurred 
a detailed review of the components of roa will help analyze premier s performance without regard to changes in its size 
premier s net income in resulted in an roa of  a decrease from the roa in and the in as shown in the table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earnings assets reached its highest level during the last five years in at

in  net credit income was of average earning assets and increased to its highest level in the last five years in in  minimal provisions for loan losses were recorded and thus there was little reduction from net interest income 
in  negative provisions for loan losses were recorded which served to help increase net credit income to 
this increase in net credit income as a percent of average earning assets was complemented by an increase in non interest income as a percent of average earning assets and a reduction in non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets when compared to the previous year 
in  while net interest income increased to its highest level  net credit income was lower than as a result of minimal negative provisions for loan losses recorded in however  in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets also reached its highest level in the past five years while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets continued to decline 
in  minimal provisions for loan losses reduced an already lower net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  resulting in net credit income of of average earning assets 
in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets declined somewhat  returning to the level achieved in however  non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets continued to decline in resulting in the lowest ratio over in the last five years 
in  net credit income as a percent of average earning assets declined to  the lowest level in the last five years  as the lower net interest income described above was lowered even further by the highest provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets over the past five year period 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was the lowest non interest income and highest non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets in the last five years largely due to acquisition related expenses  a special fdic insurance assessment  write downs on the value of other real estate owned oreo and lower deposit customer fee income in relation to the total deposits outstanding 
adding to premier s return on average assets in was a gain recognized on the acquisition of abigail adams and lower income tax expense 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier s return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to

this ratio compares to in  in  the lowest ratio reported in the last five years  in and in the increases in net overhead was largely the result of a higher ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to acquisition related expenses  significantly higher fdic insurance costs  higher oreo costs and generally less efficient operations of the acquired abigail adams subsidiary banks 
also negatively affecting the net overhead ratio was a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets largely due to the non interest income ratio of the acquired abigail adams banks and a slight decrease in secondary market mortgage commissions despite the increase in the size of the company 
the increase in net overhead when compared to was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets due to lower secondary market mortgage commissions overall and the non interest income ratio of the acquired banks 
the decrease in the net overhead ratio when compared to was the result of increases in premier s non interest income related to electronic banking income and secondary market mortgage commissions  plus decreases in non interest expenses related to staff costs and the accelerated amortization of trust preferred issuance costs recorded in but not

in  premier realized a million or increase in average outstanding loans in its ohio markets  and a million or increase in its west virginia market excluding traders and citizens first 
these increases more than offset the slight  or decrease in average total loans in premier s kentucky markets 
total loans at december  increased by million or from the total at december  this increase follows a million or from the total at december  the significant increase in is due to the million of period end loans from the acquisition of abigail adams 
the remaining banks collectively had a million or decrease in their total period end loans as increases in total loans at the west virginia and ohio banks were more than offset by decreases at the kentucky banks 
the significant increase in is primarily due to the million of period end loans from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million or increase in was the result of significant increase in loan demand in premier s markets 
loans secured by real estate in total increased from of premier s loan portfolio at december  to approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december  due to the loans acquired from abigail adams 
the mix of loans acquired from abigail adams was significantly different from premier s other affiliate bank loan portfolios  which consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
the december  balances of the loans acquired from adams national were predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans  including million of loans secured by non owner occupied commercial property  million of loans secured by owner occupied commercial property  million of multi family residential real estate loans and million of commercial real estate construction and land development loans 
the concentrations in these kinds of loans was one of the factors motivating the occ to require adams national to enter into a formal written agreement to reduce these concentrations 
the mix of december  balances of the loans acquired from cb t were closer to the ratios of 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  premier s other affiliate banks but were still predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans due in part to loan participations with adams national 
while there are generally additional risks of loss associated with commercial real estate lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions  the borrowers inability to successfully execute their business plan and or deterioration in the value of the commercial real estate collateral  the loans acquired from adams national and cb t were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date taking into account credit risks in the loans acquired 
see additional discussion below on the impaired loans acquired from adams national and cb t 
premier s residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses an experienced staff underwriter to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets at year end these amounts compare to million of total non performing assets or of total assets at year end and million of total non performing assets or of total assets at year end  the lowest levels over the past five years 
the significant increase in from year end is largely due to the non performing assets that came with the acquisition of abigail adams and its two subsidiary banks 
at december   these two banks accounted for million or of premier s non performing assets 
however  since these assets were recorded at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition  the amount of credit risk assumed by premier is not nearly as great as the volume of non performing assets suggests taken at face value 
the estimate of fair value on all loans  but particularly on non performing assets  included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates included significant discounts on the non accrual loans 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
under previous accounting standards  the loan loss allowance of acquired banks would have carried over to premier s books and records  as was the case for traders and citizens first 
the following table illustrates the december  face value of the non performing assets of the two subsidiary banks from the acquisition of abigail adams and the discounted net carrying value of those non performing assets 
non performing assets at acquired subsidiary banks dollars in thousands december  face value discounted net carrying value non performing assets non accrual loans loans days past due other real estate owned total non performing assets face value includes reductions for interest payments received on loans while on non accrual status in accordance with the cost recovery method of accounting for non accrual loans 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is largely due to a million increase in restructured loans 
these loans were performing in accordance with their modified terms at december   but because the loan terms were modified to assist the borrower to repay the loan  the loans are included with total non performing assets 
most of premier s restructured loans are loans that have been modified to allow the borrower to pay interest only for a limited amount of time 
also included in the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is a  increase in non accrual loans offset by a  decrease in loans days past due and a  decrease in other real estate owned oreo 
the increase in total non performing assets in was largely due to the million of non performing assets at december  at the acquired traders bank 
in addition to the non accrual loans at traders bank  in a million increase in non accrual loans was largely offset by decreases in loans past due days or more and restructured loans 
while the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at the end of was higher than the end of  it was still lower than either of the previous two years presented in the table above 
the decrease in total non performing assets in was largely due a million decrease in non accrual loans and a continued decrease in oreo property 
these decreases offset the increase in restructured loans  while loans past due days or more and still accruing remained virtually unchanged 
in  the level of non accrual loans declined primarily as a result of loan payoffs as well as partial or complete loan charge offs 
management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these non performing assets were included in the analyses that supported the recording of provisions for loan loss during and as management s efforts to collect on all of the company s non performing assets continue  matured loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
as previously demonstrated by premier s history  management is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in non accrual loans and loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million 
this experience and performance in pursuing the collection of non performing assets was a factor in management s decision to pursue the acquisition of abigail adams and its high level of non performing assets 
while the circumstances related to the collection of every non performing loan is different  with the benefit of the additional capital provided by premier s participation in the tarp capital purchase program and the requirement to record the non performing assets at their estimated fair value at acquisition date  management believes it will be successful in resolving a majority of the non performing assets acquired from abigail adams 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
through its acquisition of abigail adams  premier now has million of construction loans on non accrual status at december  whereby additional funds may be needed by the borrower to complete the project 
for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during  premier recorded  of writedowns and losses on the disposition of oreo properties  net of gains  compared to  of such writedowns and losses in in premier recognized a  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties 
the significant increase in oreo writedowns and losses in primarily relates to properties held at the newly acquired traders bank 
carrying values of oreo properties were compared to updated appraisals and additional writedowns of the property value were charged directly to operations based upon the updated net realizable value 
the properties were primarily undeveloped vacant land

the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
in  premier recorded  of additional provisions for loan losses  while in  premier recorded  of additional provisions for loan losses 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
all of these events occurred in varying degrees during and resulted in  of negative provisions during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the significant decrease in the ratio of allowance to total loans was directly the result of adding the million of loans from the acquisition of abigail adams without adding any allowance for loan losses 
new accounting guidance adopted by premier at the beginning of does not permit an acquirer to carryover the purchased entity s allowance for loan losses 
instead  under the new accounting guidance  all acquired loans are to be recorded at their net estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
however  since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
at september   just prior to premier s acquisition  abigail adams reported a collective allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
in contrast  premier recorded the estimated fair value of the combined loan portfolios at an estimated million discount to the contractual amounts receivable on the loans at acquisition 
these discounts  allocated per loan  will be used to offset any charge offs of the uncollectible portion of the contractual amount due on non performing assets  or accreted into interest income using a level yield method on performing loans 
should premier collect the full contractual amount due  any fair value discount would be recognized as interest income 
excluding the loans acquired from abigail adams  the remaining allowance for loan losses was of total year end loans 
the decrease in the ratio is largely due to the charge off of loans to one borrower that had been identified and carried as an impaired loan for more than three years 
premier finally received permission from the bankruptcy court to foreclose upon and liquidate the collateral 
the actual charge off was approximately the amount of allowance allocated to the loan during its classification as an impaired loan 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the million of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the million of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans 
while the total allowance increased by million from the million allowance at the end of  the ratio to total loans decreased slightly from the of total year end loans at december  the increase in the allowance in is largely due to the million allowance for loan losses acquired via the purchase of traders and citizens first banks  as permitted by the accounting guidance in place in the slight decrease in the ratio to total year end loans is largely the result of lower estimates of required allocations of the allowance to impaired loans due to a combination of collections of previously impaired loans and improved loan to collateral values on existing impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the  of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the  of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
the decrease in the allowance in compared to was primarily the result of the  of negative provisions for loan losses coupled with  of net charge offs recorded during the year 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a more detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
in  due to the deterioration in the national economy and its impact on the local economy in its markets  premier experienced increases in past due loans and non performing assets 
as such  management s estimate of the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio began to increase in the second quarter of and provisions for loan losses were charged to earnings in the second  third and fourth quarters which more than

management s discussion and analysis december  in  provisions for loan losses totaled million compared to  of provision expense in in  a negative provision was recorded during the second quarter which exceeded the quarterly provisions recorded during the other three quarters of the year 
the negative provision was recorded primarily as result of realized collections of previously impaired loans whereby estimated losses were not realized as previously estimated and assigned to the loan 
in addition  premier has been successful in recovering some of its previously charged off loans 
these positive events as well as the ongoing reduction in premier s historical loss ratios resulted in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio during the second quarter of  and a negative provision was warranted 
the negative provision for loan losses totaled  in future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  in the level of charge offs of commercial loans and loans secured by real estate 
although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets 
furthermore  any resulting increases in loans placed on non accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income 
also  as these plans are executed  other loans may be identified that would necessitate additional charge offs and potentially additional provisions for loan losses 
premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market price declines may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while some price deterioration is expected  it is not currently anticipated that premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the company s markets in west virginia  ohio and kentucky 
with the concentrations of commercial real estate loans acquired in the washington  dc and richmond  virginia markets  fluctuations in commercial real estate value will also be monitored 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the significant increase in is largely due to the million of average investment securities from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million or increase is largely due the declining interest rate environment during the year 
as rates began falling  investable funds held in federal funds sold were used to purchase high quality investment securities to achieve a greater yield over a longer period of maturity 
yields on federal funds sold rise and fall in direct correlation with interest rate changes made by the federal reserve board in establishing national economic policy 
investment security yields are based on a number of pricing factors including but not limited to coupon rate  time to maturity and issuer credit quality 
generally  in investment security yields were higher than the yield that could be earned on federal funds sold

in  premier s federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances averaged million  a increase from the million averaged in the increase in average federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances in was largely due to the acquisitions of traders and citizens first which added million in average balances during the year 
this increase more than offset the million or decrease in average federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances of premier s other affiliate banks

most customers are still keeping their maturity choices short in order to take advantage of possible higher interest rates in the future 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates in to remain competitive  premier continued to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers 
in order to help maintain their liquidity and reduce their reliance on short term borrowings  prior to their acquisition by premier the two subsidiary banks of abigail adams participated in a network of approved banks that exchange customer certificates of deposit called the certificate of deposit account registry service program  also known as cdars 
this program allows local customers to open certificates of deposit in amounts greater than the standard fdic insurance coverage limits at their local bank and still maintain fdic insurance coverage on the deposits as the local bank enters the certificates of deposit into a national exchange network which provides fdic insurance coverage by opening accounts in the customer s name at other participating banks in the network in increments less than the standard fdic coverage limits 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds  and a sophisticated matching system enables network members to exchange funds with each other on a dollar for dollar basis 
to participate in the program  banks subject to a written agreement with their primary regulator  such as adams national  are required to get permission from the fdic 
while adams national was a participant in the network and currently has deposits from the cdars network  the bank has been denied permission by the fdic to continue to open new or renew existing cdars deposits while it is subject to its written agreement with the occ  its primary regulator 
as the cdars deposits mature  local customers may or may not renew their certificates of deposit with adams national 
under long existing fdic rules for banks owned by the same holding company under common control  such as each of premier s affiliate banks  each bank under common control is obligated to guarantee the liquidity of deposit funds over and above the fdic coverage limits at each of the other banks under the same common control 
in other words  each of premier s affiliate banks are obligated to provide liquidity for each of the other premier affiliate banks to the extent it may be needed for deposit withdrawals 
premier believes that knowledge of this guarantee may result in some of the maturing cdars related deposits at adams national to renew their certificate of deposit outside of the cdars program until adams national once again obtains permission to actively participate in the cdars network

management s discussion and analysis december  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points  but never below zero 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

base rate liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in as illustrated in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the decrease in cash from operations was primarily the result of non cash generating income from the gain on the acquisition of subsidiary and changes in other assets and liabilities 
the increase in over was primarily the result of an increase in net income and a higher amount of cash received from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
total cash from operations along with proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities and the repayment of loans were used to purchase securities  satisfy deposit withdrawals  fund new loans and reduce outstanding debt during those years 
in  million of cash was used in investing activities  to fund loan growth but to also increase federal funds sold 
in  million of cash was used in investing activities  again funding loan growth  and purchasing the traders and citizens first subsidiaries 
in  million of additional cash was generated from investing activities largely from the cash acquired via the acquisition of abigail adams and the net repayment of loans during the year 
in addition to the million of cash from operations in  premier generated million in additional cash from financing activities  primarily due the net increase in deposits  the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program and from additional borrowings 
some of these funds were used to repay short and long term borrowings  pay dividends to shareholders  and satisfy withdrawals of repurchase agreements with customers

details on the sources and uses of cash can be found in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the parent company had million in cash held with its subsidiary banks 
this balance  along with cash dividends expected to be received from its subsidiaries  is sufficient to cover the operating costs of the parent  service its existing debt and pay dividends to common and preferred shareholders 
during  the parent company generated million of cash from operations and borrowed an additional million 
the parent company also generated million by selling its series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
the proceeds were used to make additional capital investments in premier s subsidiaries to strengthen the subsidiary s balance sheet and capital ratios and or reduce the subsidiary s debt 
operating cash was also used to pay million in dividends to shareholders and to make million in principal payments on its outstanding debt 
during  the parent company generated million of cash from operations and borrowed an additional million 
the proceeds were used to fund the million of cash paid to acquire citizens first and traders  to make million in principal payments on its outstanding debt and pay million in dividends to shareholders

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  up from in and in the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the increase in was largely due to the additional equity added from the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
without this additional equity  premier s average equity to asset ratio would have still have been  down from prior years due to the acquisition of abigail adams  but strengthened by additional capital from the million retained net income generated in also adding to capital in was a general rise in the market value of investments from a million net unrealized gain at the end of to a million net unrealized gain at the end of the increase in was largely due to the increase in equity from net income plus a general rise in the market value of investments from a  net unrealized gain at the end of to a million net unrealized gain at the end of also supporting the average equity to assets ratio were the combined acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the equity issued to acquire these two banks amounted to of the total assets acquired  which approximates premier s average equity to asset ratio over the past three years

management s discussion and analysis december  the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was  compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets  net of any related deferred taxes as permitted 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was  compared to at december  both of these ratios are above the to ratios recommended by the federal reserve 
the increase in the leverage ratio was largely the result of the additional regulatory capital obtained via the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
the decrease in the risk adjusted capital to assets ratio is largely the result of a higher level of risk adjusted assets to total assets acquired from abigail adams versus premier s historical risk adjusted assets to total assets 
the decrease in the ratios from the prior year was primarily the result of the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
their individual bank risk adjusted capital to asset ratios and leverage ratios were lower than premier s prior to the acquisition date 
furthermore  the goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded as part of the purchases  net of any related deferred taxes as permitted  are subtracted from premier s total capital to calculate these ratios 
premier s capital ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position

management s discussion and analysis december  the primary source of funds for dividends paid by premier is the dividends received from its subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions more fully described in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  premier s banks could  without prior approval  declare and pay to premier dividends of approximately million plus any net profits retained through the date of declaration by ohio river bank  boone county bank  first central bank  consolidated bank trust and citizens deposit bank 
in  farmers deposit bank requested and received approval from its primary regulators to pay a million dividend in march this amount was substantially higher than the bank s prior two years of reported net income 
as such  farmers deposit bank must continue to request approval for up to two years beyond march  to pay any future dividends to the parent company out of its current earnings 
similarly  traders will be required to request approval to pay any dividends for up to two years depending upon its future net income performance 
adams national is required to obtain regulatory approval to pay dividends to premier as part of its written agreement with the occ 
pursuant to the terms of premier s participation in the tarp capital purchase program  premier s ability to declare or pay dividends on any of its common shares is limited 
specifically  premier is unable to declare dividend payments on common shares if we are in arrears on the payment of dividends on the series a preferred shares 
further  premier is not permitted to increase dividends on its common shares above the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  per share without the us treasury s approval until october   unless all of the series a preferred shares have been redeemed or transferred by the us treasury to unaffiliated third parties

management s discussion and analysis december  non interest income and expense non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving profitability 
recognizing this importance  management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced 
as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income increased by  or in the increase in was largely due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts and electronic banking income resulting from the acquisition of abigail adams and the inclusion of traders and citizens first for an additional first four months in versus only the eight months since their april  acquisition 
in  service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or to  approximately  of this increase was the result of adding the operations of abigail adams while another  was added from the inclusion of traders and citizens first for an additional four months in the remaining  or decrease at the remaining affiliate banks was largely due to customers lower propensity to overdraft their deposit accounts 
management believes that the downturn in the economy has caused customers to more closely manage their deposit funds to find ways to save money and thus reduce their number of overdrafts 
electronic banking income  which consists of debit and credit card transaction fees  atm fees and internet banking fees  increased  or to  in approximately  of this increase was the result of adding the operations of abigail adams while another  was added from the inclusion of traders and citizens first for an additional four months in the remaining  or increase is due to an increasing number of customers who conduct their banking and purchasing electronically  primarily via the use of debit and atm cards 
in  secondary market mortgage income commissions and fees earned from originating and selling mortgage loans to third parties in the secondary market decreased by  or to  the acquisitions of abigail adams  traders and citizens first added virtually no revenue of this type in the decrease in secondary market mortgage income in reflects an industry in extreme change through out the year 
many mortgage loan purchasers ceased buying new mortgages in or went out of business completely 
premier concentrates its efforts on selling high quality mortgage loans and routinely searches for new buyers for these loans  however  the volume of future sales may depend on factors beyond the control of the company 
the federal government  via government sponsored agencies  began buying the surplus in available secondary market mortgages but significantly increased the required documentation from the home buyers  thus complicating the process in comparison to years past 
the perceived difficultly from the home buyer s perspective had a negative impact on premier s secondary market business during other non interest income decreased by  or  in the operations of abigail adams added approximately  of other non interest income  while another  was added from the inclusion of traders and citizens first for an additional four months in the remaining  decrease is largely due to  of income received in for extending premier s atm processing contract and lower sources of other income  such as commissions on selling credit life insurance  check cashing fees and extension and other miscellaneous loan fees

the remaining  or increase was largely due to incremental increases in fee rates and growth in the number of deposit customers 
electronic banking income increased  or to  in approximately  of this increase was the result of adding the operations of traders and citizens first 
the remaining  or increase was largely due to premier s conversion to a more modern banking software system in this banking software system has allowed premier to offer more electronic banking services and made it easier for customers to conduct their banking electronically 
in  secondary market mortgage income decreased by  or to  traders and citizens first had virtually no revenue of this type in the decrease in secondary market mortgage income in is primarily due to a significant decrease in the appetite of secondary market mortgage loan purchasers as brokers have either tightened their credit standards or have ceased buying new mortgages in an effort to avoid further exposure to sub prime lending 
premier concentrates its efforts on selling high quality mortgage loans  but still experienced some of the negative effects from the decrease in the interest in buying mortgages as an investment 
other non interest income increased by  or  in included in this increase is  of other non interest income from the operations of traders and citizens first

in  premier realized  in gains on the sale of investment securities 
in and  premier did not execute any sales of investment securities 
in  premier recorded a  gain on the acquisition of abigail adams 
new accounting guidance adopted by premier at the beginning of  changed the way negative goodwill is calculated and recorded on the books of an acquiring organization 
prior to  negative goodwill resulted when the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price paid for a subsidiary 
this negative goodwill was recorded on the balance sheet and accreted into income over a designated period of time 
under current accounting guidance  negative goodwill is no longer recorded on the balance sheet and any negative difference in fair value of the net assets acquired versus the purchase price paid for those net assets is immediately recognized in non interest income 
also  prior to  the purchase price paid for a subsidiary involving an exchange of the company s stock was determined using the company s stock price on the day prior to public announcement of the acquisition agreement 
under current accounting guidance  the purchase price paid is determined using the stock price on the day prior to the effective date of the acquisition 
since the consideration paid by premier to the shareholders of abigail adams was a fixed exchange ratio of its common stock  several factors contributed to premier realizing a gain on the acquisition  including but not limited to a decrease in the calculation of the purchase price paid by premier due to a decline in premier s stock price from the date the fixed exchange ratio was agreed upon to the day before the effective date of the

effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
