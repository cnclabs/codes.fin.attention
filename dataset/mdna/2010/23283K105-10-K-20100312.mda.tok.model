overview cytori therapeutics  inc manufactures  develops  and commercializes innovative medical technologies that allow physicians to practice regenerative medicine 
the company has two main product lines the celution family  which includes the first and only broadly available device that provides clinical grade autologous stem and regenerative cells at the point of care and the stemsource family for use in laboratory research and stem cell banking 
cytori s core technology extracts and concentrates a patient s own stem and regenerative cells at the bedside so their cells may be redelivered during the same surgical procedure 
our commercialization model is based on the sale of the celution system and the generation of recurring revenue thereafter from the sale of single use consumables used in every patient procedure  as well as sales of related instrumentation and ancillary products 
cytori s near term strategy is to focus on development and sales in the cosmetic and reconstructive surgery crs market and the cell banking market  which we believe can be successfully penetrated more quickly than our other target markets 
we are simultaneously developing our celution system for cardiovascular application which we believe will require a greater investment in time and money to bring to market 
another important component of our commercialization strategy is for cytori to enable physicians and researchers around the world to identify and develop new applications for our technology  in addition to our current clinical trials for breast reconstruction and cardiovascular disease  including stress urinary incontinence  wound healing  burns  liver disease  renal failure  pelvic health conditions and gas trointestinal disorders 
the more therapeutic applications that are developed for the celution system and its cellular output  the more opportunities we will have to offer the celution system and related consumable sets to hospitals  clinics  and physicians 
in europe  our commercial activities are focused on market specific development and marketing the celution system family of products for use in cosmetic and augmentation procedures  as well as soft tissue reconstructive procedures 
in  we broadened our commercialization efforts  with an increased emphasis on direct sales 
these efforts included bringing on additional sales  technical and customer support personnel to our eu based sales team  launching an educational campaign directed at patients  and developing additional products for use in the crs market 
our education campaign is designed to raise awareness and educate patients about cosmetic and reconstructive applications for fat grafts that have been enriched with adipose derived stem and regenerative cells 
in our goal is to help our customers to build their own celution based practices and raise awareness among their patient base for cell enriched procedures through various means  including educational campaigns 
to further support broad adoption and reimbursement for celution based cosmetic and reconstructive procedures in europe  cytori has invested in restore  a patient post marketing breast reconstruction study 
enrollment in restore  which was initiated in  was completed in november the goal of the study was to expand cosmetic and reconstructive surgery claims and seek reimbursement for the use of the celution system in post partial mastectomy defect reconstruction 
final results from this study are expected to be reported in the first half of in the united states  we are currently focused on establishing an autologous fat grafting business  starting with the sale of the puregraft pure system and the celbrush 
the puregraft pure system is designed to facilitate and streamline the fat graft preparation process  washing and filtering the tissue to remove contaminants 
in january  we received k clearance from the fda for our puregraft pure system which gives us the freedom to market the puregraft product line in the united states 
we expect to formally launch the product at the meeting of the american society of aesthetic plastic surgery in april we have also applied for market clearance in the eu which we anticipate in the celbrush is precision micro droplet delivery tool that is designed to complement o ur other cosmetic and reconstructive products 
we are continuing to seek regulatory and marketing approval of the celution system family of products in the united states 
in july  we learned that the celution system will be regulated in the united states by the fda as a medical device 
subsequently  we filed a k marketing application for use in aesthetic body contouring and or filling of soft tissue voids with the fda in november our application was reviewed by the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research under the law applicable to medical devices 
in february  we were informed by the fda that we will be required to seek approval for the celution system for use in aesthetic body contouring and filling of soft tissue defect voids through the pre market approval application pma process 
we are now w orking to determine the necessary size and scope of clinical studies to obtain this approval of celution 
we are simultaneously developing the cardiovascular application for the celution system 
cardiovascular disease  which represents a longer term investment for cytori with potentially greater revenue return  is the currently the most advanced application in our pipeline 
we have invested in two european safety and feasibility clinical trials  one for acute heart attack the apollo study and the other for chronic ischemia the precise study 
enrollment in both studies was completed in pending the report of month primary outcomes of both studies  we intend to pursue a pivotal trial  either independently or with a co development partner 
our stemsource cell banking business will contribute to product sales in  but we expect sales to further ramp once a greater number of therapeutic applications are available 
we believe that an increasing number of cell bank orders will be from cosmetic and reconstructive surgery clinics in regions outside the us where physicians are already using stem and regenerative cells  as such clinics are ideally suited to integrate cell banking into their business practice 
the stemsource mb  is marketed as a standalone piece of laboratory research equipment and serves as the foundation of the stemsource cell bank  both of which are offered worldwide to hospitals  tissue banks and other research centers so they can develop new uses for adrc s  and in turn offer patients the opportunity to cryopreserve their own a dipose derived stem and regenerative cells 
the stemsource cell bank  is being offered directly by cytori  and through our commercialization partners including green hospital supply in japan  korea  taiwan and thailand  and by ge healthcare in the united states and select european countries 
we expect that growth in the cell bank business in within asia pacific will be driven in part by hospitals where a device is already installed as part of an investigator initiated study  and where physicians are already familiar with the use of the system and its benefits 
once installed  commercialization activities are performed predominantly by our customers  however we continue to serve in a consulting capacity to assist as needed in sales and service 
coinciding with our increased investment in commercial activities  we significantly reduced preclinical research and development expenses in because we have passed the feasibility stage and are now manufacturing commercial products  we have less reliance going forward on basic and preclinical development activities 
preclinical research will continue at a base level required to fulfill demands for potential partnerships  expanding intellectual property  and supporting commercial activities 
our strategy for the future  in this current financial environment with a new product that has multiple potential applications  is to focus the majority of our financial resources on activities that will promote immediate sales of the celution  stemsource  and puregraft products  through investment in sales and mark eting activities 
cytori can effectively manage our investment in these initiatives with our current cash position  but to broaden investment in our pipeline activities would require additional funds 
cytori s business objectives for and beyond include the following achieve revenue growth in celution  stemsource and puregraft sales over expand commercial activities  including direct sales for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery in europe and asia pacific and related sales impact expand us sales in research and banking expand celution system product claims to include general and plastic surgery procedures in the eu expand celution system reimbursement in europe report month primary outcomes for cardiovascular studies precise apollo in the first half of report full month data restore in early finalize us clinical development and regulatory strategy and initiate any required clinical activities continue to manage operating expenses and cash position at optimal levels olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements jv agreements with olympus corporation olympus 
as part of the terms of the jv agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc the joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system platform 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system platform in januar y  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
put calls and guarantees the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to cytori at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
as of december   the fair value of the put was  fluctuations in the estimated put value are recorded in the statements of operations as a component of change in fair value of option liabilities 
the estimated fair value of the put has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance sheet in the caption option liability 
the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put and mark it to market each quarter until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
the joint venture currently has exclusive access to our celution system device technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of such systems to us 
once a second generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture will exclusively supply us with these systems at a formula based transfer price 
we have retained all marketing rights subject to our various distribution agreements to sell the celution system devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
we have worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design the future generations of the celution system so that it will contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
in august  we entered into a license and royalty agreement with the joint venture which provides us the ability to commercially launch the celution system platform earlier than we could have otherwise done so under the terms of the joint venture agreements 
the royalty agreement allows us to manufacture the cytori developed celution system platform  including the celution crs  until such time as the joint venture s products are commercially available for the same market served by the cytori platform  subject to a reasonable royalty that will be payabl e to the joint venture for all such sales 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
other related party transactions in a separate agreement entered into on february   we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred revenues  related party balance for the same amount 
on february   we agreed to sell  shares of unregistered common stock to green hospital supply  inc for  cash  or per share  in a private stock placement 
on february   we closed the first half of the private placement with green hospital supply  inc and received  we closed the second half of the private placement on april  and received the second payment of in august  we received an additional  from olympus in a private placement of  unregistered shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an original exercise price of per share 
the purchase price was per unit with each unit consisting of one share and warrant coverage 
the warrant is exercisable anytime after february  and will expire on august  macropore biosurgery spine and orthopedic products by selling substantially all of our spine and orthopedic surgical implant business to kensey nash corporation in the second quarter of  we have completed our transition away from the bioresorbable product line for which we were originally founded 
thin film japan distribution agreement in  we sold the majority of our thin film business to mast biosurgery ag 
we retained all rights to thin film business in japan subject to a purchase option of mast  which expired in may  and we received back from mast a license of all rights to thin film technologies in the spinal field  exclusive at least until  and the field of regenerative medicine  non exclusive on a perpetual basis 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a distribution agreement with senko medical trading company 
under this agreement  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
specifically  the license covers thin film products with the following indications anti adhesion  soft tissue support  and minimization of the attachment of soft tissues 
the distribution agreement with senko commences upon commercialization 
commercialization will occur when one or more thin film product registrations are completed with the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare  or mhlw 
following commercialization  the distribution agreement has a duration of five years and is renewable for an additional five years after reaching m utually agreed minimum purchase guarantees 
we received a  upfront license fee from senko 
we have recorded the  received as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
under the distribution agreement  we will also be entitled to earn additional payments from senko based on achieving defined milestones 
on september   we notified senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product 
as a result  we became entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  which we received in october and recorded as a component of deferred revenues 
we did not recognize any development revenues with respect to senko during each of the years ended december  and to date we have recognized a total of  in development revenues  of which were recognized and  were recognized prior to related to this agreement

assuming all other applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for product sales to customers who arrange for and manage all aspects of the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
for product sales that include a combination of equipment  services  or other multiple deliverables that will be provided in the future  we defer an estimate of the fair v alue of those future deliverables from product revenue until such deliverables have been provided or earned 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
spine and orthopedic product revenues represent sales of bioresorbable implants used in spine and orthopedic surgical procedures 
we sold substantially all of this line of business to kensey nash in may the future we expect to continue to generate regenerative cell technology product revenues during from celution crs and consumable sales in europe and we expect to generate product revenues from stemsource cell bank sales in japan through direct sales and through our distribution partner green hospital supply  as well as stemsource banking and research products in us through direct sales and through our distribution partner ge healthcare 
additionally  we expect to have product revenues related to our macropore biosurgery segment again when commercialization of the thin film products in japan occurs and we begin thin film shipments to senko  pending regulatory approval

during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangement with olympus as a result of achieving three clinical milestones during the year 
the clinical milestones reflect the achievement of the primary goals of safety and feasibility  the completion of the enrollment process for both of our clinical cardiac trials  and completion of a monitoring end point for one cardiac trial 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrang ements with olympus as a result of completing two study milestones 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study milestone and a development milestone 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of other development revenue that relates to the agreement we entered into on february   in which we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred  related party balance for the same amount 
the research grant revenue related to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimbursed us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we were required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate p rotocols established by the nih 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in qualified expenditures 
we recognized a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
macropore biosurgery thin film under a distribution agreement with senko we are entitled to earn payments based on achieving the following defined milestones upon notifying senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product  we were entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  we so notified senko on september   received payment in october of  and recorded deferred revenues of  to date  we have recognized development revenues of  in addition  we also received a  license fee that was recorded as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
because the  in license fees is potentially refundable  such amounts will not be recognized as revenues until the refund rights expire 
specifically  half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
we are also entitled to a non refundable payment of  once we achieve commercialization 
the future we may recognize additional development revenues from our regenerative cell technology segment during  as the anticipated completion for the next phase of our joint venture and other olympus product development performance obligations is in if we are successful in achieving certain milestone points related to these activities  we may recognize approximately  in revenues in the exact timing of when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal factors for instance  our ability to complete certain contributions and obligations that we have agreed to perform as well as e xternal considerations  including obtaining certain regulatory clearances and or approvals related to the celution system 
the cash for these contributions and obligations was received when the agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the thin film development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance from the mhlw 
we are still awaiting regulatory clearance from the mhlw in order for initial commercialization to occur 
we would recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement if and when regulatory approval is achieved 
moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercialization  if achieved  as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  regulatory fees  the purchase of laboratory supplies  pre clinical studies  and clinical studies

these expenses  in conjunction with our continued development efforts related to our celution system  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors during the last few years 
labor related expenses  not including share based compensation  decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the decrease in headcount for our research and development department as a result of a reduction in force implemented by the management at the end of the first quarter of and third quarter of in efforts to cut costs as well as achievement of commercialization and transfer of employees from research and development to the manufacturing department 
professional services expense decreased by  from to  primarily due to decreased use of consultants and temporary labor during the year ended december  expenses for supplies decreased by  from to  primarily due to purchases of production supplies prior to the related product line commercialization  which occurred on march  these reductions were offset by an increase of  from to due primarily to increased clinical study activitiy and the associated expense

the following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended general and administrative stock based compensation total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to a decrease in professional services expense of  for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in  partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  these decreases resulted from management efforts to decrease costs 
general and administrative expense  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in decreased by  the decrease in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily from a decrease in legal fees related to the patent litigation with the university of pittsburgh of  and a decrease in salary and related benefit expense  excluding share based compensation of  for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in the future 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be further reduced in compared to the prior three years as we are seeking ways to minimize these expenses where possible 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expenses include charges related to options issued to employees  directors and non employees 
prior to january   the stock based compensation expenditures connected to options granted to employees and directors in their capacity as board members was the difference between the exercise price of the stock based awards and the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
unearned employee stock based compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options  which generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant 
from january  onwards  we measure stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of any awards granted to our employees 
such expense is recognized over the period of time that employees provide service to us and earn all rights to the awards 
stock based compensation expense related to options to purchase common stock issued to non employees is based on the fair value of the stock on the date of issuance  even if such stock contains sales restrictions

as of december   the total compensation cost related to non vested stock options not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately  these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
change in fair value of warrant liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of warrant liability for the years ended december   and years ended december  change in fair value of warrant liability in august  we issued common stock purchase warrants in connection with our private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
see critical accounting policies and significant estimates in the later section of the item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow  fair value of any asset  liability or any net investment in a foreign operation 
the warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  and as such  all future changes in the fair value of these warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securiti es market  and as such  we estimate the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions as of december  expected term years common stock market price risk free interest rate expected volatility resulting fair value per warrant expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is based on three year us treasury securities 
the future 
future changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
change in fair value of option liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liability for the years ended december   and years ended change in fair value of option liability in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the value of the put has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate 
the following assumptions were employed in estimating the value of the put december  december  december  expected volatility of cytori expected volatility of the joint venture bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori bankruptcy threshold for cytori probability of a change of control event for cytori expected correlation between fair values of cytori and the joint venture in the future risk free interest rate the future 
the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets was  for the year ended december  there was no gain on sale of assets for the years ended december  and in may  we sold to kensey nash our intellectual property rights and tangible assets related to our spine and orthopedic bioresorbable implant product line  a part of our macropore biosurgery business for  and recognized a gain of  net of expenses 
excluded from the sale was our japan thin film product line 
financing items the following table summarizes interest income  interest expense  and other income and expenses for the years ended december   and years ended interest income interest expense other income expense total interest income decreased for the year december  as compared to the same period in and primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense increased in and as compared to due to interest incurred as well as non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with a term loan 
in october  we entered into a secured loan agreement with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank lenders to borrow up to  an initial term loan of  less fees and expenses  funded on october  the changes in other income expense in  and resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the future 
interest income earned in will be dependent on our levels of funds available for investment as well as general economic conditions 
subject to our future financing activities  we expect interest expense to remain relatively consistent in as we continue to repay the term loan balance 
equity loss from investment in joint venture the following table summarizes equity loss from investment in joint venture for the years ended december   and years ended equity loss from investment in joint venture the losses relate entirely to our equity interest in the joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
the future 
we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next one to two years  the joint venture is expected to incur labor costs related to the development of our second generation commercial system as well as general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty and other revenue expected to be generated by our current celution crs and future generation devices 
though we have no obligation to do so  we plan to contribute funding to the joint venture t o cover any costs should the joint venture deplete its cash balance 
liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures at december  and as of december  cash and cash equivalents current assets current liabilities working capital we incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of   and  to fund our operating activities for years ended december   and  respectively 
to date these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital 
during  we expanded our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth 
we have had  and continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations 
if we are to be successful  we must increase revenues or raise outside capital in the future 
if we cannot do so  we will be required to further reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reductions of our employee base  in order to offset the lack of available funding 
we are continuing to evaluate available financing opportunities as part of our normal course of business 
we have an established history of raising capital through these platforms  and we are currently involved in discussions with multiple parties 
in march  we raised approximately  in gross proceeds from the sale to institutional investors of a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to a total of  additional shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per unit  with each unit consisting of one share and one and four tenths warrants with an exercise price of per share 
in may  we raised approximately   in gross proceeds from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants at a purchase price of per unit  with each unit consisting of one share and one and three fourths warrants with an exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors 
additionally  in june  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp relating to the offering and sale of a total of up to  shares of our common stock 
the agreement requires us to issue and seaside to buy  shares of our common stock once every two weeks  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  with the offering price equal to of our common stock s volume weighted avera ge trading price during the ten day trading period immediately preceding each closing date 
if with respect to any subsequent closing  our common stock s ten day volume weighted average trading price is below per share  then the closing will not occur 
we raised approximately  in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares through december  pursuant to this agreement 
we expect to continue to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through the next twelve months  subject to minimum cash and cash liquidity requirements of the loan and security agreement with the lenders  which requires that we maintain at least three months of cash on hand to avoid an event of default under the loan and security agreement 
we continue to seek additional cash through product revenues  strategic collaborations  and future sales of equity or debt securities 
to the extent closing conditions are met  we expect the seaside  lp agreement will significantly extend our available resources and may reduce our need for alternate financing 
subsequent to the year ended december   we completed five scheduled closings with seaside  lp raising in aggregate approximately  in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
although there can be no assurance given  we hope to successfully complete one or more additional financing transactions or corporate partnerships in the future including future closings of the seaside  lp agreement 
without this additional capital  current working capital  cash generated from sales and containment of costs will not provide adequate funding for operations indefinitely at their current levels 
if such efforts are not successful  we will need to reduce operations and this could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals 
in this event  we would reduce certain operations to focus almost entirely on the supply of current products to existing or new distribution channels 
additionally  we received  in aggregate exercise purchase price for  of warrants that were exercised subsequent to the year ended december  in order to continue the operations of our regenerative cell business at or near current levels  we will need to either substantially increase revenues or continue to raise additional capital in the near term 
from inception to december   we have financed our operations primarily by issuing stock in pre ipo transactions  a initial public offering in germany  and stock option exercises  generating revenues  selling the bioresorbable implant cmf product line in september  selling the bioresorbable implant thin film product line except for the territory of japan  in may  licensing distribution rights to thin film in japan  in exchange for an upfront license fee in july and an initial development milestone payment in october  obtaining a modest amount of capital equipment long term financing  selling  shares of common stock to olympus under an agreement which closed in may  receiving upfront and milestone fees from our joint venture with olympus  which was entered into in november  receiving funds in exchange for granting olympus an exclusive right to negotiate in february  receiving  in net proceeds from a common stock sale under the shelf registration statement in august  receiving  in net proceeds from the sale of common stock plus common stock warrants under the shelf registration statement in february  receiving  in net proceeds from a private placement to green hospital supply  inc in april  receiving gross proceeds of  from the sale of our bioresorbable spine and orthopedic surgical implant product line to kensey nash in may  receiving  in net proceeds from a private placement to green hospital supply  inc during first half  receiving  in gross proceeds in august from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an original exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors including olympus corporation  who acquired  unregistered shares and  common stock warrants in exchange for  of the total proceeds raised  obtaining a term loan of  from general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank lenders in october  receiving approximately  in gross proceeds from sale to institutional investors of a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to a total of  additional shares of our common with an exercise price of per share in march receiving approximately  in gross proceeds from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors in may  and in june we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp relating to the offering and sale of a total of up to  shares of our common stock 
the agreement requires us to issue and seaside to buy  shares of our common stock once every two weeks  at a discounted ten day volume weighted average pricing formula  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
as of december   we raised an aggregate of approximately  in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
our cash requirements for and beyond will depend on numerous factors  including our successful revisions of our operating plan and business strategies as described above 
under our previous operating plan  we would have expected to incur research and development expenses at high levels in our regenerative cell platform for an extended period of time 
under the new plan  we will seek to reduce these expenditures as much as possible 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term obligations interest commitment on long term obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase requirements pre clinical research study obligations clinical research study obligations total net cash used in provided by operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and  is summarized as follows years ended net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities net cash used in operating activities for all periods presented resulted primarily from expenditures related to our regenerative cell research and development efforts 
research and development efforts and other operational activities  offset in part by product sales  generated a  net loss for the year ended december  the cash impact of this loss was  after adjusting for the recognition of  of deferred revenue  for which cash was received in earlier years  the consideration of non cash share based compensation of  other adjustments for material non cash activities  such as depreciation and amortization of  change in fair value of option liabilities of  and warrants of  non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount along with other changes in working capital due to timing of product shipments accounts receivable and payment of liabilities

research and development efforts  other operational activities  and a comparatively small amount of product sales generated a  net loss for the year ended december  the cash impact of this loss was  after adjusting for the recognition of  of deferred revenue  related party  recognized in  for which cash was received in earlier years   of gain on sale of assets   of depreciation and  non cash stock based compensation expense  along with other changes in working capital due to timing of product shipments accounts receivable and payment of liabilities 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  and resulted primarily from purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net proceeds from the purchase and sale of short term investments and proceeds from the sale of assets  offset in part by purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to a march equity offering of approximately  in gross proceeds to institutional investors for a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to a total of  additional shares of our common stock  may private placement of approximately  in gross proceeds to a syndicate of investors for a total of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants  and sale of  shares for approximately  in gross proceeds in connection with common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp entered into on june  the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  related mainly to the private issuance of  shares of unregistered common stock to green hospital supply  inc for  and the private placement offering of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an original exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors for approximately  in gross proceeds  of which olympus corporation acquired  unregistered shares and  common stock warrants in exchange for  of the total proceeds raised 
additionally  in october  we obtained a term loan in the amount of  less fees and expenses  from general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank together  the lenders 
the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  related mainly to the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants under the shelf registration statement in exchange for net proceeds of  as well as a common stock private placement made with green hospital supply  inc for net proceeds of  net cash proceeds provided by financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  offset to some extent by principal payments on long term obligations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 
we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
warrant liability effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain common stock purchase warrants with exercise price reset features due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
these warrants were issued in connection with our august private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
the warrants had an original exercise price of and expire in august under the new standard  these warrants previously recognized in stockholders equity deficit are now accounted for as fair value liabilities  with changes in fair value included in net earnings loss 
the cumulative effect of the adoption is to present these warrants as liabilities on the date of the adoption as if they had been accounted for as liabilities since the warrants were issued 
as a result on january   we recognized a million long term warrant liability  a million decrease in accumulated deficit and a corresponding decrease in additional paid in capital of million 
the fair value of these warrants increased to million as of december   which resulted in a million loss from the change in fair value of warrants for the year ended december  since these warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  all future changes in the fair value of the warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these warrants are not traded in an active securities market  and as such  we estimated the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions as of december  as of january  expected term years years common stock market price risk free interest rate expected volatility resulting fair value per warrant expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the federal reserve board that is clos est to the expected term of the warrant 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for celution crs system sales to customers who arrange for and manage the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent use or resale of our product 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
when more than one element such as product maintenance or technical support services are included in an arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged w hen the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
fair values for undelivered elements are determined based on vendor specific objective evidence as well as market participant quotes for similar services 
deferred service revenue is recognized ratably over the period the services are provided 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
concentration of significant customers for the year ended december   our sales were concentrated with three distributors and one direct customer  which in aggregate comprised of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  our asia pacific  north america and europe region sales accounted for of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  additionally  one distributor and two end customers accounted for of total outstanding accounts receivable as of december  we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of our distributors and believe our sales to diverse end customers and to diverse geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk 
research and development we earn revenue for performing tasks under research and development agreements with both commercial enterprises  such as olympus and senko  and governmental agencies like the national institutes of health nih 
revenue earned under development agreements is classified as either research grant or development revenues depending on the nature of the arrangement 
revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants are presented in development revenues 
we record grant revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and de velopment expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  research and development arrangements we have with commercial enterprises such as olympus and senko are considered a key component of our central and ongoing operations 
accordingly  when recognized  the inflows from such arrangements are presented as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
we received funds from olympus and olympus cytori  inc during and we recorded upfront fees totaling  as deferred revenues  related party 
in exchange for these proceeds  we agreed to a provide olympus cytori  inc an exclusive and perpetual license to our celution system device technology and certain related intellectual property  and b provide future development contributions related to commercializing the celution system platform 
the license and development services are not separable under the revenue recognition topic of the codification 
the recognition of this deferred amount requires achievement of service related milestones  un der a proportional performance methodology 
if and as such revenues are recognized  deferred revenue will be decreased 
proportional performance methodology was elected due to the nature of our development obligations and efforts in support of the joint venture jv  including product development activities and regulatory efforts to support the commercialization of the jv products 
the application of this methodology uses the achievement of r d milestones as outputs of value to the jv 
we received up front  non refundable payments in connection with these development obligations  which we have broken down into specific r d milestones that are definable and substantive in nature  and which will result in value to the jv when achieved 
as our research and development efforts progress  we periodically evaluate  and modify if necessary  the milestone points in our proportional performance model to ensure that revenue recognition accurately reflects our best estimate of substantive value deliverable to the jv 
revenue will be recognized as the above mentioned r d milestones are completed 
of the amounts received and deferred  we recognized development revenues of   and   for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all related development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in research and development expense on the statement of operations 
under a distribution agreement with senko  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
we have also earned or will be entitled to earn additional payments under the distribution agreement based on achieving the defined research and development milestones 
there was no development revenue recognized during the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recognized  in development revenue 
goodwill impairment testing in late  we purchased stemsource  inc and recognized over  in goodwill associated with the acquisition  of which  remains on our balance sheet as of december  we test this goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
the application o the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 
moreover  this testing must be performed at a level of the organization known as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is at least the same level as a company s operating segments  and sometimes even one level lower 
our two reporting units are the same as our two operating segments 
specifically  the process for testing goodwill for impairment involves the following steps company assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are allocated to each reporting unit for purposes of completing the goodwill impairment test 
the carrying value of each reporting unit that is  the sum of all of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill may be impaired additional testing is required 
the application of the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
for instance  assets and liabilities must be assigned to a reporting unit if both of the following criteria are met the asset will be employed in or the liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit 
the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we developed mechanisms to assign company wide assets like shared property and equipment  as well as company wide obligations such as borrowings under our ge loan facility  to our two reporting units 
in some cases  certain assets were not allocable to either reporting unit and were left unassigned 
in  all goodwill that previously had been assigned to our macropore biosurgery reporting unit was derecognized as a result of our sale of our spine and orthopedic product line to kensey nash 
accordingly  there was no need to test this component of our business for goodwill impairment 
we completed our goodwill impairment testing for our regenerative cell technology reporting unit using an income based approach incorporating discounted projections of estimated future cash flows as well as a market based approach 
we concluded that for all periods presented  the fair value of this unit exceeded its carrying value  and that none of our reported goodwill was impaired 
again  the manner in which we assigned assets  liabilities  and goodwill to our reporting units  as well as how we determined the fair value of such reporting units  involves significant uncertainties and estimates 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 
variable interest entity olympus cytori joint venture a variable interest entity  or vie  must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether an entity is a vie and determining its primary beneficiary involves significant judgment 
we concluded that the olympus cytori joint venture was a vie based on the following factors an entity is a vie if it has insufficient equity to finance its activities 
we recognized that the initial cash contributed to the joint venture formed by olympus and cytori  would be completely utilized by the first quarter of moreover  it was highly unlikely that the joint venture would be able to obtain the necessary financing from third party lenders without additional subordinated financial support such as personal guarantees by one or both of the joint venture stockholders 
accordingly  the joint venture will require additional financial support from olympus and cytori to finance its ongoing operations  indicating that the joint venture is a vie 
in fact  we contributed  and  in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  to fund the jo int venture s ongoing operations 
moreover  olympus has a contingent put option that would  in specified circumstances  require cytori to purchase olympus s interests in the joint venture for a fixed amount of  accordingly  olympus is protected in some circumstances from absorbing all expected losses in the joint venture  and as such  olympus may not be an at risk equity holder  although olympus clearly has decision rights over the operations of the joint venture 
because the joint venture is undercapitalized  and because one of the joint venture s decision makers may be protected from losses  we have determined that the joint venture is a vie 
as noted previously  a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined as the entity that would absorb the majority of the vie s expected losses or be entitled to receive the majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
significant judgment was involved in determining the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
we believe that olympus and cytori are de facto agents and  together  will absorb more than of the joint venture s expected losses and residual returns 
ultimately  we concluded that olympus  and not cytori  was the party most closely related with the joint venture and  hence  its primary beneficiary 
our conclusion was based on the following factors the business operations of the joint venture will be most closely aligned to those of olympus ie  the manufacture of devices 
olympus controls the board of directors  as well as the day to day operations of the joint venture 
had we consolidated the joint venture  though  there would be no effect on our net loss or shareholders equity at december  or for the year then ended 
however  certain balance sheet and income statement captions would have been presented in a different manner 
for instance  we would not have presented a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet but  instead  would have performed a line by line consolidation of each of the joint venture s accounts into our financial statements 
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december  to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
we increased our valuation allowance by approximately  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance includes approximately  related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which  if realized  will eventually be credited to equity and not to income 
at december   we had federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and respectively  if unused 
at december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal credits will begin to expire in  if unused  and  of the state credits will begin to expire in if unused 
the remaining state credits carry forward indefinitely 
in addition  we had a foreign tax loss carryforward of  in japan   in italy  and  i n the united kingdom 
the internal revenue code limits the future availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in a change of control of cytori 
due to prior ownership changes as defined in irc section  a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are limited in their annual utilization 
in september  we experienced an ownership change for purposes of the irc section limitation 
as of december   these pre change net operating losses and credits are fully available 
additionally  in when we purchased stemsource  we acquired federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
this event triggered an ownership change for purposes of irc section it is estimated that the pre change net operating losses and credits are fully available 
we have completed an update to our irc section study analysis through april  we have not had any additional ownership changes based on this study 
recent accounting pronouncements see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
as of december   all excess funds were invested in money market funds and other highly liquid investments  therefore our interest rate exposure is not considered to be material 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in forei gn currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated
