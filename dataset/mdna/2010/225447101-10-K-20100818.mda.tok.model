item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we continue to make significant investments to expand our global sales  marketing  technical applications support and distribution capabilities 
most notably  we are sponsoring and participating in several initiatives to enable and further support the adoption of led lighting 
these include our led city  led workplace and led university programs 
we also continue to make investments to build market awareness of the cree brand 
our direct sales and marketing team is headquartered in north carolina 
we have a growing international sales  marketing and technical applications team  including personnel in the following locations austria japan china malaysia germany singapore great britain south korea hong kong sweden italy taiwan we plan to continue expanding our sales and marketing efforts globally to support our new product lines and promote the adoption of led lighting 
customers we have historically had a few key customers who represented more than of our consolidated revenues 
in fiscal  revenues from two of our distribution customers exceeded of our total consolidated revenues 
sales to arrow electronics  inc arrow and world peace industrial co  ltd 
world peace represented and of our total consolidated revenue  respectively  in fiscal for further discussion regarding customer concentration  please see note  concentrations of credit risk  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the loss of any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
distribution a substantial portion of our products are sold through distributors 
distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base  which may include value added resellers  manufacturers who incorporate 
table of contents our products into their own manufactured goods  or ultimate end users of our products 
we also utilize third party sales representatives who generally do not maintain a product inventory  instead  their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 
seasonality sales of our products can be subject to seasonal fluctuations and variations in customer demand 
if anticipated sales or shipments do not occur when expected  our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  may be adversely affected 
backlog our backlog at june   the last day of our fiscal year  was approximately million  compared with backlog of approximately million at june   the last day of our fiscal year 
because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which at times may be made without significant penalty  we do not believe that our backlog  as of any particular date  is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 
additionally  our june  backlog figure contains million of research contracts signed with the us government  for which approximately million were not appropriated as of the last day of fiscal our backlog could be adversely affected if the us government exercises its rights to terminate our government contracts or does not appropriate and allocate all of the funding contemplated by the contracts 
sources of raw materials we depend on a number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in our products  including certain key materials and equipment used in our crystal growth  wafering  polishing  epitaxial deposition  device fabrication  component and lighting assembly processes 
we generally purchase these limited source items pursuant to purchase orders and have limited guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
our suppliers  located around the world  can be subject to many constraints limiting supply that are beyond our control 
we believe our current supply of essential materials is sufficient to meet our needs 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
competition our success depends on our ability to keep pace with the evolving technology standards of the industries we serve 
these industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles and changes in end user and customer requirements in a competitive pricing environment 
the evolving nature of these industries may render our existing or future products obsolete  noncompetitive or unmarketable 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
led products led chips 
the primary competition for our led chip products comes from companies that manufacture and or sell nitride based led chips 
we consider nichia corporation nichia  which sells packaged leds and most often competes directly with our chip customers  to be a competitor 
nichia currently sells the majority of its packaged led products to markets requiring white leds  which nichia fabricates by combining its phosphor solution with blue led chips 
we believe  based on industry information  that nichia currently has the largest market share for nitride based leds 
many asia based chip producers also produce blue  green and white led products  such as epistar corporation and toyoda gosei co  ltd 
these competitors make products for a variety of applications in a range of performance levels that compete directly with our led chip products 

table of contents overall  we believe that performance  price and strength of intellectual property are the most significant factors to compete successfully in the nitride led market 
we believe our products are well positioned to meet the market performance requirements  however  there is significant pricing pressure from a number of competitors 
we continually strive to improve our competitive position by developing brighter and higher performing led chips while focusing on lowering costs 
led components 
the market for lighting class led components is concentrated primarily in indoor and outdoor commercial lighting  specialty lighting  including torch lamps flashlights  color changing architectural lighting  signs and signals  and emergency vehicle lighting for example  fire and rescue vehicles 
nichia  osram semiconductor gmbh osram and philips lumileds lighting company  llc are the main competitors in this market 
these companies sell led components that compete indirectly with our target customers for led chips and compete directly with our xlamp led components 
several other companies have products designed to compete with our xlamp led components  including avago technologies limited  edison opto corporation  kingbright corporation  samsung led company and seoul semiconductor co  ltd 
we are positioning our xlamp led components to compete in this market based on performance  price and usability 
our high brightness led components compete with a larger number of competitors around the world in a variety of applications including signage  video  automotive  gaming and specialty lighting 
we are positioning our high brightness led components to compete in this market based on performance  price  availability and usability 
led lighting 
our led lighting products currently face competition from lighting fixture companies  lamp manufacturers and from non traditional companies focused on led lighting systems including fixtures and bulbs 
our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent  fluorescent  halogen  ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology 
competitors include acuity brands lighting inc  cooper lighting  general electric company  osram  and royal philips electronics nv among others 
our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings  extended life  improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership 
also  our led lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury 
we also compete with led based products from traditional and non traditional lamp and fixture companies  some of whom are customers for our led chips and led components 
our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency  superior light output  reduced energy consumption  brand and lower total cost of ownership 
sic wafers 
we have continued to maintain our well established quality and volume leadership position in the sale of sic wafer and sic and gan epitaxy products 
we are seeing increased competition in this market 
power and rf products power devices 
our sic based power devices compete with similar devices offered by infineon technologies ag and stmicroelectronics 
there are also a number of other companies developing sic based power devices 
in addition  our products compete with existing silicon based power devices offered by a variety of manufacturers 
rf devices 
currently  sumitomo electric device innovations  inc is the main company offering products that compete directly with our sic mesfet and gan hemt products  although several other companies such as rf micro devices inc  nitronex corporation and triquint corporation have products that compete with us as well 
our products also face competition from existing silicon and gaas based products 

table of contents patents and other intellectual property rights we believe it is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  including rights under patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws 
we seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the united states and other countries when appropriate 
we have also acquired  through license grants and assignments  rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others 
as of june   we owned or held exclusive rights under issued us patents and approximately  foreign patents with various expiration dates extending up to we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any one patent  and we believe our business will not be materially adversely affected by the expiration of any one patent 
for proprietary technology that is not patented  we generally seek to protect the technology and related know how and information as trade secrets by keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 
we attempt to create strong brands for our products and promote our products through trademarks that distinguish them in the market 
we may license our customers to use our trademarks in connection with the sale of our products  and we monitor for the proper and authorized use of our marks 
licensing activities and lawsuits to enforce intellectual property rights  particularly patent rights  are a common feature of the semiconductor and led industries  and we attempt to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights through appropriate actions 
the breadth of our intellectual property rights and the extent to which they can be successfully enforced vary across jurisdictions 
we both make and receive inquiries regarding possible patent infringements and possible violations of other intellectual property rights in the normal course of business 
depending on the circumstances  we may seek to negotiate a license or other acceptable resolution 
if we are unable to achieve a resolution by agreement  we may seek to enforce our rights or defend our position through litigation 
patent litigation in particular is expensive and the outcome is often uncertain 
we believe that the strength of our portfolio of patent rights is important in helping us resolve or avoid such disputes with other companies in our industry 
environmental regulation we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes 
failure to comply with such provisions  whether intentional or inadvertent  could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties  injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
working capital for a discussion of our working capital practices  see liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report 
employees as of june   we employed  regular full and part time employees 
we also employ individuals on a temporary full time basis and use the services of contractors as necessary 
certain of our employees in various countries outside of the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to these employees 
we consider relations with our employees to be good

table of contents item a 
risk factors described below are various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant challenges managing our growth 
we have experienced a period of significant growth over the past few years that may challenge our management and other resources 
we continue to transform our business to support a global led components and led lighting product customer base  while continuing to support our other businesses 
in order to manage our growth and business strategy effectively  we must continue to maintain  expand and purchase adequate manufacturing facilities and equipment to meet customer demand  maintain a sufficient supply of raw materials to support our growth  expand research and development  sales and marketing  technical support  distribution capabilities and administrative functions  expand the skills and capabilities of our current management team  add experienced senior level managers  and attract and retain qualified employees 
while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses  over the long term we expect to invest substantially to support our growth and may have additional unexpected costs 
for example  we recently purchased a  square foot facility in huizhou  guangdong province  china to support led chip and future led component production 
however  such investments take time to become fully operational  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit targeted market opportunities 
there are also inherent execution risks in starting up a new factory that could increase costs and reduce our operating results  including design and construction cost overruns  poor production process yields and reduced quality control during the start up phase 
we are also increasingly dependent on information technology to enable us to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency 
if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build  implement and sustain the proper technology infrastructure  we could be subject to transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  loss of customers  business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 
in connection with our efforts to cost effectively manage our growth  we have increasingly relied on subcontractors for production capacity  logistics support and certain administrative functions including hosting of certain information technology software applications 
if these service providers do not perform effectively  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors or fulfill customer demand 
depending on the function involved  such errors may also lead to business disruption  processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach  or impact employee morale 
our operations may also be negatively impacted if any of these service providers do not have the financial capability to meet our growing needs 
our results of operations  financial condition and business could be harmed if we were unable to balance customer demand and capacity 
as customer demand for our products changes  we must be able to ramp up or adjust our production capacity to meet demand 
we are continually taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity needs for our products 
for example  we purchased a  square foot facility in huizhou  guangdong province  china to 
table of contents support led chip and future led component production 
if we are not able to increase our production capacity at our targeted rate  or if there are unforeseen costs associated with adjusting our capacity levels  we may not be able to achieve our financial targets 
conversely  due to the proportionately high fixed cost nature of our business such as facility expansion costs  if demand does not increase at the rate forecasted  we may not reach our targeted operating margins due to excess facilities and manufacturing capacity 
additionally  if demand decreases  we may not be able to reduce manufacturing expenses or overhead costs at the same rate as demand  which could also result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations 
inventory management also continues to be an area of focus for our growing business 
from time to time we have experienced rapid increases in demand for our products and as a consequence have seen some product lead time extensions 
longer quoted delivery lead times in the past have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and then seek to cancel the duplicative orders  delay future orders  or to place orders with other vendors with shorter quoted delivery lead times 
if such multiple ordering along with other factors were to occur  the increased risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting future sales and  as a result  could impair our ability to manage our inventory levels effectively 
in addition  our efforts to improve quoted delivery lead time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog 
a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter to quarter net sales and operating results 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have evolving technical requirements 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
in the led market  we compete with companies that manufacture or sell led chips and led components as well as those that sell led lighting products 
competitors continue to offer new led products with aggressive pricing and improved performance 
competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average sales prices 
with the growth potential for leds  we may face increased competition in the future 
for example  samsung has entered the led market and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company has announced its intention to enter the led market as well in 
additionally  new technologies could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that may also reduce the demand for leds in certain markets 
as competition increases  in order to continue to grow our business  we need to continue to develop new products that meet or exceed the needs of our customers 
additionally  we anticipate that increased competition will result in pressure to lower the selling prices of our products 
therefore  our ability to continually produce more efficient  higher brightness leds that meet the evolving needs of our customers at lower costs will be critical to our success 
competitors may also try to align with some of our strategic customers 
this could mean lower prices for our products  reduced demand for our products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development  engineering and manufacturing costs 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we fail to evaluate  and execute strategic opportunities successfully  our business may suffer 
from time to time we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us for product  technology or business transactions  such as business acquisitions or divestitures 
for example  in march we acquired cotco and in february we acquired llf 
if we choose to enter into such transactions we face certain risks  such as  failure of an acquired business to meet our performance expectations  diversion of management attention  retention of existing customers of our current and acquired businesses  and difficulty in integrating an acquired business s operations  personnel and financial and operating systems into our current business 

table of contents we may not be able to adequately address these risks or any other problems that arise from our recent or future acquisitions or divestitures 
any failure to successfully evaluate strategic opportunities and address risks or other problems that arise related to any such business transaction could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we are unable to effectively develop  manage and expand our distribution channels for our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have expanded into new business channels that are different from those that we have historically operated in as we grow our business and sell led lighting products and more led components versus led chips 
if we are unable to effectively penetrate these new channels or develop new channels to ensure our products are reaching the appropriate customer base  our financial results may be adversely impacted 
in addition  if we successfully penetrate or develop these new channels  we cannot guarantee that customers will accept our products or that we will be able to manufacture and deliver them in the timeline established by our customers 
a substantial portion of our products are sold through distributors 
we typically recognize revenue on product sold to distributors when the item is shipped and title passes to the distributor sell in method 
distributors must balance the need of having enough products in stock in order to meet their customer s needs against the risk of potential inventory obsolescence 
the risks of inventory obsolescence are especially true with technological products 
if our distributors do not properly anticipate demand from their customers  this could lead to distributors seeking to cancel orders or placing fewer orders with us  or otherwise make it more difficult for us to forecast future product demand 
our business may be adversely affected by uncertainties in the global financial markets and our  or our customers or suppliers  ability to access the capital markets 
global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained global economic recovery 
given these uncertainties  there could be future disruptions in the global economy  financial markets and consumer confidence 
if economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
for example  our customers  or their customers  may continue to experience difficulty obtaining financing necessary to support historical or projected purchasing patterns  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
although we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations internally  our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms in the future  or at all  may adversely affect our financial performance 
the inability to obtain adequate financing from debt or capital sources in the future could force us to self fund strategic initiatives or even forego certain opportunities  which in turn could potentially harm our performance 
our led revenues are highly dependent on our customers ability to produce  market and sell more integrated products using our led products 
because our customers generally integrate our led products into the products that they produce  market and sell  our led revenues depend on getting our led products designed into a larger number of our customers products and in turn  our customers ability to produce  market and sell their led products 
for example  we have current and prospective customers that create  or plan to create  lighting systems using our led components 
however  the traditional lighting industry is still developing technical expertise with led related designs  which may limit the success of our customers products 
even if our customers are able to develop and produce led lighting products  there can be no assurance that our customers will be successful in marketing and selling these products in the marketplace 

table of contents we also have current and prospective customers that create white led components using our blue leds  in combination with phosphors 
sales of blue led chips are highly dependent upon our customers ability to procure efficient phosphors  develop high quality and highly efficient white led components and gain access to the necessary intellectual property rights 
even if our customers are able to develop competitive white led components using our blue led chips  there can be no assurance that our customers will be successful in the marketplace 
as a result of our continued expansion into new markets existing customers may reduce orders 
through acquisitions and organic growth  we continue to expand into new markets 
in these new markets  some of our current customers may now perceive us as a competitor 
in response  our customers may reduce their orders for our products 
this reduction in orders could occur faster than our sales growth in these new markets  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results are substantially dependent on the development and acceptance of new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop new and lower cost solutions for existing and new markets and for customers to accept those solutions 
we must introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner  and we must secure production orders for those products from our customers 
the development of new products is a highly complex process  and we historically have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems  and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful 
the successful development and introduction of these new products depends on a number of factors  including the following achievement of technology breakthroughs required to make commercially viable devices  the accuracy of our predictions for market requirements and evolving standards  acceptance of our new product designs  acceptance of new technology in certain markets  the availability of qualified research and development personnel  our timely completion of product designs and development  our ability to expand sales and influence key customers to adopt our products  our ability to develop repeatable processes to manufacture new products in sufficient quantities  with the desired specifications and at competitive costs for commercial sales  our ability to effectively transfer products and technology developed in one country to our manufacturing facilities in other countries  our customers ability to develop competitive products incorporating our products  and acceptance of our customers products by the market 
if any of these or other factors becomes problematic  we may not be able to develop and introduce these new products in a timely or cost effective manner 

table of contents variations in our production yields could impact our ability to reduce costs and could cause our margins to decline and our operating results to suffer 
all of our products are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex 
the number of usable items  or yield  from our production processes may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including but not limited to the following variability in our process repeatability and control  contamination of the manufacturing environment  equipment failure  power outages  system failures or variations in the manufacturing process  lack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts and other raw materials  and other bill of materials items  production yield loss  inventory shrinkage or human errors  defects in production processes including system assembly either within our facilities or at our subcontractors  and any transitions or changes in our production process  planned or unplanned 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on new products  which has adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future  and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
in addition  our ability to convert volume manufacturing to larger diameter substrates can be an important factor in allowing for a more cost effective manufacturing process 
if we are unable to make this transition in a timely or cost effective manner  our results could be negatively impacted 
in some instances  we may offer products for future delivery at prices based on planned yield improvements or increased cost efficiencies from other production advances 
failure to achieve these planned improvements or advances could significantly affect our margins and operating results 
if our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations  we could incur significant additional costs  including costs associated with the recall of those items 
the manufacture of our products involves highly complex processes 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to replace or rework the products 
in some cases  our products may contain undetected defects or flaws that only become evident after shipment 
even if our products meet standard specifications  our customers may attempt to use our products in applications they were not designed for or in products that were not designed or manufactured properly  resulting in product failures and creating customer satisfaction issues 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time and defects or failures may occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we may need to recall our products 
these recalls could result in significant losses due to costs associated with the removal  collection and destruction of the product recalled  payments made to replace recalled product  a rise in warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  the write down or destruction of existing inventory subject to the recall  lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time  
table of contents delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  or increased product returns 
we also may be the target of product liability lawsuits  and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us if the use of our products at issue is determined to have caused injury 
a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity  damage to our reputation  and a loss of customer confidence in our products 
litigation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are often involved in patent infringement litigation as described in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
defending against existing and potential litigation will likely require significant attention and resources and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses  which could adversely affect our results unless covered by insurance or recovered from third parties 
if our defenses are ultimately unsuccessful  or if we are unable to achieve a favorable resolution  we could be liable for damage awards that could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
where necessary  we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day to day operations 
moreover  there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation 
our business may be impaired by claims that we  or our customers  infringe intellectual property rights of others 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize our industry 
these traits have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
litigation to determine the validity of patents or claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights could result in significant legal expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  even if the litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of products found to be infringing  incur asset impairment charges  discontinue the use of processes found to be infringing  expend significant resources to develop non infringing products or processes  or obtain a license to use third party technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not attempt to assert infringement claims against us  or our customers  with respect to our products 
in addition  our customers may face infringement claims directed to the customer s products that incorporate our products  and an adverse result could impair the customer s demand for our products 
we have also promised certain of our customers that we will indemnify them in the event they are sued by our competitors for infringement claims directed to the products we supply 
under these indemnification obligations we may be responsible for future payments to resolve infringement claims against them 
from time to time we receive correspondence asserting that our products or processes are or may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
if we believe the assertions may have merit or in other appropriate circumstances  we take steps to seek to obtain a license or to avoid the infringement 
however  we cannot predict 
table of contents whether a license will be available  that we would find the terms of any license offered acceptable  or that we would be able to develop an alternative solution 
failure to obtain a necessary license or develop an alternative solution could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and costs and to suspend the manufacture of affected products 
there are limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our intellectual property position is based in part on patents owned by us and patents exclusively licensed to us 
we intend to continue to file patent applications in the future  where appropriate  and to pursue such applications with us and foreign patent authorities 
however  our existing patents are subject to expiration and we cannot be sure that additional patents will be issued on any new applications around the covered technology or that our existing or future patents will not be successfully contested by third parties 
also  since issuance of a valid patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative  non infringing technology  we cannot be sure that any of our patents  or patents issued to others and licensed to us  will provide significant commercial protection  especially as new competitors enter the market 
we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others  and therefore  may adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of customer preference away from our products 
we also rely on trade secrets and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities 
we try to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy  including requiring employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached 
we also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets  or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
our operations in foreign countries  including china and other asian countries  expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of acquisitions and organic growth  we have operations  manufacturing facilities and subcontract arrangements in foreign countries that expose us to certain risks 
for example  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect our revenues  expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our financial statements 
we are also subject to other types of risks  including the following protection of intellectual property and trade secrets  tariffs  customs and other barriers to importing exporting materials and products in a cost effective and timely manner  timing and availability of export licenses  rising labor costs  disruptions in or inadequate infrastructure of the foreign countries where we operate  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
table of contents the burden of complying with foreign and international laws and treaties  and the burden of complying with and changes in international taxation policies 
in some instances  we have been provided and may continue to receive competing incentives from foreign governments to encourage our investment in certain countries  regions  or areas outside of the united states 
in particular  we have received and may continue to receive such incentives in connection with our operations in china  as the chinese national and local governments seek to encourage the development of the technology industry in china 
government incentives may include tax rebates  reduced tax rates  favorable lending policies and other measures  some or all of which may be available to us due to our foreign operations 
any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time 
any reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our operations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
these same governments also may provide increased incentives to or require production processes that favor local companies  which could further negatively impact our business and results of operations 
abrupt political change  terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries  which could also result in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are subject to risks related to international sales and purchases 
we expect that revenue from international sales will continue to represent the majority of our total revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from sales to non us customers  with approximately of revenue from sales to customers in hong kong and china 
as such  a significant slowdown in these foreign economies or lower investments in new infrastructure could have a negative impact on our sales 
we also purchase a portion of the materials included in our products from overseas sources 
our international sales and purchases are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including  without limitation  tariffs  trade barriers  regulations relating to import export control  technology transfer restrictions  the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act  the foreign corrupt practices act and the anti boycott provisions of the us export administration act 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we could be liable for administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  and in the extreme case  we could be suspended or debarred from government contracts or our export privileges could be suspended  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
international sales and purchases are also subject to a variety of other risks  including risks arising from currency fluctuations  collection issues and taxes 
our international sales are subject to variability as our selling prices become less competitive in countries with currencies that are declining in value against the us dollar and more competitive in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar 
in addition  our international purchases can become more expensive if the us dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we are billed 
we have not entered into any foreign currency derivative financial instruments  however  we may choose to do so in the future in an effort to manage or hedge our foreign exchange rate risk 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by  one or more of these customers could adversely affect our operating results 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for example  in fiscal  two distribution customers  arrow and world peace  individually accounted for more than of our net revenue  for a combined total of of our total net revenue 
sales to these and most of our other large customers are made on a purchase order basis  which does not generally require any long term customer 
table of contents commitments 
therefore  these customers may alter their past purchasing behavior with little or no notice to us for various reasons  including developing  or  in the case of our distributors  their customers developing  their own product solutions  choosing to purchase product from our competitors  or experiencing a reduction in their market share in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if our customers alter their past or expected purchasing behavior  or if we encounter any problems collecting amounts due from them  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we rely on a number of key sole source and limited source suppliers  and are subject to high price volatility on certain commodity inputs 
we depend on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers for certain raw materials  components  services and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials and equipment used in critical stages of our manufacturing processes 
although alternative sources generally exist for these items  qualification of many of these alternative sources could take up to six months or longer 
where possible  we attempt to identify and qualify alternative sources for our sole and limited source suppliers 
we generally purchase these sole or limited source items with purchase orders  and we have limited guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
we do not control the time and resources that these suppliers devote to our business  and we cannot be sure that these suppliers will perform their obligations to us 
additionally  general shortages in the marketplace of certain raw materials or key components  such as passive electrical components used in led lighting applications  may adversely impact our business 
in the past  we have experienced decreases in our production yields when suppliers have varied from previously agreed upon specifications that have impacted our cost of sales 
additionally  the inability of our suppliers to access capital efficiently could cause disruptions in their businesses  thereby negatively impacting ours 
this risk may increase if the general economic downturn negatively affects key suppliers or a significant number of our other suppliers 
any delay in product delivery or other interruption or variation in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting commercial demand for our products 
if we were to lose key suppliers  our key suppliers were unable to support our demand for any reason  or we were unable to identify and qualify alternative suppliers  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted or hampered significantly 
we rely on arrangements with independent shipping companies  such as federal express and united parcel service  for the delivery of our products from vendors and to customers in both the united states and abroad 
the failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security 
in our fabrication process we consume a number of precious metals and other commodities  which are subject to high price volatility 
our operating margins could be significantly affected if we are not able to anticipate price changes correctly  or if we are not able to pass along price increases to our customers 
in addition  production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water  silicon  electricity and gases 
future environmental regulations could restrict supply or increase the cost of certain of those materials as well 
changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in government administrations  such as the presidency and congress of the us as well as in the states and countries in which we operate  changes in tax laws or interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles  
table of contents the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including write offs of acquired in process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions  changes in available tax credits  the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions  the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock are less than those originally anticipated  and the repatriation of non us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes  or any changes in legislation that may result in these earnings being taxed within the us  regardless of our decision regarding repatriation of funds 
for example  current proposals have been made by various us governmental bodies to change the us tax laws that include  among other things  limiting us tax deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modifying the us foreign tax credit rules 
although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear  it is possible that these or other changes in us tax laws could increase our us income tax liability and adversely affect our profitability 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing that the proposed changes  if enacted  are to become effective 
any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods 
in addition  the determination of our income tax provision requires complex estimations  significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning the applicable tax laws 
to the extent our income tax liability materially differs from our income tax provisions and accruals due to factors  including the above  which were not anticipated at the time we estimated our tax provision  our net income or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse through the internet  which could harm our business and results of operations 
we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet to our information technology systems 
these attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage  or actions by hackers seeking to harm us 
we actively seek to prevent  detect and investigate any security incidents  but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects 
the theft and or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development  product development  and marketing could be reduced 
our business could be subject to significant disruption  and we could suffer monetary or other losses 
if government agencies discontinue or curtail their funding for our research and development programs  our business may suffer 
changes in federal budget priorities could adversely affect our contract revenue 
historically  government agencies have funded a significant portion of our research and development activities 
when the government changes budget priorities  such as in times of war or financial crisis  our funding has the risk of being redirected to other programs 
government contracts are also subject to the risk that the government agency may not 
table of contents appropriate and allocate all funding contemplated by the contract 
in addition  our government contracts generally permit the contracting authority to terminate the contracts for the convenience of the government 
the full value of the contracts would not be realized if they were prematurely terminated 
furthermore  we may be unable to incur sufficient allowable costs to generate the full estimated contract values and there is some risk that any technologies developed under these contracts may not have commercial value 
if government funding is discontinued or reduced  our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 
the manufacturing  assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties  fines  legal liabilities  and the forfeiture of certain tax benefits  suspension of production  alteration of our fabrication  assembly and test processes  and curtailment of our operations or sales 
in addition  our failure to manage the use  transportation  emission  discharge  storage  recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities 
existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment  modify our product designs or incur other expenses  such as permit costs  associated with such laws and regulations 
many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing  assembly and test processes or products 
any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business 
a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a natural disaster  health pandemic  such as an influenza outbreak within our workforce  or man made catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales  continuing production or performing other critical functions of our business  especially in the case of our single site for sic wafer and led fabrication 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption to our supply chain or any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies  including changes in the accounting regulations to be applied 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting policies and estimates in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item of this annual report 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 
likewise  our results of operations may be impacted due to changes in the accounting rules to be applied  such as the increased use of fair value measurement rules and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards 

table of contents in order to compete  we must attract  motivate and retain key employees  and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 
in order to compete  we must attract  motivate and retain executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales  marketing and support positions 
hiring and retaining qualified executives  scientists  engineers  technical staff and sales personnel are critical to our business  and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense 
to help attract  motivate and retain key employees  we use stock based compensation awards such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate  as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock  or if our share based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit  our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees could be weakened  which could harm our business and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
historically  our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of significant fluctuations in our revenue  earnings and margins over the past few years and variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts 
if our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors  our stock price will likely decline 
speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  or significant transactions can also cause changes in our stock price 
in particular  speculation around our market opportunities for energy efficient lighting may have dramatic effects on our stock price  especially as various government agencies announce their planned investments in energy efficient technology  including lighting 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired 
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our amortizable intangible assets and investments in equity interests for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill is determined to exist 
this could adversely impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio and in interest rates  and therefore  impairment of our investments or lower investment income could harm our earnings 
we are exposed to market value and the inherent interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other fixed interest rate investments 
the primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal and we only acquire investments rated aaa 
however  our investments are generally not fdic insured and may lose value and or become illiquid regardless of their rating

overview of our business and products we are a manufacturer of semiconductor materials and devices primarily based on sic  gan and related compounds 
we currently focus our expertise in sic and gan on led products  which consist of led chips  led components  led lighting products and sic wafers 
we also develop power and rf products  including power switching and rf devices 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our led products 
we also generate revenue from sales of power and rf products  and we earn revenue under government contracts that support some of our research and development programs to the extent the contract funding exceeds our direct cost of performing those activities 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led products 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of our led products 
our led products consist of our led chips  led components including our xlamp led components and modules and high brightness led components  led lighting products and sic wafers 
also included are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of led lighting 
power and rf products 
these products include power rectifiers made from sic  which provide faster switching speeds than comparable silicon based power devices  and also include rf devices made from sic or gan  which allow for higher power densities as compared to silicon or gallium arsenide 
also included are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of sic and gan based power and rf technology 
the majority of our products are produced at our production facilities located in north carolina and china 
in some circumstances  we also use contract manufacturers for certain aspects of product fabrication 
operating segments we currently operate our business as one reportable segment 
in fiscal  we operated our business in two reportable segments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of the cree microwave segment  our silicon based rf and microwave semiconductor business located in sunnyvale  california 
effective december   we reported cree microwave as a discontinued operation 
for further information about this business closure  see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
industry dynamics our business is primarily focused on selling our led products 
leds are currently used in a variety of applications  including energy efficient indoor and outdoor lighting  lcd backlighting  video screens  gaming  signals  automotive applications and mobile phones 
as led technology continues to develop and improve  we believe the potential market for led lighting applications will continue to expand 

table of contents select industry factors affecting our business include  among others overall demand for products and applications using leds 
we have seen increased adoption of leds in lighting products over the last fiscal year 
also  the global adoption of leds in certain consumer applications  such as televisions  has increased as well 
the pace of adoption of led lighting technology and overall market growth in the general illumination market and others will impact the demand for leds 
intense and constantly evolving competitive environment 
competition in the industry is intense and new companies are entering the led market 
product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share 
to remain competitive  market participants generally must increase product performance and reduce costs to offset lower average sales prices 
technological innovation and advancement 
innovations and advancements in led technology continue to expand the potential commercial application of leds particularly in the general illumination market 
however  new technologies could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that may reduce the demand for leds in certain markets 
energy costs 
led lighting technology can be more energy efficient than most traditional lighting technologies and can yield substantial reductions in energy usage for consumers 
the opportunity to lower energy costs using led lighting has driven increased demand for more energy efficient lighting solutions 
regulatory actions concerning energy efficiency 
many countries  including nations in the european union  australia  japan  malaysia  and the united states among others  have already instituted  or have announced plans to institute government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency  even in some cases banning forms of incandescent lighting  which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds 
intellectual property issues 
market participants rely on patented and non patented proprietary information relating to product development  manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business 
protection of intellectual property is critical 
therefore  steps such as additional patent applications  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements  as well as other security measures are generally taken 
to enforce or protect intellectual property rights  litigation or threatened litigation commonly occurs 
fiscal highlights the following is a summary of key financial results and certain non financial results achieved for the year ended june  our revenues for the year increased to million 
we experienced strong sales growth in our led products  which increased million or from the prior year 
revenues increased year over year across all our led products with the strongest growth from our led components 
our gross margin gross profit as a percent of revenue increased to from in the prior year  reflecting the benefits of higher volume and scale  our efforts to improve our production yields  a favorable pricing environment and an expansion of our product portfolio 
we achieved operating income of approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal we generated positive cash flow from operations of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal combined cash  cash equivalents and investments increased million or to approximately billion at june  compared to million at june  in september of we issued and sold million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents business outlook we project that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal we anticipate focusing on the following key areas  among others  in response to this competitive environment build on our leadership in led lighting 
we plan to continue to be a catalyst for led lighting adoption by developing innovative products that lead the market and enable new applications for led lighting 
for example  we are focusing our efforts on adding new channels to complement our existing commercial channels to make the cr down light  our new lower cost offering  available for a broad market release later in calendar year better enable our customers to develop high quality led based lighting products 
we want to facilitate our customer s ability to create and successfully release high quality led based lighting products 
to accomplish this objective  we plan to continue to develop higher performing led components that increase the value proposition for led lighting and reduce their initial cost 
we also plan to offer more highly integrated products  like our lmr led module 
additionally  we plan to expand our customer support capabilities 
expand and enhance our production capacity 
we plan to invest in the capacity to drive scale and accelerate our transition to mm wafer production 
we are currently targeting capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal to expand our production capacity at multiple points along the led manufacturing process  including our plan to more than double our xlamp led component capacity 
in addition  we plan to increase research and development spending to accelerate our efforts around our mm wafer capabilities  as we believe this is a critical investment to keep cree at the forefront of the technology curve and continue to drive cost reductions 
continue to invest in and grow our sic power product line 
we have experienced growing sales of our sic power products in recent quarters 
we have also seen rising demand for energy efficient power switching technology and believe this product line is well positioned to grow over the next several years 
to participate in this market  we plan to release our first sic switch product in fiscal  which we believe will expand the market opportunity for our products 
as a result  we are working to bring new capital equipment on line to support this anticipated growth

amortization of acquisition related intangibles as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded various intangible assets including customer relationships and developed technologies 
during fiscal  we acquired intrinsic semiconductor corporation and cotco  resulting in million of amortizable intangible assets principally composed of customer relationships and developed technology 
in fiscal  we acquired llf  resulting in an additional million of amortizable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were principally composed of developed technology that specifically relates to technologies underlying the development of led lighting products for the general illumination market 
amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions is as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to intrinsic cotco llf total amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in scheduled amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of cotco 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of cotco in fiscal as certain assets were fully amortized during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of llf in fiscal as we included a full year of amortization in fiscal as opposed to less than two quarters in fiscal loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets we operate a capital intensive business 
as such  we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change whether due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes

during fiscal  we sold  shares of color kinetics common stock 
as of june  we had fully liquidated our holdings in color kinetics stock 
net interest income decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily due to a continued decline in interest rates 
we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other fixed interest rate investments

other non operating income is comprised primarily of miscellaneous foreign exchange gains and losses 
income tax expense the following table sets forth our income tax expense in dollars and our effective tax rate from continuing operations in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income tax expense effective tax rate on continuing operations we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal as compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the variation between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate of is primarily due to the consolidation of our foreign operations  which are generally subject to income taxes at lower statutory rates 
a change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on our periodic effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the lack of sufficient 
table of contents excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock are less than those originally anticipated 
in addition  current proposals have been made by various us governmental bodies to change the us tax laws that include  among other things  limiting us tax deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modifying the us foreign tax credit rules 
although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear  it is possible that these or other changes in us tax laws  or tax laws in other countries we operate in  could increase our income tax liability and adversely affect our profitability 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing that any proposed changes  if enacted  would become effective 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in fiscal  we discontinued the operations of our cree microwave subsidiary 
the following table sets forth our income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax during fiscal  we recorded after tax losses of million from our discontinued operations compared to after tax income of million in fiscal for fiscal  our losses were primarily attributable to continued expenses arising from our sunnyvale facility operating lease that was associated with the operations of our discontinued cree microwave subsidiary 
the lease was terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the income was due primarily to our sale of certain patents associated with our cree microwave business that resulted in a net gain of million  which was then offset by continued expenses arising from the sunnyvale facility operating lease 
liquidity and capital resources overview we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  and to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  marketable investments and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating  financing and investing needs 
we have no debt or lines of credit and have minimal lease commitments 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments  and cash generated from operations  and our ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  contractual obligations  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities  including potential acquisitions  divestitures or investments in complementary businesses and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
we may also access capital markets through the issuance of new debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities 

table of contents contractual obligations at june   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non cancelable operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through august all of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent up to specific limits  property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recorded as rent expense  if applicable 
purchase obligations generally relate to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials  supplies and capital equipment 
our purchase obligations represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
if the operations acquired through the llf acquisition meet the conditions necessary for the earn out payment during calendar year  additional consideration of up to million would become payable to the former shareholders of llf during fiscal financial condition the following table sets forth our cash  cash equivalents and investments dollars in thousands june  june  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash and investments 
table of contents our liquidity and capital resources depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital 
our working capital increased to billion as of june  from billion at june   primarily due to proceeds received from our follow on offering of common stock  positive cash flows from operations and cash generated through the exercise of employee stock options 
the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle june  june  change days of sales outstanding a days of supply in inventory b days in accounts payable c cash conversion cycle a days of sales outstanding dso calculates the average collection period of our receivables 
dso is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue for the quarter then ended 
dso is calculated by adding ending accounts receivable  net of applicable allowances and reserves  and dividing that sum by the average net revenue per day for the respective quarter 
b days of supply in inventory dsi measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product 
dsi is based on ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dsi is calculated by dividing inventory by average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
c days in accounts payable dpo calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment 
dpo is based on ending accounts payable and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dpo is calculated by dividing accounts payable by the average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
overall we significantly improved our cash conversion cycle  primarily due to a more linear sales pattern throughout the year 
as of june   substantially all of our investments had investment grade ratings  and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at june  were in such position due to interest rate changes  sector credit rating changes or company specific rating changes 
as we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value  we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities 
when evaluating our investments for possible impairment  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis  the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
the declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  we do not believe these securities are impaired as of june  we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we have and may continue to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents  or funds underlying our marketable securities  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
with our strong working capital position  we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and  when appropriate  make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio  secure key intellectual properties  or expand our production capacity 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal 
table of contents cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash provided by financing activities effects of foreign exchange changes net increase in cash and cash equivalents the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to higher year over year net income  offset in part due to larger receivable and inventory balances to support higher sales volumes 
cash provided by operating activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from our customers  increased year over year operating income  and improvements in the management of our inventory 
cash flow from investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our investments  strategic acquisitions  purchase of property  plant and equipment and purchases of patent and or license rights 
net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in cash available for investments as a result of the issuance and sale of million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million and a year over year increase in the amount of cash received from employee stock option exercises 
in addition  we increased capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of our anticipated growth 
cash used in investing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to lower maturities of investments partially offset by lower purchases of investments and the payment of the cotco contingent consideration 
as part of the acquisition of cotco  we made a cash payment of million to the former shareholder of cotco in fiscal as the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition achieved certain defined ebitda targets for the year ended june   we were contractually obligated to make a payment in the amount of approximately million to the former shareholder of cotco in fiscal  which we elected to pay in cash 
these additional payments were reflected as an increase to goodwill in our consolidated financial statements 
llf met the conditions necessary for the earn out payment for the calendar year ended december  and as a result  the company made a cash payment in the amount of million to the former shareholders of llf in the third quarter of fiscal  thus increasing goodwill in the company s consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
llf met the conditions necessary for the earn out payment for the calendar year ended december  and as a result  the company made a cash payment in the amount of million to the former shareholders of llf in the third quarter of fiscal  thus increasing goodwill in the company s consolidated financial statements 
if llf meets the conditions necessary for the earn out payment during the calendar year ending december   an additional contingent cash payment totaling up to million would become payable to the former shareholders of llf 
if such contingent payment occurs  it will be considered as additional purchase price and result in an increase in goodwill 
we will continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures  while making strategic investments to develop our existing products  pursue strategic initiatives where appropriate and invest in our manufacturing and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
we target investing approximately million in fiscal for capital expenditures 
cash flow from financing activities typically our cash flows from financing activities are composed of cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases offset by cash outflows related to our repurchase of common stock  however  in fiscal  we also issued and sold common stock as described further below 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of the issuance and sale of million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million and a year over year increase in the amount of cash received from employee stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of lower spending on the repurchase of common stock partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
as of june   there remained approximately million shares of our common stock approved for repurchase under the repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
at the discretion of our management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party  whereas  unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

table of contents the financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short term investments 
the financial assets for which we may be required to perform non recurring fair value remeasurements eg  an impairment of assets are any investments in privately held companies 
as of june   financial assets utilizing level inputs included money market funds and investments traded on active securities exchanges 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included corporate bonds  municipal bonds and variable rate demand notes  and us agency securities 
level assets are valued using a third party pricing services consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources 
these sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in  where applicable  transactions of similar assets in active markets  transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets  interest rates  bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility 
we do not have any significant financial assets requiring the use of level inputs 
please refer to note  fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further information 
financial and market risks we are exposed to financial and market risks  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and investment risk 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks  however  we may choose to do so in the future 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at june  and june  actual results may differ materially 
interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
in order to minimize risk  we amended our cash management policy in fiscal to permit us to only acquire investments rated aaa grade or better going forward 
prior to that amendment  we were permitted to acquire investments rated a grade or better 
at june   we had million invested in these securities  compared to million at june  although these securities generally earn interest at fixed rates  the historical fair values of such investments have not differed materially from the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market price was approximately million at june  and million at june  currency exchange rates as we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities 
our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between the us dollar  the chinese renminbi  the hong kong dollar  the japanese yen and the euro 
investment risk we have made and may make future investments in public or privately held companies having operations or technologies in areas within our strategic focus 
these investments may be marketable in the case of investments in the common stock of other publicly traded companies or potentially non marketable in certain instances with investments in privately held companies 
whether marketable or non marketable  investments can be inherently risky as markets for the technologies or products of these companies may be in the early stages of development and may never materialize 
as of june   we have no significant investments in individual public or privately held companies 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our us and international facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of june  are detailed above in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in the application of us gaap we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates 
in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  tax related contingencies  valuation of inventories  contingencies and litigation  and accruals for other liabilities  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with us gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require a high degree of management judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates  each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our products are sold through distributors 
distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base  which may include value added resellers  manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods  or ultimate end users of our products 
in general  we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our distributors 
this arrangement is often referred to as a sell in or point of purchase model as opposed to a sell through or point of sale model  where revenue is deferred and not recognized until the distributor sells the product through to their customer 
our distributors may be provided rights that allow them to return a portion of inventory product exchange rights or stock rotation rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices price protection rights or other targeted sales incentives 

table of contents we also provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and product warranty claims 
in addition  certain of our sales arrangements provide for limited product exchanges and the potential for reimbursement of certain sales costs 
as a result  we record an allowance at the time of sale  which is recorded as a reduction of product revenue in the consolidated statements of income and as a reduction to accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate an allowance for anticipated sales returns based upon an analysis considering relevant facts and circumstances 
specifically  we review historical sales returns and other relevant data and match returns or other credits to the quarter when the sales were originally recorded 
based on historical return percentages and other relevant factors  we estimate our potential future exposure on product sales that have been recorded 
the allowance for sales returns  which includes allowances for price protection rights and other targeted sales incentives  at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
we also record an asset for the estimated value of product returns that we believe will be returned to inventory in the future and resold 
as of june  and june   we estimated the cost of future product returns at million and million  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for awards of stock based compensation under our employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method 
accordingly  we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currently use the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the inherent limitations of option valuation models available today  including future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock based awards  the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements 
for restricted stock awards  grant date fair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
this fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
we estimate expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of future activity 
the assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized  only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions  we may be required to adjust compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
recoverability of long lived assets our assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets involves significant judgment and estimation 
these assessments reflect our assumptions  which  we believe  are consistent with the assumptions hypothetical marketplace participants use 
factors that we must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volumes  prices  cost of capital  tax rates  and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
the second step is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
however  it should be noted that the loss recognized shall not be in excess of the carrying amount 
once a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying value shall be its new accounting basis 
we evaluate all other long lived assets such as property  equipment and definite lived intangible assets such as patents for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recorded in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets 
if so  an impairment loss is measured and recorded if the discounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets 
after an impairment loss is recognized  a new  lower cost basis for that long lived asset is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss 
our impairment loss calculations require that we apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including estimating useful lives of the assets 
to make these judgments  we may use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be required to record additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
we recorded million  million and million of long lived asset impairment charges during the fiscal years ended june   june   and june   respectively 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances during fiscal year  we released a valuation allowance on state income tax credits as it was determined that it was more likely than not the credits would be utilized entirely before their expiration 
the release of this valuation allowance resulted in a tax benefit of million 
further  we recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of million for net operating loss carryforwards in certain tax jurisdictions where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the losses will not be realized due to insufficient availability of taxable profits in the respective jurisdiction within the carryforward period resulting in an increase in tax expense of million 
as a result  the total change in the valuation allowance resulted in a million tax benefit 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
when we establish or increase a valuation allowance  our income tax expense increases in the period such determination is made 
if we decrease a valuation allowance  our income tax expense decreases in the period such determination is made 
tax contingencies we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
the audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in accordance with us gaap  to account for 
table of contents uncertainties in income taxes  we evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
us gaap requires that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where it is not more likely than not likelihood of greater than of being sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to a liability account for uncertain tax positions included in other liabilities to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand 
we also analyze sales levels by product type  including historical and estimated future customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate 
for example  we reserve for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product 
any adjustment to our inventory as a result of an estimated obsolescence or net realizable condition is reflected as a component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate  or market conditions or technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
contingent liabilities we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with us gaap 
in accordance with us gaap  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to 
table of contents these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
as additional information becomes available  we reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see also a discussion of specific contingencies in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
accruals for other liabilities we make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for our self funded medical insurance and general services  including legal fees  accounting fees and other expenses 
our liabilities contain uncertainties because we must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating our liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including interviewing our service providers for bills that have not yet been received 
for self insured liabilities  we estimate our liabilities based on historical claims experience 
if actual costs billed to us are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  our expenses could be understated or overstated and these adjustments could materially affect our net income
