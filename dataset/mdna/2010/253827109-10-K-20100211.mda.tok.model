overview we are a leading provider of diagnostic imaging products and personnel and equipment leasing services that improve patient care while driving positive healthcare economics 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are sold in a portable or a fixed configuration  and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras 
our nuclear cameras fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital 
we generate revenues within two primary operating segments our personnel and equipment leasing service business digirad imaging solutions  or dis and our product segment 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive personnel and equipment leasing services program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera or ultrasound machine for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging  echocardiography  vascular ultrasound  or any combination of these procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform imaging in the physician s office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis leasing service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
dis leasing services are primarily provided to cardiologists and internists who enter into annual contracts for personnel and equipment services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to three times per week 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to summer vacations  holidays and inclement weather  which historically has most negatively affected our third quarter 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and from the sale of camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals  and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 

table of contents our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of approximately  cardiologists   internists and family practitioners  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac and ultrasound procedures 
as of december   we have provided imaging services through dis to almost  physicians and physician groups and have sold cameras through our product segment 
we believe our market has been negatively affected by declining reimbursements from medicare and medicaid programs  pricing pressures  and continuing efforts by some third party payors to reduce healthcare expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications  or disallowing reimbursement if imaging is performed with portable or leased cameras 
we expect each of these trends to continue 
trends and drivers the medical device industry  including the market for nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services  is highly competitive 
our business continues to be negatively affected by many factors  including declining healthcare reimbursement rates for cardiac imaging procedures  competition from alternative imaging modalities such as ct angiography  and declining average selling prices for our product offerings 
according to industry sources  despite the improved image quality and increasing utilization rates of competing modalities such as computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  and magnetic resonance imaging mri  and diagnostic procedures such as ct angiography  spect procedures performed with gamma cameras will continue to be used for a substantial number of cardiac specific nuclear imaging procedures 
we believe continued utilization will be due to patients having easier access to nuclear medicine services at physicians offices  lower purchase and maintenance costs  a smaller physical footprint and easier service logistics of gamma cameras 
in an emerging trend in cardiology  spect technologies are being integrated with other imaging modalities  such as ct  to form hybrid imaging modalities  such as spect ct  resulting in improved clinical quality and diagnostic certainty 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include acceptance by physicians  qualification for reimbursement  pricing  ease of use  reliability and mobility 
in addition  we must maintain the technical leadership of our gamma cameras and must have an effective marketing and distribution strategy 
during  we achieved our goals in attaining profitability and positive cash flow despite a downturn in the economy  declines in reimbursement rates from federal healthcare programs  and a shortage of radiopharmaceuticals used in the leasing of equipment 
our consolidated operating profit increased by million to million in  and we increased our cash and investments in securities by million to million 
our achievements were the direct result of greater efficiencies created by selling or closing underperforming dis hub locations  flattening the management structure  and continuing our focus on creating more leverage from our centers of influence coi strategy  which pairs dis and leading academic or regional medical centers with community based physicians in locations with high potential for growth 
also saw the introduction of our new product the cardius x act camera 
this camera uses the cardius xpo solid state detectors with an x ray tube  and is setting a new clinical standard for cardiac spect with attenuation correction 
the x act approach exploits the high count rate capabilities of solid state detectors and takes advantage of the full inch wide triple head detector geometry to eliminate truncation in the attenuation scan 
the imaging system offers the benefits of high precision  faster speed and ultra low patient dose 
our x act systems have already been sold to a number of leading hospitals 
in  we will continue our focus on profitability and positive cash flow 
in the first quarter of  we restructured our dis organization into nine territories to provide greater autonomy and control over local sales and operations activities 
we expect this structure to offer greater efficiencies and adaptability to local market needs and conditions 
to offset expected reimbursement declines for cardiovascular imaging procedures in  we intend to implement new types of ultrasound equipment services that will expand our available product offerings in many of our service areas and increase the potential maximum daily patient volume 
in addition  we have developed more efficient ways to identify qualified potential customers from our coi strategy  which will enable us to further penetrate the available market 
in our product segment  we expect to introduce our products for sale and expand our market share by leveraging our growing installed base of satisfied cardius x act customers 

table of contents highlights our consolidated revenues were million during  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year  driven by a decrease in camera sales in our product segment as well as a decrease in imaging services revenue in our dis segment 
in the product segment  revenue decreased million  or  as a result of decreased gamma camera sales due in part to economic driven tightening of hospital capital budgets and limitations on the availability of credit for our traditional customer base 
dis revenue decreased million  or  primarily as a result of discontinuance of business in the hubs sold or closed in connection with our hub restructuring plan initiated in our dis business currently operates in states 
as of december   dis operated nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems  compared to nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems as of december  we believe we can improve our profitability by improving the utilization of our fleet of gamma cameras and ultrasound machines 
we measure efficiency by tracking system utilization  which is measured on the percentage of days that our nuclear and ultrasound imaging machines are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services 
system utilization increased to in  compared to in results of operations the following table sets forth our results from operations  expressed as percentages of total revenues for the years ended december   and revenues dis product total revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative amortization and impairment of intangible assets restructuring loss goodwill impairment loss total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net net income loss comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  as a result of lower product and dis revenues 
dis revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues for  compared to approximately for we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the decrease resulted from the sale or closure of underperforming locations in connection with the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by revenue increases from our current locations 
in the future  we expect dis revenue to fluctuate throughout the year based on seasonality stemming from physician vacations  holidays and inclement weather 
also  declines in reimbursement rates may substantially affect our dis revenue 
product 
our product revenue was million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of gamma cameras sold in to cameras compared to cameras sold in the prior year and the lowering of average sales prices as our product sales mix was represented by a larger percentage of refurbished cameras 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in maintenance contract revenues to million in from million in the prior year due to the expansion of our installed base of gamma cameras 
we believe that the decrease in gamma camera sales and the demand for refurbished cameras was due to the slowing economy  the reduction in available credit for potential buyers  lower levels of available capital budgets and the continued downward pressure on healthcare imaging reimbursement rates 
to offset continued pricing pressures and declines in reimbursement rates on our gamma cameras  we introduced our new cardius x act product in  which we believe will increase sales to the hospital market 

table of contents gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  which was essentially unchanged in comparison to the prior year  as the increased gross profits at our dis segment were offset by a decrease in gross profits at our product segment 
the increase in gross profit at our dis segment were due to the realignment of this segment initiated in the fourth quarter of  increased utilization of our dis assets and reduced personnel costs and other efficiency and cost improvements 
the decrease in product segment gross profit is principally the result of fewer camera sales  offset slightly by an increase in product maintenance contract gross profit 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from for dis 
cost of dis revenue consists primarily of labor  radiopharmaceuticals  equipment depreciation  and other costs associated with the provision of services 
cost of dis revenue was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in cost of dis revenue is primarily a result of decreased labor  radiopharmaceutical  and depreciation costs predominantly attributed to the increased utilization of our personnel and assets 
dis gross profit was million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for the improvement in operational performance is primarily associated with the realignment of the segment  which included the sale or closure of underperforming locations and a focus on selling within certain geographical areas  along with improved asset utilization 
product 
cost of product revenue primarily consists of materials  labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
cost of goods sold for the product segment was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year as fewer gamma cameras were sold and as our product sales mix was represented by a larger percentage of refurbished cameras 
product gross profit was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for  primarily due to the sale of proportionately more higher margin refurbished cameras and a decrease in personnel and manufacturing overhead costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses are the costs associated with the design  development and enhancement of our products  and consist of salaries  developmental materials  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees  and non recurring engineering costs 
we continue to invest in research and development with a focus on innovation as we seek to improve our existing technology 
in march  we received us food and drug administration k clearance for our new cardius x act imaging system 
research and development expenses were million for  which represents an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to higher personnel and development costs  as well as certain clinical evaluation costs related to our new cardius x act imaging system 
research and development expenses were of product revenue for compared to in  due to the lower camera sales and increased product development activity in we plan to invest further in our technology platform to penetrate new and existing market segments and attract new customers 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  travel  marketing  and collateral materials and tradeshow costs 
marketing and sales expenses were million for  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  principally as a result of lower personnel costs 
marketing and sales expenses were of total revenue for compared to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for accounting  human resources  information technology and executive personnel  legal related costs  professional fees  outside services  insurance  and costs related to our board of directors 
general and administrative expenses were million for  a decrease of million  or compared to the prior year  principally as a result of lower personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for compared to for 
table of contents restructuring loss 
restructuring loss declined from million in to million in to improve company profitability  we initiated restructuring plans in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of in  we reduced our workforce within both the product and dis segments in order to realign manufacturing and overhead expenses to a lower level of camera sales and to flatten the management structure 
to this end  the majority of the restructuring loss incurred in consisted of severance expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated plans to sell  close  and consolidate certain dis hub locations during the first quarter of in order to focus on hub locations that have stronger anticipated margin and growth potential 
these sales and closures involved the sale or abandonment of property and equipment and staff reductions at the hub locations impacted by the restructuring plans 
the majority of the restructuring loss incurred in consisted of a million loss on property and equipment 
goodwill impairment loss 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan in may resulted in the recording of goodwill 
among other assets  goodwill was recorded within a reporting unit in our dis segment on the date of the acquisition  and represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
during our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the assets held by the reporting unit  which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of million 
no impairment losses were recorded in other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of interest paid and other associated expenses 
the decrease in other income of million is attributable to a decrease in interest rates 
net income loss our net income was million for compared to a net loss of million for  an improvement of million  primarily as a result of increased dis segment gross profits and a reduction in our operating expenses 
the increase in dis gross profit is primarily due to decreased labor  radiopharmaceutical  depreciation  and maintenance costs 
the reduction in our operating expenses was primarily achieved through reduction of personnel costs and other restructuring initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of and the third quarter of comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year  driven by an increase in imaging services revenue in our dis segment  as well as increases in camera sales and maintenance contract revenues in our product segment 
dis revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues for  which is consistent with prior years 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributed to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ultrascan  a provider of ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices and hospitals  in may  which enabled us to generate revenue from ultrasound imaging services 
product 
our product revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of gamma cameras sold in to systems compared to sold in the prior year and an increase in maintenance contract revenues to million in from million in the prior year due to the expansion of our installed base of gamma cameras 
gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to an increase in costs of revenues in the dis segment 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for dis 
dis gross profit was million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  over the prior year  primarily due to the overall increase in labor  depreciation and other servicing costs 
depreciation costs increased due to our investment in the upgrade of our dis portable fleet  which was completed during the second quarter of our dis portable fleet consists primarily of cameras available for lease 
dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for product 
product gross profit increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in product sales 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for 
table of contents operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs 
research and development expenses were and of product revenue for and  respectively 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses were million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year  principally as a result of additional personnel costs  consistent with the increase in revenues in both the dis and product segments 
marketing and sales expenses were of total revenue for compared to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for  which was essentially unchanged compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for compared to for restructuring loss 
we initiated a restructuring plan to enhance company profitability in the fourth quarter of the initiatives included plans to sell  close  and consolidate certain dis hub locations during the first quarter of in order to focus on hubs that have stronger anticipated margin and growth potential 
these sales and closures involved the sale or abandonment of property and equipment and staff reductions at the hub locations impacted by the restructuring plans  as well as the reduction of certain management positions 
the loss on property and equipment makes up million of the million loss recorded in the remaining loss of million primarily represents severance payments 
no losses pertaining to restructuring efforts were recorded in the prior year 
goodwill impairment loss 
during our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the assets held by the reporting unit  which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of million 
no impairment losses were recorded in other income the decrease of million in other income reflects decreasing market yields and the lower levels of average cash and investments balances in compared to as a result of cash used to upgrade the dis fleet and acquire assets from ultrascan 
net loss our net loss increased to million for compared to a net loss of million for  primarily as a result of a significant increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses is due to a million goodwill impairment  million in restructuring losses and a million increase in marketing and sales expense 
furthermore  gross profit decreased by million primarily related to an increase in costs of revenues in the dis segment 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures and to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of dis nuclear cameras  ultrasound machines  vans  and computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current securities available for sale of million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  us treasury  government and corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe our working capital  together with cash flows from operating activities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations totaled million in due to cash flow from net income plus non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation 
net cash used by investing activities amounted to million in primarily for purchases of property and equipment and net purchases of securities available for sale 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to approximately million in  for the repurchase of common stock and repayment of capital lease obligations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our issued and outstanding common shares 
the timing of stock repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased have been and will be made in compliance with rule b under the securities exchange act of the timing and extent of the repurchase will depend upon market conditions  applicable legal and contractual requirements  and other factors 
through december   the company had repurchased stock with a value of approximately million 

table of contents the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan may require additional consideration of cash and common stock of up to million to be paid to the seller or its designees in the event that certain financial milestones are achieved over the next three years 
debt service as of december   we had capital lease obligations totaling less than million 
these obligations are secured by the specific equipment financed under each lease and will be repaid monthly over the lease terms  which range up to months 
our dis subsidiary entered these capital lease obligations 
we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from providing in office services to support the performance of cardiac imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met a contract or sales arrangement exists  products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition is based upon factors such as passage of title and risk of loss  the need for installation  and customer acceptance 
these factors are based on the specific terms of each contract or sales arrangement 
dis revenue is derived from the leasing of personnel and equipment for in office nuclear and ultrasound imaging procedures 
revenue related to the leasing of personnel and equipment is recognized at the time services are provided and collection is reasonably assured 
dis leasing services are generally billed on a per day basis under annual contracts  which specify the number of days of service to be provided  or on a flat rate month to month basis 
product revenues are generated from the sales of gamma cameras and follow on maintenance service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery to customers 
we also provide installation and training for camera sales in the united states 
installation and training is generally performed shortly after delivery and represents a relatively insignificant cost  which we accrue at the time revenue is recognized 
neither service is essential to the functionality of the product 
maintenance services are sold beyond the term of the warranty  which is generally one year from the date of purchase 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation and is included in product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
we review reserves on a quarterly basis and make adjustments based on our historical experience rate and known collectibility issues and disputes 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectibility could be impacted by material amounts due to changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
within dis  we record adjustments and credit memos that represent billing errors that are normally adjusted within the first days subsequent to the performance of service 
a provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and a provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as we only have a small number of customer accounts in both dis and product that have receivable balances in excess of  inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value and review our inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
we reserve of the cost of service inventory quantities in excess of a projected month demand 
in the third quarter of  we implemented several changes to the control and analysis of our inventory and we were able to obtain more accurate future demand information particularly in light of our product life cycles 
in conjunction with inventory projects  we physically segregated our production and service inventory and implemented new forecasting software 
as a result of these changes and our increased ability to obtain and better analyze information  we began reserving of the cost of production inventory quantities in excess of a projected month demand 
historically  we reserved of the cost of production inventory quantities in excess of a projected month demand 
the refinement of our reserve methodology did not result in the write up of inventory previously reserved and did not impact the comparability of the financial statements presented 
once inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold or disposed 
valuation of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
we record property and equipment at cost  and record other intangible assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
we calculate amortization on other intangible assets using either the accelerated or the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  based on the nature of when we expect to receive cash inflows generated by the intangible assets 
impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
we perform an annual review of the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including certain identifiable intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
long lived assets that are not used in operations and are actively being marketed for sale are classified as held for sale and are reflected as current assets on our balance sheet 
the values of these assets are reviewed quarterly and do not exceed the anticipated cash inflows generated from the sale of the assets 
valuation of goodwill on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ultrascan  inc ultrascan  a provider of ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices and hospitals 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded to goodwill in in  we recorded a million impairment loss in part due to a significant decline in our market capitalization 
we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill is million utilizing the discounted cash flow method under the income approach as well as the market approach  down from million in the impairment loss is included in loss from operations on our statement of operations 

table of contents restructuring restructuring costs are included in loss from operations on our income statement 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of losses on the abandonment of property and equipment and assets held for sale  one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  and obligations pertaining to abandoned property leases 
losses on property and equipment are recorded in accordance with our accounting policy related to long lived assets described above 
one time termination benefits are recorded at the time they are communicated to the affected employees 
losses on property lease obligations are recorded when the lease is abandoned 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock units rsus to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
we estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is based on the stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest are recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock options is derived using the following assumptions  some of which are subjective by nature 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes merton model for the year ended december  were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield 
the weighted average expected option term for   and reflects the application of the simplified method  which defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all options 
we utilized this approach as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical data for forfeitures and we are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
warranty we generally provide a month warranty on our gamma cameras 
we accrue the estimated cost of this warranty at the time revenue is recorded and charge warranty expense to product cost of revenues 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems covered by warranty 
warranty reserves are depleted as gamma cameras are repaired 
the costs consist principally of materials  personnel  overhead and transportation 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the return on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
