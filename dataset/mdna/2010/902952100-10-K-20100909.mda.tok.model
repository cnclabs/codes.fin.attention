recent trends in financial markets the deterioration of the global financial markets during the second half of and early resulted in considerable volatility within global credit and equity markets  which in turn had a significant negative impact on us global s assets under management  operating revenues and net income 
the company responded to these conditions by implementing cost reduction strategies 
us global remains debt free with considerable liquidity and financial resources that provide the company with flexibility to adapt to periods of market instability and turmoil 
the global equity markets began to improve in march  largely as a result of an aggressive and coordinated stimulus effort by major governments and central banks that injected the equivalent of several trillion dollars into credit markets to stimulate economic activity

equities linked to gold and broader natural resources  where most of the assets managed by us global investors are invested  were also volatile 
gold equities  as measured by the ftse gold mines index  began calendar with an percent drop by early february  then rose percent through mid may before slipping percent by the end of the fiscal year 
natural resources equities  as measured by the morgan stanley commodity related equity index  fell percent from the beginning of to early february  climbed percent by late april and then declined percent by june  given persistently high unemployment  weak housing markets and other headwinds  us economic growth prospects remain uncertain for the remainder of and into in spite of this uncertain operating period  us global has made progress with respect to investment performance of the funds  but remains cautious with its outlook on the financial markets 
business segments us global  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments 
first  the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and second  the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
for more details on the results of the company s core operations  see note financial information by business segment 
the company generates substantially all its operating revenues from the investment management of products and services for usgif and two offshore clients

as of june   the company held approximately million in investments  of which million  or of total assets  was invested in the funds and other offshore clients the company advises and million  or of total assets  in other entities 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services investment management revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
during fiscal year  average assets under management were billion  a modest increase of from the prior year 
average assets under management dollars in millions change change natural resource international equity fixed income domestic equity total sec registered funds other advisory clients average assets under management investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the company

as of june   and  the company held approximately million and million  respectively  in investments other than the clients the company advises 
investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair market value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
investments in securities classified as available for sale  which may not be readily marketable  are reflected as non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
investment income loss from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  realized foreign currency gains and losses  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
investment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations  the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities  and timing of transactions 
a significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers 
for fiscal years   and  the company had net recognized losses of approximately   and  respectively 
due to market volatility  the company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future

table of contents sec registered mutual fund investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets  ranging from to  and are paid monthly 
these advisory fees increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of increased assets under management in the natural resource funds as well as lower equity fund expense reimbursements resulting from the implementation of higher expense caps in october mutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  which include market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts  client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
the nine equity usgif funds include a base advisory fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by percent if there is a performance difference of percent or more between a fund s performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling months

timing of transactions and the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue

management believes current cash reserves  available financing  and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs or capital necessary for the above mentioned activities and allow the company to take advantage of investment opportunities whenever available 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while recent accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements  the company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments  income taxes  and valuation of stock based compensation 
investments 
the company accounts for its investments in securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities based on intent 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date 
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings 
investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost 
the company currently has no investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities 
investments classified as neither trading securities nor held to maturity securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from earnings  reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity  and recorded in earnings when realized 
the company evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary  the company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value  recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and a revised gaap cost basis for the security is established 
for available for sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income 
the company records security transactions on trade date 
realized gains or losses from security transactions are calculated on the first in first out cost basis  unless otherwise identifiable  and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
securities traded on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price 
securities for which over the counter market quotations are available  but for which there was no trade on or near the balance sheet date  are valued at the mean price between the last price bid and last price asked 
securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at management s estimate of fair value 
income taxes 
the company s annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its us and us entities which are part of the company s consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s consolidated tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises 
table of contents also create a difference between the tax rate used in the consolidated tax return and the effective tax rate in the company s consolidated income statement 
the company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc income taxes formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment is used to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
these liabilities are adjusted  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
judgment is used in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which reserves have been established are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
the company measured the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal and on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
no options were granted in fiscal the company believes that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s balance sheet includes assets whose fair value is subject to market risks 
due to the company s investments in equity securities  equity price fluctuations represent a market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or  if not actively traded  management s estimate of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices fluctuate  and the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from the reported market value 
the company s investment activities are reviewed and monitored by company compliance personnel  and various reports are provided to certain investment advisory clients 
written procedures are in place to manage compliance with the code of ethics and other policies affecting the company s investment practices 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of june   and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices 
estimated fair hypothetical value after increase decrease fair value at percentage hypothetical in shareholders june  change price change equity  net of tax trading securities  increase   decrease   available for sale  increase   decrease   unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the statement of operations 
unrealized and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders equity until realized 
the selected hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
results could be significantly different due to both the nature of equity markets and the concentration of the company s investment portfolio
