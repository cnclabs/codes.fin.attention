item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the state of delaware with operations in oklahoma  arkansas  texas and the gulf coast basin 
we seek to grow our production  proved reserves  cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration  development and acquisition activities 
from the commencement of our operations in through  we were focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
utilizing the cash flow generated by our higher margin gulf coast basin assets  we have successfully diversified into longer life basins in oklahoma  arkansas and texas through a combination of selective acquisitions and drilling activity 
beginning in with our acquisition of the carthage field in texas through  we have invested approximately million into growing our longer life assets 
during the six year period ended december   we have realized a drilling success rate on gross wells drilled 
comparing metrics with those in  the year we implemented our diversification strategy  we have grown production by and estimated proved reserves by 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves and of our production were derived from our longer life assets 
in response to declining commodity prices and the uncertain outlook on the financial markets as a result of the global financial crisis  during late we made the decision to shift our focus for from increasing production and reserves to building liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet 
as a result  we reduced our capital expenditures  including capitalized interest and overhead  by in from million in to million in in addition to reducing our capital expenditures  we also reduced our operating expenses and general and administrative costs  excluding non cash stock compensation expense  by a combined during as compared to finally  in june we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of these liquidity building efforts  we repaid million of bank debt in despite our reduction in capital expenditures  we were still able to increase production by and only experienced a decline in our estimated proved reserves  as compared to 
table of contents having achieved our goal of strengthening our balance sheet  we plan to resume our strategy of growing reserves and production during based upon our outlook for commodity prices 
we plan to fund our estimated capital expenditures budget of million through internally generated cash flow 
we expect to operate the majority of our drilling activity in which should enable us to respond timely to global market changes and commodity price changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
on december   the sec issued a revision to staff accounting bulletin sab which established guidelines related to modernizing accounting and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies 
the revised disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the revised rules also allow companies the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the existing requirement to disclose proved reserves 
the revised disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates 
a significant change to the rules involves the pricing at which reserves are measured 
the revised rules utilize a month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the month period prior to the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves rather than year end prices 
in addition  the month average will also be used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the revised rules are effective for reserve estimation at december  with first reporting for calendar year companies in their annual reports 
see items and business and properties oil and gas reserves for a discussion of the impact of this change in methodology on our estimated proved reserves 
full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 

table of contents the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges in place  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
natural gas prices have declined significantly since june of at december   we computed the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at  using twelve month average prices  including hedges  of per mcfe and per barrel 
due to the low twelve month average prices  we recorded a ceiling test write down of million during the fourth quarter of our cash flow hedges in place at december  reduced the fourth quarter ceiling test write down by approximately million 
in total  we recorded million in ceiling test write downs during given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices continue to decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that additional write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 

table of contents our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future nymex prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third party s valuation model that utilizes market corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract 
our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 generally accepted accounting principles asc topic which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc as the official single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all existing accounting standards are superseded 
all other accounting guidance not included in the codification is considered non authoritative 
the codification is not intended to change gaap  but it will change the way gaap is organized and presented 
the codification was effective for our third quarter financial statements and the principal impact on our financial statements is limited to disclosures therein as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the codification 
in order to ease the transition to the codification  we are providing cross references to the standards issued and adopted prior to the adoption alongside the codification references 
effective january   we adopted asc topic sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
asc topic requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities  and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the adoption of asc topic had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective january   we adopted asc topic fsp 
asc topic provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share using the two class method described in asc topic sfas 
see note regarding the impact of the adoption on our calculation of earnings per share 
in april  the fasb issued asc topic fsp fas and asc topic apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments which enhance consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures 
these standards are effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  and we adopted the provisions of these standards for the period ending june  the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted asc topic sfas no 
 subsequent events in the second quarter of asc topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
although there is new terminology  the standard is based on the same principles as those that previously existed 
asc topic includes a new required disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
the adoption of asc topic did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
year ended december  production oil bbls gas mcfe total production mcfe sales total oil sales total gas sales total oil and gas sales average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcfe per mcfe the above sales and average sales prices include increases reductions to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   and  and oil hedges of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in the net loss during was primarily attributable to the following production gas production during the twelve month period ended december  increased from the comparable period in the increase in gas production was primarily the result of a full year of production from discoveries at our pelican point and the bluffs prospects in south louisiana and increased production from our oklahoma and arkansas wells 
oil production during the year ended december  decreased from the comparable period primarily due to normal production declines at our ship shoal and turtle bayou fields which produce approximately half of our total oil production 
while production increased overall by in  we experienced declines in each quarter throughout as a result of our reduced capital expenditures 
our capital expenditure budget for is significantly increased  which we expect will provide us with quarterly production growth in  as compared to our fourth quarter production 
however  in total  we expect production to be slightly less than volumes produced during prices including the effects of our hedges  average oil prices per barrel during were  as compared to during average gas prices per mcf were during  as compared to during stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the impact of oil and gas prices on our revenues  cash flow and bank credit facility 
revenue including the  received from our hedges  oil and gas sales during the year ended december  totaled  a decrease from oil and gas sales of  during the decreased revenue during was primarily the result of lower average pricing and decreased oil production 
as a result of the expiration of our higher valued hedge positions  we expect oil and gas revenue to decline during  as compared to 
table of contents expenses lease operating expenses for year ended december  decreased to  from  during per unit lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe during the decreases in lease operating expenses were primarily due to the decline in costs of services and materials in the markets in which we operate as the demand for such materials and services has weakened as a result of the decline in commodity prices and the overall condition of the oil and gas industry and the global economy 
we expect that lease operating expenses during will approximate those in production taxes totaled  and  during and  respectively 
production taxes decreased in for the following reasons 
during the third quarter of  we filed for a production tax refund in the amount of  at our pelican point prospect as the well qualified for a deep well severance tax exemption for a period of months from the initial production date of may in addition  we received a production tax refund of  during the second quarter of related to certain of our horizontal wells in oklahoma that qualify for a month production tax exemption 
finally  the impact of lower commodity prices realized for the production from our oklahoma  arkansas and texas properties contributed to the decline in production taxes during the period 
partially offsetting these decreases was a increase in the louisiana gas severance tax rate effective july  because we do not anticipate receiving the same level of production tax refunds in as we did in  we expect production taxes to increase 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during included in general and administrative expenses was share based compensation expense related to asc topic sfas r share based payment  as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation we capitalized  of general and administrative costs during the twelve month period ended december  and  during the comparable period 
the decline in general and administrative expenses during was  in part  due to lower non cash share based compensation 
in addition  during may  we incurred compensation expense of approximately million  or approximately million net of capitalization  related to our election to pay employee taxes on the vesting of certain restricted stock grants 
no similar expense was incurred during we expect that general and administrative expenses will approximate those in the price of natural gas used in computing our estimated proved reserves during had a negative impact on our estimated proved reserves from certain of our longer life properties and reduced the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves 
as a result  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  see note  ceiling test for further discussion of the ceiling test write downs 
by comparison  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe during the decline in our dd a per mcfe was the result of the ceiling test write downs of a substantial portion of our proved oil and gas properties during and the fourth quarter of as a result of lower commodity prices 
we expect dd a to be lower in as a result of ceiling test write downs in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during as compared to  during we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during the year ended is due to the increase in our bank debt outstanding during the first nine months of as compared to the first nine months of during the second half of  we repaid a total of million of bank borrowings 
as a result of this repayment and our expectation that we will fund our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations  we expect interest in to be lower than other expense during includes  related to payments made in connection with a drilling rig contract 
as a result of the significant decline in natural gas prices  we elected to idle this drilling rig 
because there are no corresponding assets to record in connection with the fixed payments required under this contract  regardless of actual rig usage  the costs are recorded as a component of other expense 
this contract expired during july no similar expense was incurred during 
table of contents additionally  other expense during included  related to drill pipe inventory which was impaired to reflect the lower of cost or market 
income tax benefit during totaled  as compared to  during we typically provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs  we have incurred a cumulative three year loss 
as a result of this cumulative loss and the impact it has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we established a valuation allowance of million as of december  the impact of this valuation allowance is included in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  our effective tax rate in future periods will be impacted by future adjustments to the valuation allowance 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in net income during was primarily attributable to the following production during september  the majority of our gulf coast basin properties were impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike and we estimate that approximately bcfe  which would have been produced during the third and fourth quarters of  was shut in and deferred as a result of the storms 
oil production during the year ended december  decreased from primarily due to normal production declines at our ship shoal and turtle bayou fields  which provided approximately one half of our total oil production 
hurricane shut in time also contributed to the decline in oil production 
during late  we began drilling operations on our arkansas acreage 
as a result of production from this new basin and our continued drilling success in longer life basins  where the production is primarily natural gas  our gas production during increased from the year ended december  the increase in gas production during was partially offset by the downtime we experienced as a result of the hurricanes 
overall  production during was higher than in prices including the effects of our hedges  average oil prices per barrel during were  as compared to during average gas prices per mcf were during  as compared to during stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during  however  oil and gas prices declined significantly during the third and fourth quarters of revenue oil and gas sales during the year ended december  totaled  a increase from oil and gas sales of  during the increased revenue during was primarily the result of higher average pricing and increased gas production 
during  we sold the majority of our gas gathering assets located in oklahoma for net proceeds of  and recorded a  gain 
proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of our bank borrowings 
expenses lease operating expenses during increased to  as compared to  during on a unit of production basis  operating expenses totaled per mcfe and per mcfe during and  respectively 
the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to the overall increase in the cost of materials  transportation  fuel and other services during as compared to production taxes totaled  and  during and  respectively 
the increase in production taxes is primarily due to higher average prices and increased production from our oklahoma  arkansas and texas properties 
additionally  there was a increase in the louisiana gas severance tax rate effective july  
table of contents general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during included in general and administrative expenses was share based compensation expense relative to asc topic sfas r share based payment as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation excluding share based compensation  general and administrative expenses during increased by  as compared to employee related costs  including our payment of employee taxes for the vesting of certain restricted stock grants  represented the majority of the increase in expenses during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe during the increase in dd a expense during was primarily due to the higher cost of drilling and completion operations during  as compared to  and the negative impact that declining oil and gas prices had on our proved reserves at september  and december  the prices of oil and natural gas used in computing our estimated proved reserves at september  and december  were substantially below the market prices received during the majority of the lower oil and natural gas prices had a negative impact on our proved reserves from certain of our longer life properties and reduced the estimated discounted cash flow from our proved reserves 
as a result  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during as compared to  during we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
the increase in the capitalized portion of our interest cost during was due to the increase in our unevaluated properties  which is primarily the result of leasehold acquisitions made in our longer life basins 
income tax expense benefit during totaled  as compared to  during the decrease during is primarily the result of the impact of ceiling test write downs  offset in part by the gain on the sale of our gas gathering assets 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and sales of assets 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million compared to a surplus of million at december  during  our cash flow from operations in excess of our significantly reduced capital expenditures and the proceeds from our common stock offering in june were used to repay million in outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and reduce our short term liabilities  primarily our accounts payable to vendors 
these uses of working capital  along with the decline in our hedge asset  resulted in a million reduction to working capital as of december  as compared to december  prices for oil and natural gas are subject to many factors beyond our control such as weather  the overall condition of the global financial markets and economies  relatively minor changes in the outlook of supply and demand  and the actions of opec 
oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
lower prices and reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  including under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
see source of capital debt below 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as oil and natural gas prices 

table of contents source of capital operations net cash flow from operations decreased from  in to  during the decrease in operating cash flow during was primarily attributable to the impact of lower commodity prices and the timing of payments made to reduce our accounts payable to vendors 
source of capital debt during  we issued million in principal amount of our senior notes due the notes  which have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on may and november at december   million had been accrued in connection with the may  interest payment and we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the notes 
on october   we entered into the credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  calyon new york branch  bank of america  na  wells fargo bank  na  and whitney national bank 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit agreement matures on february   provided  however  if on or prior to such date we prepay or refinance  subject to certain conditions  the notes  the maturity date will be extended to october  we had million and million of borrowings outstanding as of december  and february   respectively  under and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is based upon the valuation as of january and july of each year of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas properties 
the current borrowing base  which was based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas property as of july   is million 
the next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to occur by march  we or the lenders may request two additional borrowing base redeterminations each year 
each time the borrowing base is to be redetermined  the administrative agent under the credit agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion  which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is to be increased  or by lenders holding two thirds of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced 
the indenture governing the notes also limits our ability to incur indebtedness under the credit agreement 
under the indenture  we will not be able to incur additional secured indebtedness under the credit agreement if at the time of such incurrence  the total amount of indebtedness under the credit agreement is in excess of the greater of i million and ii of our actna as defined in the indenture 
that calculation is based primarily on the valuation of our estimated reserves of oil and natural gas using month average commodity prices 
based on the million of borrowings outstanding on february   the indenture limits our additional borrowings under the credit agreement to million 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including a lien on all equipment and at least of the aggregate total value of our oil and gas properties 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate abr plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage or the adjusted libo rate eurodollar plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the alternate base rate is equal to the highest of i the jpmorgan chase prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii the adjusted libo rate plus 
for the purposes of the definition of alternative base rate only  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which dollar deposits of  with a one month maturity are offered by the principal london office of jpmorgan chase bank  na in immediately available funds in the london interbank market 
for all other purposes  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market for one  two  three or six months as selected by us are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities 
outstanding letters of credit are charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to eurodollar loans  a fronting fee and customary administrative fees 
in addition  we pay commitment fees of 

table of contents we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit agreement  including a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt  liens  dividends  distributions and redemptions  investments  loans and advances  nature of business  international operations and foreign subsidiaries  leases  sale or discount of receivables  mergers or consolidations  sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  negative pledge agreements  gas imbalances and swap agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement 
source of capital issuance of securities on june   we received net proceeds of approximately million through the public offering of million shares of our common stock  which included the issuance of million shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
during april  we filed a universal shelf registration statement to replace our previous registration statement  which was scheduled to expire in april this replacement registration statement  which was declared effective in july  allows us to publicly offer and sell up to million of any combination of debt securities  shares of common and preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continually evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects 
in october  we sold a small interest in certain of our oklahoma assets for approximately million in cash 
in addition  the purchasers of that interest have agreed to pay a disproportionate share of all capital expenditures in oklahoma for the next three years 
in may  we sold certain of our east texas oil and gas properties for approximately million 
in  we sold the majority of our gas gathering systems located in oklahoma for million 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future 
use of capital exploration and development our capital budget  which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
this represents an approximately increase from capital spending realized in we plan to continue our strategic focus of funding our drilling expenditures with cash flow from operations 
because we operate the majority of our proved reserves  we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments 
as a result of this flexibility  we plan to actively manage our capital budget to stay within our projected cash flow from operations  based upon our expectations of commodity prices  production rates and capital costs 
however  if commodity prices decline or if actual production or costs vary significantly from our expectations  our exploration and development activities could be reduced or could require additional financings  which may include sales of equity or debt securities  sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to further delay  reduce our participation in or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total senior notes bank debt operating leases capital projects total includes principal and estimated interest 
consists primarily of leases for office space and office equipment 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our oil and gas properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we expect to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received approximately million from the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
our credit agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under the credit agreement or  if not a lender under the credit agreement  rated a a or higher by s p or moody s
