item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which we refer to as md a  of cenveo  inc and its subsidiaries  which we refer to as cenveo  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  which we refer to as the form k 
certain statements we make under this item constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in item and risk factors in item a 
introduction and executive overview we are one of the largest diversified printing companies in north america  according to the december printing impressions report 
our broad portfolio of products includes forms and labels manufacturing  packaging and publisher offerings  envelope production and commercial printing 
we operate a global network of strategically located printing and manufacturing  fulfillment and distribution facilities  which we refer to as manufacturing facilities  serving a diverse base of over  customers 
since  when current senior management joined the company  we have significantly improved profitability by consolidating and closing plants  centralizing and leveraging our purchasing spend  seeking operational efficiencies  and reducing corporate and field staff 
in addition  we have made investments in our businesses through acquisitions of highly complementary companies and capital expenditures  while also divesting non strategic businesses 
our management team is primarily focused on two main areas affecting our business i printing industry challenges  primarily pricing pressures experienced throughout our operations and overcapacity in certain of the markets that we operate in  and ii financial flexibility  which includes servicing our current debt level  investing in our business through strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures  and increasing our economies of scale to help improve the performance of our current operations 
the united states printing industry is highly fragmented  with a broad range of sectors  including commercial printing and labels  envelopes and forms among others 
we believe the printing industry has excess capacity and continues to be highly competitive with many of our customers focusing on price as a key decision driver 
we believe that given the current economic downturn  our customers will continue to focus on price 
we continue to pursue cost savings measures in an effort to align our cost structure with our anticipated revenues and mitigate the impact of pricing pressures 
such measures could require additional plant closures and or consolidation and employee headcount reductions throughout our operating platform 
our financial flexibility depends heavily on our ability to maintain relationships with existing customers  attract new financially viable customers and maximize our operating profits  all of which are vital to our ability to service our current debt level 
our level of indebtedness  which requires significant principal and interest payments  could potentially impact our ability to reinvest cash flows from operations into our business via capital expenditures or niche acquisitions 
we therefore closely monitor working capital  including the credit we extend to and the collections we receive from customers  inventory levels  and vendor pricing and sales terms  while continuously seeking improvements to increase our cash flow 
we offer our customers a wide range of print products and certain of our key customers have recently provided us the opportunity to become a single source supplier for all of their printed product needs 
this trend benefits our customers as they seek to leverage their buying power and helps us improve operating efficiencies in our plants with increased throughput 
we believe that our manufacturing platform  strategically located facilities and our industry experienced management team will enable us to improve our operating margins 
we also continue to work with our vendors and focus on supply chain enhancements to lower our input costs and improve our operating margins 
see part item of this form k for a more complete description of our business 
outlook the current us and global economic conditions have affected and  most likely  will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position 
these uncertainties about future economic conditions in a very challenging environment make it difficult for us to forecast our future operating results 
one critical success factor for us is maintaining our reputation for reliability  quality and superior customer service 
this is vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones 
at the same time  we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies 
in the second half of and the first two months of  we saw several developments that we anticipate impacting our business in these developments include  but are not limited to i raw material price increases for some of our key manufacturing inputs  and ii increased unit volume for our direct mail envelope customers  primarily financial institutions  during the fourth quarter of as compared to the first half of our ability to pass on raw material price increases over time to our customers should limit the impact of the manufacturing input price increases on our operating results  while direct mailers returning to market in should allow our envelope operations to capitalize on capacity reductions and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from our plan 
we anticipate the economic environment currently influencing our operations to continue through the first half of therefore  we will continue our pursuit of additional cost savings opportunities in an effort to mitigate the impacts of the current economic environment 
in  we are focused on completing the integration of nashua into our existing manufacturing platform and believe that expected synergies resulting from the nashua acquisition will be available to us for a substantial portion of the year 
in january of  we announced the closure of nashua s omaha  nebraska labels facility and we are currently integrating it into our existing operations 
in addition  cost savings actions that we began in the first quarter of  as part of our plan  which we continued implementing throughout our fiscal year  should increase our profitability in we anticipate our net sales in to increase compared to  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of nashua s operations in our results  increased unit volumes in our envelope reporting unit and raw material price increases being passed onto our customers in certain of our businesses 
in february of  we completed a refinancing that included an amendment  which we refer to as the amendment  to our revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and our term loans and delayed draw term loans due  which we refer to as the term loans  which collectively with the revolving credit facility we refer to as the amended credit facilities  and the issuance of million senior second lien notes due  which we refer to as the notes 
this refinancing extended maturities on approximately one quarter of our total debt and provides immediate financial flexibility with the elimination of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we currently anticipate net capital expenditures to be relatively consistent with our net capital expenditures 
our cash taxes are expected to be minimal given our level of net operating loss carryfowards while we expect cash interest to increase as a result of our amendment and issuance of our notes 
our pension and other postretirement plan expenses and expected contributions related to our pension and other postretirement plans will increase slightly in  primarily due to the nashua acquisition  offset in part by the investment return on plan assets in we regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with businesses that could complement or strengthen our existing product categories and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
consolidated operating results this md a includes an overview of our consolidated results of operations for  and followed by a discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments for the same period 
our results of operations for the year ended january  include the operating results of nashua subsequent to its acquisition date of september  our results of operations for the year ended january  include the operating results of rex  subsequent to its acquisition date on march  our results of operations for the year ended december  include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates  except for colorgraphics which was included in our operating results from july our results for the year ended january   reflect the unfavorable economic conditions we and our customers encountered in excluding the effects of our acquisitions in and  net sales decreased 
our commercial printing segment results were primarily influenced by volume and price declines in substantially all of the markets we serve due to excess capacity and intense pricing pressures 
our envelope  forms and labels segment also experienced price and volume declines primarily attributable to our financial services customers who historically reached targeted customers via our direct mail capabilities 
in order to compete effectively in this environment  we continue to focus on improving productivity and creating operating efficiencies through cost reductions 
for example  in  we reduced our employee headcount by approximately  and closed and consolidated nine manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we continued pursuing working capital initiatives to increase cash flow generation from operations despite the decline in our net sales 
a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is presented below 
the summary presents reported net sales and operating income loss 
see segment operations below for a summary of net sales and operating income loss of our operating segments that we use internally to assess our operating performance

we refer to such periods herein as i the year ended january  or  ii the year ended january  or and iii the year ended december  or all references to years and year ends herein relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years 
we do not believe the additional week in had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations

these decreases were largely due to volume declines  changes in product mix and lower material costs  primarily due to the current general economic conditions that we experienced during  and lost sales resulting from plant closures as part of our restructuring plans 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results in net sales for increased million  as compared to this increase was primarily due to the million of sales generated from the integration of rex and the acquisitions into our operations  for which rex was not included in our results in  and the acquisitions were included in our results for less than a full year in this increase was partially offset by lower sales from our commercial printing and envelopes  forms and labels segments of million and million  respectively  primarily due to plant closures and lower volumes due to general economic conditions  partially offset by price increases net of changes in product mix 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for our net sales changes 
operating income operating income  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million for our commercial print and envelope reporting units  decreased million in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower operating income for our envelopes  forms and labels segment of million and our commercial printing segment of million 
these declines were primarily due to the current general economic conditions that we experienced during and increased restructuring and impairment charges resulting from cost savings initiatives taken to mitigate the current general economic conditions 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment 
operating income for decreased million  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to i increased restructuring  impairment and other charges of million  primarily relating to non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our commercial print and envelope reporting units  and ii higher selling  general and administrative expenses of million primarily due to the acquisition of rex in  for which rex was not included in our results in  and the acquisitions  which were not included in our results for a full year in  offset in part by our cost savings programs 
these decreases were partially offset by i increased gross margins of million primarily due to the acquisition of rex  for which rex was not included in our results in  and the acquisitions  which were not included in our results for a full year in and our cost savings programs  offset in part by higher manufacturing costs primarily due to material price increases and higher distribution costs and lower gross margins due to plant closures  and ii lower amortization of million 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to our lower debt balances resulting from i the repurchase and retirement of a portion of our senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and ii the repayment of a portion of term loans  primarily from a mandatory excess cash flow payment made in march and other debt 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest rates resulting from the april amendment of our amended credit facilities  which we refer to as the amendment 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  compared to the average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of in we expect interest expense in to be higher than largely due to the amendment and the issuance of our notes 
interest expense increased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional debt incurred to finance rex and the acquisitions  offset in part by lower interest rates 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  compared to the average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of in gain loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in  we recognized net gains on early extinguishment of debt of million  comprising of gains of million from the repurchase and retirement of principal amounts of million of our notes  million of our notes  and million of our notes 
these gains were partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of million  of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in  we i repurchased million of our notes and million of our notes  and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million  and ii converted our million senior unsecured loan due  which we refer to as the senior unsecured loan  into our notes  and recognized a million loss on early extinguishment debt 
in  we i retired the remaining million of our senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  ii executed a tender offer for repayment on march  of million of our notes  and iii refinanced our then existing million senior secured credit facilities  which we refer to as the credit facilities  in connection with the cadmus acquisition  for which we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of million 
income taxes years ended january  january  december  in thousands income tax expense benefit for us operations income tax expense benefit for foreign operations income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily relates to the tax benefit on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to non deductible expenses  offset in part by state tax benefits 
the non deductible expenses primarily relate to stock based compensation expense resulting from a difference in tax deductions available to us based on the market price of our stock based compensation at the time of exercise as compared to our recorded stock based compensation expense 
if we generated pre tax income  this would cause our effective income tax rate to be higher than our statutory federal rate 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  income taxes  record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered our recent operating results and anticipated future taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
the company s valuation allowance was reduced in by million  which primarily consisted of a million reduction related to our uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded related to the deferred tax assets acquired in the nashua transaction of million 
there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months we may decrease our liability for uncertain tax positions by approximately million due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily relates to the million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the non cash goodwill impairment charges  offset in part by taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment charges  offset in part by state tax benefits 
the non deductible goodwill impairment charges accounted for a reduction to the effective tax benefit rate of approximately 
in  we had income tax expense of million  which primarily relates to taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax rate in was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to release of valuation allowances 
see the critical accounting matters section of this md a

income from discontinued operations for primarily relates to the reduction of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the supremex income fund  which we refer to as the fund 
income from discontinued operations for includes the million gain on sale of our remaining interest in the fund  on march   net of taxes of million  and equity income related to our retained interest in the fund from january  through march  segment operations our chief executive officer monitors the performance of the ongoing operations of our two reportable segments

envelopes  forms and labels years ended january  january  december  in thousands segment net sales segment operating income loss operating income loss margin items included in segment operating income restructuring and impairment charges net sales segment net sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment decreased million  or  in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to i lower sales volume of million  primarily due to the current general economic conditions which has had a significant impact on our envelope business  for which we have seen a shift from direct mail and customized envelopes to generic transactional envelopes and lost sales in connection with the closure of three envelope plants and one forms plant that were integrated into our existing envelope operations  and ii lower pricing and product mix of million  primarily due to pricing pressures in the current envelope marketplace and lower material costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased sales from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results in segment net sales for our envelopes  forms and labels segment increased million  or in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i the million of sales generated from the integration of commercial envelope and printegra into our operations in  including the impact of sales changes for work transitioned into these acquired operations from other legacy plants  as printegra and commercial envelope were not included in our results for a full year in  and ii higher sales of approximately million  primarily due to material price increases that have historically been passed onto our customers  net of changes in product mix 
this increase was offset in part by lower sales volume of approximately million  primarily due to general economic conditions which have had a significant impact on our envelope  forms and labels business and the closing of plants in connection with the integration of printegra and commercial envelope into our operations 
segment operating income segment operating income for our envelopes  forms and labels segment  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  decreased million or in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to i lower gross margins of million  primarily due to the current general economic conditions  which has resulted in increased pricing pressures  lower sales volume and product mix changes from high color direct mail envelopes to transactional envelope products  partially offset by lower material costs and increased gross margins from nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for  and ii increased restructuring and impairment charges  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  of million  primarily due to the closure of three envelope plants and one forms plant

these decreases were partially offset by increased gross margins of million primarily due to the acquisition of commercial envelope and printegra  which were not included in our results for a full year in  and our cost savings programs  offset in part by higher material costs primarily due to material price increases and higher distribution costs 
commercial printing years ended january  january  december  in thousands segment net sales segment operating income loss operating income loss margin items included in segment operating income restructuring and impairment charges net sales segment net sales for our commercial printing segment decreased million  or  in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the current general economic conditions  which resulted in lower sales of i million related to volume declines and lost sales from the closure of two commercial printing plants in the first half of and ii million resulting from increased pricing pressures  changes in product mix and lower material costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of million from the integration of rex into our operations  as rex was not included in our results for a full year in net sales for our commercial printing segment increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to the million of sales generated from the integration of rex  colorgraphics and cadmus into our operations in  including the impact of sales changes for work transitioned into these acquired operations from other legacy plants  including two plants we closed in  as rex was not included in our results in and cadmus and colorgraphics were not included in our results for a full year in this increase was partially offset by lower sales of approximately i million resulting from other plant closures in  and ii million resulting from pricing pressures  volume declines  and changes in product mix  primarily due to the general economic conditions  and foreign currency fluctuations  offset in part by higher sales due to material price increases

these decreases were offset in part by lower amortization expense of million 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses include the costs of running our corporate headquarters 
corporate expenses were lower in  as compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense 
corporate expenses were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to increased stock based compensation  and the million non recurring charge incurred for professional fees in connection with the internal review conducted by our audit committee  offset in part by other lower net costs 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
in the first quarter of  we implemented the plan  to reduce our operating costs and realign our manufacturing platform in order to compete effectively during the current economic downturn 
upon the acquisition of nashua  we developed and implemented our plan to integrate nashua into our existing operations  which we refer to as the nashua plan 
in the fourth quarter of  such activities related to the nashua plan  included the closure and consolidation of nashua s vernon  california point of sale facility into our existing los angeles  california envelope facility  elimination of duplicative headcount and public company costs 
as a result of these two plans  in  we implemented cost saving initiatives throughout our business  including the closure of nine manufacturing facilities and integrated them into existing operations and a reduction in headcount of approximately  we are pursuing additional cost savings opportunities in an effort to mitigate the impacts of the current economic conditions and to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our estimated net sales 
we anticipate being substantially complete with the implementation of these cost savings initiatives in the first quarter of in  we continued our plan and completed the integration of the acquisitions into our operations 
as a result of actions taken under this plan  we closed seven manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount by approximately  in the fourth quarter  we completed our plan  which among other things  included consolidating our purchasing activities and manufacturing platform with the closure of two manufacturing facilities in that were integrated into existing operations  reducing corporate and field human resources  streamlining our information technology infrastructure and eliminating discretionary spending 
as of january   our total restructuring liability was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities and million  which is expected to be paid through  is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we anticipate lower restructuring and impairment charges in during  in connection with both the plan and nashua plan  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairment charges  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  pension withdrawal expense of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
during  we incurred million of restructuring  impairment and other charges  which included non cash goodwill impairment charges of million  a million non recurring charge for professional fees related to the internal review initiated by our audit committee  million of employee separation costs  asset impairment charges  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  pension withdrawal income of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
during the fourth quarter of  our reporting units experienced declines in their net sales  gross profit and operating income on a comparable basis with the third quarter of historically  the fourth quarter has been our strongest quarter for net sales  gross profit and operating income for our reporting units 
these declines primarily resulted from reduced sales volume across our business platform due to the effects of the current economic downturn that exacerbated in late  as our customers began reducing their print related spend and pricing pressure that intensified from competitors who began pricing print work at or below breakeven levels 
as a result of these volume declines  we lowered our estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units 
during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  million of asset impairment charges  net  equipment moving expenses of million  a pension withdrawal liability of million  lease termination expenses of million  and building clean up and other expenses of million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and a decrease in our working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital primarily resulted from a reduction in inventories due to the timing of work performed for our customers and a decrease in receivables due to lower sales volume and the timing of collections from and sales to our customers  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to lower sales volume and the timing of payments to our vendors and accrued compensation liabilities primarily due to lower employee headcount 
cash provided by operating activities is generally sufficient to meet our daily disbursement needs 
on days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements  we historically reduced our revolving credit facility balance or placed excess funds in conservative  short term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt 
on days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts  we used our invested cash balance and or our revolving credit facility to fund the difference 
as a result  our daily revolving credit facility loan balance fluctuated depending on working capital needs 
the amendment along with the issuance of our notes resulted in the elimination of nearly all of our revolving credit facility balances and thereby substantially increasing our liquidity position  which may cause us to modify what we do with accumulating cash in the future 
regardless  at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and a source of cash from a decrease in our working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in receivables  primarily due to the timing of collections from our customers and lower sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily from capital expenditures of million and cost of business acquisitions of million for nashua  offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment and million of proceeds from the sale of an investment 
our debt agreements limit capital expenditures to million in plus any unused permitted amounts from we estimate that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  before considering proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our primary sources for our capital expenditures are cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  and financing capacity within our current debt arrangements 
these sources of funding are consistent with prior years funding of our capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from capital expenditures of million and the cost of business acquisitions of million  primarily for rex  offset in part by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily resulting from i aggregate payments of million related to the repurchase and retirement of million  million and million of our notes  notes and notes  respectively  ii the repayment of million of term loans  primarily related to our march mandatory excess cash flow requirement under our amended credit facilities  iii the repayment of million of other long term debt  and iv the payment of million in fees and expenses for the amendment  offset in part by the proceeds of net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily resulting from the conversion of the senior unsecured loan  net repayments under our revolving credit facility of million  repurchases of million of our notes  payments of our other long term debt of million  repurchases of million of our notes  repayments of our term loans of million and million for the payment of debt issuance costs on the issuance of our notes  offset in part by the proceeds from the issuance of our million notes and million of borrowings of other long term debt 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table details our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of january  in thousands payments due long term debt operating leases other total thereafter total includes million of estimated interest expense over the term of our long term debt  with variable rate debt having an average interest rate of approximately 
includes pension and other postretirement contributions of million  anticipated worker s compensation paid losses of million  restructuring related liabilities of million  including interest expense on lease terminations  income tax contingencies of million  derivative liabilities of million  and purchase commitments for equipment of million 
excluded from the table are million income tax contingencies as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount payable or timing of settlement 
long term debt 
our total outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately billion as of january   a decrease of million from january  this decrease was primarily due to i the open market repurchase and retirement of aggregate principal amounts of million of our notes  notes and notes during  and ii paying down our debt with cash flows provided by operating activities 
the open market purchases were made within permitted restricted payment limits under our debt agreements at the time of purchase  however  potential future open market purchases will be restricted for some time as a result of the amendment 
as of january   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed interest rates 
see the remainder of this long term debt section that follows 
as of march   we had million borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
amended credit facilities and debt compliance our amended credit facilities  which are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  contain  prior to the amendment  two financial covenants that must be complied with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  which we refer to as the leverage covenant  and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  which we refer to as the interest coverage covenant 
on april   we completed the amendment which included  among other things  modifications to the leverage covenant and the interest coverage covenant 
the leverage covenant  with which we must be in pro forma compliance at all times  was increased to through march   and then proceeds to step down through the end of the term of the amended credit facilities 
the interest coverage covenant  with which we must be in pro forma compliance on a quarterly basis  was reduced to through december   and then proceeds to step up through the end of the term of the amended credit facilities 
additionally  the calculations of these two financial covenants have been modified to permit the adding back of certain amounts 
we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants as of january  as conditions to the amendment  we agreed  among other things  to increase the pricing on all outstanding revolving credit facility balances and term loans to include interest at the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  depending on the quarterly leverage covenant calculation then in effect 
previously  the revolving credit facility s borrowing spread over libor ranged from basis points to basis points based upon the leverage covenant calculation  and the borrowing spread over libor for the term loans was basis points 
further  the amendment i reduced the revolving credit facility from million to million  ii increased the unfunded commitment fee paid to revolving credit lenders from basis points to basis points  iii eliminated our ability to request a million incremental term loan facility  iv limited new senior unsecured debt and debt assumed from acquisitions to million while the leverage covenant calculation is above  v eliminated the restricted payments basket while the leverage covenant calculation exceeds certain thresholds  vi required that certain additional financial information be delivered  vii lowered the annual amount that can be spent on capital expenditures to million in  and viii increased certain mandatory prepayments 
an amendment fee of basis points was paid to all consenting lenders who approved the amendment 
notes issuance and amendment on february   we issued our notes that were sold with registration rights to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act of  and to certain non us persons in accordance with regulation s under the securities act of net proceeds after fees and expenses were used to pay down million of term loans and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility simultaneously in conjunction with the amendment 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture among us  certain subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee  and an intercreditor agreement among us  certain subsidiary grantors  bank of america  na  as first lien agent and control agent  and wells fargo bank  national association  as second lien collateral agent 
the notes pay interest semi annually on february and august  commencing august  the notes have no required principal payments prior to their maturity on february  the notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries with a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets that secure the amended credit facilities  and on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of our canadian subsidiaries 
as such the notes rank pari passu with all our senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated debt 
we can redeem the notes  in whole or in part  on or after february   at redemption prices ranging from to approximately  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  at any time prior to february   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings 
we may also redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of notes per twelve month period before february  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and redeem some or all of the notes before february  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  plus a make whole premium 
each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase such holder s notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon  upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the indenture that constitute a change in control 
the notes contain covenants  representations  and warranties substantially similar to our notes  including a senior secured debt to consolidated cash flow liens incurrence test 
the amendment provided us  among other things  the ability to pay down at least million of term loans and a portion of the revolving credit facility then outstanding with net proceeds from the notes 
the leverage covenant threshold within the amended credit facilities was reset requiring us to not exceed at any time during fiscal year  stepping down to during fiscal year and then reducing to for the remainder of the term of the amended credit facilities 
the interest coverage covenant was also reset  primarily to allow for interest to be paid on the notes  requiring us to not be less than through the end of the third quarter of  then the threshold steps up thereafter starting at in the fourth quarter of reaching in lenders to the amended credit facilities also granted us the ability to increase the revolving credit facility or terms loans by million subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions contained within the amended credit facilities 
additionally  the fiscal year mandatory excess cash flow payment that was to be made in march was waived given the substantial pay down of the term loans with net proceeds from the notes 
as conditions to the amendment  we agreed to reduce the revolving credit facility borrowing capacity  following a million capacity increase  from million to million when the amendment became effective 
further  the amendment  among other things  i added a maximum first lien leverage ratio covenant that we must be in pro forma compliance with at all times  which we refer to as the first lien leverage covenant  which ratio may not exceed for the first half of fiscal year and must be below thereafter to maturity of the amended credit facilities  and ii in calculating our financial covenants  modified our ability to add back certain amounts during a given month period and certain cost savings resulting from acquisitions 
no changes were made to pricing on the revolving credit facility or terms loans  while a basis points fee on a post amendment balance basis was paid to all consenting lenders who approved the amendment 
in connection with the amendment in the first quarter of  we will incur a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  of which million relates to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs and million relates to fees paid to consenting lenders 
in addition  we will capitalize million related to the amendment  of which million relates to amendment expenses and million relates to fees paid to consenting lenders  both of which will be amortized over the remaining life of the amended credit facilities 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we will capitalize million related to the issuance of the notes  of which million relates to fees paid to lenders  million relates to the original issuance discount and million relates to offering expenses  all of which will be amortized over the eight year life of the notes 
except as provided for in the amendment and amendment  all other provisions of our amended credit facilities remain in full force and effect  including our failure to operate within the revised leverage covenant and interest coverage covenant and new first lien leverage covenant ratio thresholds  in certain circumstances  or failure to have effective internal controls would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under the amended credit facilities 
such default could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the amended credit facilities and  by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  all of our then outstanding notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
as the amended credit facilities have senior secured and first priority lien position in our capital structure and the most restrictive covenants  then provided we are in compliance with the amended credit facilities  we would  in most circumstances  also be in compliance with the senior secured debt to consolidated cash flow lien incurrence tests within our notes and notes indentures and the fixed charge coverage lien incurrence tests within all of our outstanding notes indentures 
letters of credit on january   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and a de minimis amount of surety bonds related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating amended credit facilities notes notes notes notes outlook last update moody s b ba b b caa caa negative january standard poor s b bb b b b b negative january in march  standard poor s ratings services  which we refer to as standard poor s  lowered our corporate rating from bb to b and all of our debt credit ratings citing the negative impact of the current general economic environment and its anticipated impact on our results of operations 
in may  moody s investors services  which we refer to as moody s  lowered our corporate rating to b from b along with all of our debt credit ratings citing a combination of poor industry fundamentals  the expectation that an economic recovery will be quite slow and our leverage level 
in january  moody s and standard poor s affirmed our corporate rating and the ratings on our notes  notes and notes  while raising the rating on our amended credit facilities from ba to ba and bb to bb  respectively  in conjunction with the amendment and notes offering  which was rated b and b  respectively 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations  including planned capital expenditures 
we do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital if and or when needed 
some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings  however  we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings  additional quantitative and qualitative analyses must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition 
we expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs through  however  this cannot be assured 
off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of january  and january   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
guarantees 
in connection with the disposition of certain operations  we have indemnified the purchasers for certain contingencies as of the date of disposition 
we have accrued the estimated probable cost of these contingencies 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from estimates 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectability of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of january  and january   the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out or average cost basis 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories 
if there were to be a significant decrease in demand for our products  we could be required to reduce our inventory balances accordingly 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring and integration programs  we recorded impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the beginning of december and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
in and  we did not record any goodwill impairment charges 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million related to our commercial print and envelope reporting units  respectively 
as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit  we estimate the fair value of each unit  primarily using the income approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit  including projected future operating results  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the allocation of shared service or corporate items 
the market approach was used as a test of reasonableness of the conclusions reached in the income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  and property  plant and equipment 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our total enterprise value as implied by the market value of our equity securities 
this comparison indicated that  in total  our assumptions and estimates were not unreasonable 
however  future declines in the overall market value of our equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below their carrying value 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit had fair value in excess of its carrying amount or had carrying amount in excess of fair value for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in  each reporting unit had fair value in excess of carrying value with fair value exceeding carrying value by at least 
generally  changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a change in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
in  the discount rate for each reporting unit was estimated to be 
a basis point increase in our estimated discount rates would not have resulted in any additional reporting units failing step one 
determining whether an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred requires an analysis of the fair value of each of the related tradenames 
we determined that there was no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets  however  if our estimates of the valuations of our tradenames prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future periods 
our annual impairment analysis for trade names utilizes a relief from royalty method in which the hypothetical benefits of owning each respective trade name are valued by discounting hypothetical royalty revenue over projected revenues covered by the trade names 
we utilized royalty rates of to for the use of the subject trade names based on comparable market rates  the profitability of the product employing the trade name  and qualitative factors  such as the strength of the name and years in usage 
we utilized a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for the respective business plus a premium to account for the relative risks of the subject trade name 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations for all of our indefinite lived trade names  we applied hypothetical  and decreases to the estimated fair value of our trade names 
such hypothetical decreases in fair value could be due to changes in discount rates and or assumed royalty rates 
these hypothetical  and decreases in estimated fair value would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our identifiable indefinite lived trade names 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of january  and january   the undiscounted liability was million and million  respectively  and the discounted liability was million and million  respectively  using a discount rate 
workers compensation expense incurred in  and was million  million and million  respectively  and was based on actuarial estimates 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of january  and january  we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of january  and january   respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents between and days of unreported claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we have recorded 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
since a significant portion of our products are customer specific  it is common for our customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities prior to shipment 
products shipped are not subject to contractual right of return provisions 
we have rebate agreements with certain customers 
these rebates are recorded as reductions of sales and are accrued using sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement 
we record sales net of applicable sales tax and freight costs that are included in the price of the product are included in net sales while the costs of delivering finished goods to customers are recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate which primarily includes the us  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of january  and january   we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  from our us operations 
the change in us net deferred taxes is primarily due to an increase in our tax loss carryforward that can be used to offset taxable income in future years partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liability related to our intangible assets acquired in the nashua acquisition 
as of january  and january   we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered our recent operating results and anticipated future taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of and  we adjusted our valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily due to the release of valuation allowance against goodwill in connection with the acquisition of nashua  and approximately million  respectively  to reflect the realization of deferred tax assets 
the remaining portion of our valuation allowance will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
when sufficient positive evidence occurs  our income tax expense will be reduced to the extent we decrease the amount of our valuation allowance 
the increase or reversal of all or a portion of our tax valuation allowance could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 
we recognize a tax position in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
this recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we adjust such reserves upon changes in circumstances that would cause a change to the estimate of the ultimate liability  upon effective settlement or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations  in the period in which such event occurs 
during  we reduced our liabilities for uncertain tax positions by million as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months we may decrease our liability for uncertain tax positions by approximately million due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we record annual amounts relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates  anticipated rates of return  compensation increases and current mortality rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so 
the effects of modifications are recognized immediately on our consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into our consolidated statement of operations over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience  market conditions and input from our actuaries and investment advisors 
we determine our assumption for the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual service and interest costs based on the citigroup pension liability index as of our respective year end dates 
the weighted average discount rates for pension and other postretirement benefits at january  and january   were and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rates at january  would increase the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rates at january  would decrease the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on the pension plan assets within prudent levels of risk 
investments are primarily diversified with a blend of equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments 
equity investments are diversified by including us and us stocks  growth stocks  value stocks and stocks of large and small companies 
fixed income securities are primarily us governmental and corporate bonds  including mutual funds 
alternative investments are primarily private equity hedge funds and hedge fund of funds 
we consult with our financial advisors on a regular basis regarding our investment objectives and asset performance 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
commitments and contingencies our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks  the most of which are summarized in item a risk factors and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure of notional amounts of our floating rate debt 
as of january  and january   we had million and million  respectively  of such interest rate swaps 
on june   million notional amount interest rate swap agreements matured and were partially replaced by million of forward starting interest rate swaps that went effective on the same date as the maturing swap agreements 
our hedges of interest rate risk were designated and documented at inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly 
in conjunction with the amendment and issuance of the notes in the first quarter of  we de designated million of interest rate swap agreements previously used to hedge interest rate exposure on notional floating rate debt  of which million are to mature in the second quarter of and million are to mature in march we did not terminate these interest rate swap agreements  however we may terminate them at any time prior to each respective scheduled maturity date 
any ineffectiveness  as a result of these de designations  will be marked to market through interest expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of these de designated swaps currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet will be amortized to interest expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations over the remaining life of each respective interest rate swap agreement 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is primarily libor plus a margin 
as of january   we had variable rate debt outstanding of million  after considering our interest rate swaps 
a increase in libor on debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended january   a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
