general we are a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced  high value added specialty chemicals and advanced materials 
we serve more than  customers across a wide variety of industries and geographic areas 
we operate through five business segments specialty chemicals  performance additives  titanium dioxide pigments  advanced ceramics  and specialty compounds 
our net sales consist of sales of our products  net of sales discounts  product returns and allowances 
in addition  net sales include shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis 
our cost of products sold consists of variable and fixed components 
our variable costs are proportional to volume and consist principally of raw materials  packaging and related supplies  certain energy costs  and certain distribution costs including inbound  outbound  and internal shipping and transfer costs 
our fixed costs are not significantly impacted by production volume and consist principally of certain fixed manufacturing costs and other distribution network costs  including warehousing 
fixed manufacturing costs comprise headcount related costs and overhead  including depreciation  periodic maintenance costs  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs and certain energy costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include research and development costs  sales and marketing  divisional management expenses and corporate services including cash management  legal  benefit plan administration and other administrative and professional services 
we are focused on growth  productivity  cost reduction  margin expansion  bolt on acquisitions  divestment of non core businesses and debt reduction 
in connection with this focus  among other things in the first half of  we repurchased a portion of our euro denominated senior subordinated notes due in  voluntarily prepaid a portion of our senior secured term loans and amended our senior secured credit agreement 
see discussion below in liquidity and capital resources for further details 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced overhead and eliminated duplicative positions throughout the company as part of our global cost control initiatives 
to cope with the downturn in the economy  we have continued this activity in  and we remain focused on reducing costs  improving productivity  and conserving cash by controlling working capital and capital spending  we acquired holliday pigments in august  which is included in our color pigments and service business  and in september  we acquired nalco s finishing technologies business which is included in our specialty chemicals segment  we completed the titanium dioxide pigments venture with kemira in september  and in october  we completed the sale of our pool and spa chemicals business  factors which affect our results of operations our markets because the businesses in our segments generally serve many unrelated end use markets  we discuss the principal market conditions on a segment basis rather than a consolidated basis 
the principal market conditions in our segments and regions in which we operate that impacted our results of operations during the periods presented include the following specialty chemicals demand for surface treatment products in our specialty chemicals segment generally follows the activity levels of metal processing manufacturers  including the automotive supply  steel and aerospace industries 
sales growth in the surface treatment business occurred in in most markets and regions served  primarily aerospace  general industrial and european automotive industries 
this growth was driven by price increases and the impact of bolt on acquisitions that offset raw material cost increases and lower volumes from a slowdown in the automotive markets 
in  results declined on lower volumes in most businesses  partially offset by increased selling prices 
sales growth is expected in primarily from higher volumes across most markets 
demand for our lithium carbonate products in the fine chemicals business line of our specialty chemicals segment is generally driven by demand in industrial applications  the aluminum business  glass ceramics  cement and the general demand in china 
sales of lithium products specifically used in life science applications depend on the trends in drug development and growth in pharmaceuticals markets as well as generic competition 
growth in the fine chemicals business occurred in in most market segments  driven by price increases and higher volumes of lithium applications 
in  lower volumes in most applications  particularly in lithium and metal sulfide applications  had a negative impact on results 
results in are expected to be negatively impacted by the highly competitive business environment  partially offset by higher volumes in lithium applications 
performance additives generally  a trend towards the increased use of colored concrete products in the construction market has historically had a positive effect on our color pigments and services business line 
however  a general slowdown in the construction market has negatively impacted construction sales 
north american and european volumes were lower in and continued to decline in a continued slowdown in the construction industry could have a negative impact on our results in demand for our wood protection products  in particular alkaline copper quaternary  or acq  is generally driven by both repair and remodeling  as well as new construction 
the market position of acq was negatively impacted in and by a general slowdown in the construction market  some customer shifts to substitute products and the use of wood substitutes 
a continued slowdown in the construction industry could have a negative impact on our results in in the clay based additives business  net sales increased in as increased selling prices and volumes for oilfield applications and increased selling prices of coatings and inks were partially offset by lower volumes of coatings and carbonless applications 
in  net sales decreased as lower volumes in most applications were partially offset by increased selling prices 
we expect modest sales growth in primarily from higher volumes in most market segments 
titanium dioxide pigments demand for our titanium dioxide products in anatase grade is driven mainly by demand in the synthetic fiber industry  while demand for titanium dioxide products in rutile grade and our functional additives is driven by demand in the coatings  printing inks  construction  cosmetics  pharmaceutical  food  paper and plastics industries 
market conditions  including pricing pressure and current industry overcapacity  have continued to negatively impact this segment 
volumes and selling prices in fiber anatase applications decreased in in  net sales decreased as lower volumes of fiber anatase applications were partially offset by increased selling prices 
sales of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade were down in due to lower selling prices  partially offset by slightly higher volumes 
in  sales of rutile applications were up due to higher volumes as a result of the venture with kemira that was completed on september   and higher selling prices 
we expect sales of rutile and anatase applications to be higher in our functional additives sales were down in on lower volumes  partially offset by increased selling prices 
in  functional additives sales were down as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices 
we expect sales of functional additives to be higher in advanced ceramics demand for our ceramic medical devices is mainly tied to the aging population in europe and the united states 
sales of our medical device applications increased in on higher volumes and continued to increase in we expect this growth to continue in despite the negative impact of pricing pressure from asian competitors  sales of ceramic products for use in cutting tool products were up slightly in on higher volumes 
sales of these applications were lower in  but are expected to be slightly higher in sales of mechanical systems and applications  electronic applications and multi functional applications were down in from lower volumes  particularly related to the economic downturn in the automotive industry 
however  sales of these applications are expected to be slightly higher in specialty compounds our largest product line in the specialty compounds segment is wire and cable compounds 
sales within this product line are dependent upon the telecommunications market and related sectors  specifically demand for high end voice and data communication wire and cable  for which our specialty compounds segment is a significant provider of sheathing materials 
newly developed non halogen products for wire and cable data communication  military and other applications have expanded business in north america for those applications and created opportunities in europe 
however  as a result of a general downturn in the wire and cable market  volumes of wire and cable products were down in and in  we expect sales of wire and cable products to be up slightly 
most of the other end use markets for which specialty compounds products are used generally track growth of gross domestic product  but many are also application specific  such as automotive 
we are focusing more of our efforts towards increasing high margin specialty products  in particular  thermoplastic elastomers  and less of our efforts in automotive and footwear 
our net sales in consumer industrial thermoplastic elastomers were flat in  but were lower in net sales of regulated packaging were lower in and in  we expect sales of these applications to be up slightly 
raw material prices for polyvinyl chloride pvc resin and plasticizers  key raw materials used in the production of most products  were down in  but are expected to be slightly higher in global exposure we operate a geographically diverse business 
of our net sales  were shipments to europe  to north america predominantly the united states and to the rest of the world 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
we have sold to customers in more than countries during this period 
currently  we serve our diverse and extensive customer base with manufacturing facilities in countries 
consequently  we are exposed to global economic and political changes  particularly currency fluctuations that could impact our profitability and demand for our products 
our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars or euros 
our results of operations and financial condition have been historically impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
for the year ended december   the average exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar was lower compared to as a result  our net sales  gross profit and operating income were negatively impacted 
historically  however  our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations because  in general  sales and costs of products sold are generated or incurred in the same currency  subject to certain exceptions 
raw materials raw materials constituted approximately of our cost of products sold 
we have a broad raw material base  with the cost of no single raw material representing more than of our cost of products sold in in  lower raw material costs in a number of our businesses had a favorable impact on our results of operations 
however  the significant price fluctuations our raw materials have experienced in the past during periods of high demand have had an adverse impact on our results of operations 
for example  higher prices for iron oxide used in the color pigments business of our performance additives segment had a negative impact on results in and we cannot accurately predict the impact of any future price increases for raw materials or any raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions 
in addition  we may not be able to pass on raw material price increases to our customers 
see details of our ten most significant raw materials in terms of dollars in item  business raw materials 
energy costs in  energy purchases represented approximately of our cost of products sold 
however  within certain business lines  such as our titanium dioxide pigments segment and the color pigments and services and clay based additives businesses of our performance additives segment  energy costs are more significant 
the cost of products sold for certain of our businesses  including color pigments and services and clay based additives  increases when the price of natural gas in north america rises 
however  energy costs in were lower in a number of our businesses  particularly in north america 
natural gas prices in north america were relatively stable in  increased during  but declined in natural gas prices in europe  where our titanium dioxide pigments segment is located  were higher in and  but declined in income taxes as of december   the company has us federal and foreign corporate tax loss carryforwards excluding state and local amounts of approximately million  of which million expire in  million expire between and and million which have no current expiration date 
the company also has state and local tax loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring in years through the worldwide valuation allowance increased by million to million at december  of this amount  million was a charge to income tax expense relating primarily to net operating losses and million primarily represents an increase to other comprehensive income 
acquisitions we did not complete any acquisitions in however  during and  we made certain selective acquisitions and strategic transactions pursuant to our business strategy of achieving profitable growth 
see note  acquisitions  for further details 
special charges and credits during the periods presented  we incurred certain special charges that included goodwill impairment charges  systems organization establishment expenses  restructuring and other severance costs  foreign exchange gains and losses and inventory write up charges 
see items excluded from adjusted ebitda section in note  segment information  for a discussion of special charges and credits recorded in the years ended december   and special note regarding non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the sec as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time in this management s discussion and analysis  we disclose non gaap financial measures  primarily adjusted ebitda  as defined below 
definition of adjusted ebitda the presentation of consolidated adjusted ebitda contained in this report is calculated using the definition set forth in the senior secured credit agreement as a basis and reflects management s interpretations thereof 
adjusted ebitda  which is referred to under the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated ebitda  is defined in the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated earnings which  as defined in the senior secured credit agreement  equals income loss before the deduction of income taxes of rockwood specialties group  inc and the restricted subsidiaries as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  excluding extraordinary items plus interest expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  including amortization of deferred financing fees  extraordinary losses and non recurring charges  non cash charges  losses on asset sales  restructuring charges or reserves including severance  relocation costs and one time compensation charges and costs relating to the closure of facilities  expenses paid by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition  the senior secured credit agreement  the granting of liens under the security documents as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  the indenture governing the notes and the offering of the notes and any other related transactions  any expenses or charges incurred in connection with any issuance of debt or equity securities  any fees and expenses related to permitted acquisitions  any deduction for noncontrolling interest expense  and items arising in connection with cca litigation related to our timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment  less extraordinary gains and non recurring gains  non cash gains  and gains on asset sales  in all cases  subject to certain exclusions 
for presentation purposes within this report  we use the computation set forth in our senior secured credit agreement as a basis which reflects management s interpretations thereof 
management has determined that stock based compensation costs  which are non cash charges  will not be an adjustment in calculating adjusted ebitda as these costs will be an ongoing recurring cost to the company 
these costs are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
specifically  the calculation of adjusted ebitda according to the indenture underlying our notes and the facility agreement governing our titanium dioxide pigments venture excludes certain adjustments prescribed within the senior secured credit agreement 
given that borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement are secured by most of our assets and given that the calculation does not materially differ from the calculation of adjusted ebitda for performance measurement purposes  we believe this is the most appropriate computation of adjusted ebitda to present 
management s uses we use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis to assess our operating performance 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is helpful in highlighting trends in our overall business because the items excluded in calculating adjusted ebitda have been deemed by management to have little or no bearing on our day to day operating performance 
it is also the most significant criterion in our calculation of performance based cash bonuses and our determination of whether certain performance based stock options and restricted stock units vest  all of which are tied to adjusted ebitda targets 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because our senior secured credit agreement and indenture governing the notes contain financial covenants that are determined based on adjusted ebitda 
these covenants are material terms of these agreements  because they govern substantially all of our long term debt  which in turn represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our senior secured credit facilities our maximum total leverage ratio and our minimum interest coverage ratio  in particular could result in the lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
any such acceleration could also lead to the noteholders accelerating the maturity of the notes 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants in the indenture governing the notes  we cannot engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness or making certain payments 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a segment basis as the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker  our chief executive officer  to evaluate the ongoing performance of our business segments and reporting units 
on a segment basis  we define adjusted ebitda as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization  certain non cash gains and charges  certain other special gains and charges determined by our senior management to be non recurring gains and charges and certain items deemed by our senior management to have little or no bearing on the day to day operating performance of our business segments and reporting units 
the adjustments made to operating income directly correlate with the adjustments to net income in calculating adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis pursuant to the senior secured credit agreement  which reflects management s interpretations thereof 
limitations adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for us gaap measures of earnings and cash flows 
material limitations associated with making the adjustments to our earnings and cash flows to calculate adjusted ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures  include the cash portion of interest expense  net  income tax provision benefit  and restructuring as well as non recurring charges related to securities issuance  acquisition activities  and systems organization establishment  generally represent charges gains which may significantly affect funds available to use in our operating  investing and financing activities  non operating foreign exchange gains losses  although not immediately affecting cash used in investing activities  may affect the amount of funds needed to service our debt if those currency impacts remain in place as we meet our future principal repayment obligations  and depreciation  amortization  non cash gains charges and impairment charges  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of the plant  equipment and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and or market our products  these items may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  for development or acquisition of intangible assets or relevant trends causing asset value changes 
an investor or potential investor may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
management compensates for the limitations of using non gaap financial measures by using them only to supplement our us gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations before taxes or operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measures 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to us gaap financial measures and other financial information  in each case included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to those of other companies 
results of operations actual results of operations the following table presents the major components of our operations on an actual basis and adjusted ebitda the reconciliation to net loss income is set forth in reconciliation of net loss income attributable to rockwood holdings  inc to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and  including as a percentage of net sales  for the periods presented

our primary liquidity requirements are working capital  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our debt service requirements in future years are significant and are substantially higher than historical amounts 
we believe that based on current conditions in our industry and markets  our cash reserves  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate sources of liquidity 
however  a prolonged economic downturn or recession may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows from operations and our liquidity 
see item  business  and item a  risk factors 
in addition  our liquidity may be negatively impacted due to funding obligations related to certain pension plans 
we have several pension plans located in germany  finland  the united kingdom and the united states  which were adversely impacted by market conditions in late and early although recent investment performance of assets in pension plans covering our employees in these countries has reduced the amount of any immediate funding obligations and we have entered into long term funding arrangements for pension plans located in germany and the uk  we may have to make a significant payment via a one time payment and or long term funding arrangement for the finnish plan 
however  our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets 
any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may materially and adversely impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and adversely impact our liquidity 
we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations

the senior secured credit agreement also reset the asset sales basket  increased the available amount basket that applies to certain investment  debt and capital expenditure negative covenants and certain other baskets 
these covenants are material terms of the senior secured credit agreement 
non compliance with these covenants or other covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indenture governing the notes  which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable 
the senior secured credit agreement contains a cross default provision for indebtedness in excess of million  therefore  a default under the indenture governing the notes  the titanium dioxide pigments term loans or other indebtedness may cause the lenders to declare the principal and interest on the then outstanding senior secured credit facilities immediately due and payable 
in addition to the financial covenants described above  the company s senior secured credit facilities contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants 
the restrictive covenants limit our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness and other liabilities  create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  make investments  pay dividends and make payments to shareholders  make payments on certain indebtedness or to amend documents related to certain indebtedness and to enter into sale leaseback transactions

the restrictive covenants limit our ability  and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries  to  among other things  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness as described below  pay dividends or make other equity distributions or repurchase capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  create liens  transfer or sell assets  restrict dividends or other payments to us  engage in transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets 
the indenture governing the notes prohibits us from incurring additional debt  subject to certain permitted incurrences  unless the fixed charge coverage ratio  which is the ratio of adjusted ebitda as defined therein excluding certain adjustments permitted under the senior secured credit agreement to fixed charges as defined therein  for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to in addition  the indenture prohibits us from making restricted payments such as dividends or other equity distributions  repurchases of capital stock or restricted investments  subject to certain permitted payments  unless  among other things  the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to for the four fiscal quarter period ended december   the fixed charge coverage ratio equaled to this covenant is a material term of the indenture governing the notes 
because the indenture governing the notes defines an event of default to include  among other things  a default under any other debt obligation in excess of million that could cause the acceleration of such obligation  any acceleration under the senior secured credit agreement or other debt agreement would also result in a default under the indenture governing these notes  which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable

we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following to be the most critical accounting policies and estimates affecting preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
product sales are recognized when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that we have adequate credit granting procedures in place and operating effectively so that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a low incidence of uncollectible accounts 
additionally  credit insurance is purchased at times by certain of our businesses  particularly in europe  to protect against collection risk 
accruals are made for sales returns based on our experience and for other allowances based on the terms of allowance programs put in place 
although we believe that sufficient experience and history exists to make reasonable estimates as to such accruals and allowances  actual results can differ depending on market conditions 
impairment accounting 
the recoverability of goodwill is reviewed on an annual basis during the fourth quarter 
additionally  the recoverability of goodwill  long lived tangible  and other intangible assets is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we have determined that our reporting units for our goodwill impairment review are our operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
based on this analysis  we have identified nine reporting units within our reportable segments 
in accordance with the accounting guidance on determining a goodwill impairment  there is a two step method 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of each reporting unit as discussed in the following sentence and compare that fair value to the carrying value of such reporting unit 
this begins with our estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  which we derive from peer multiples 
specifically  we base our estimate of the fair value of such reporting unit on an industry metric that is the ratio of enterprise value ev which is commonly defined as market capitalization  plus long term debt  less cash to adjusted ebitda of the relevant benchmark peer companies and groups  we refer to this as the peer multiple approach 
the peer companies are typically based upon the competitors disclosed in item  business for each of our reporting units 
we use ev multiples to the last twelve months adjusted ebitda and to the next fiscal year adjusted ebitda 
we then multiply this ratio by the adjusted ebitda for the recently completed year and the budgeted adjusted ebitda for the upcoming year of such reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of such reporting unit 
if the product of such peer multiple and reporting unit s adjusted ebitda is less than such carrying value  it may be an indication of an impairment 
if our initial review indicates there may be an impairment  we perform a review based on expected future cash flows  we refer to this as the discounted cash flow approach 
for the discounted cash flow approach  the company makes certain assumptions about  among other things  estimates of future cash flows  including growth rates  price increases  capital expenditures  the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies  and an appropriate discount rate 
if the results of the peer multiple approach and the discounted cash flow approach differ materially  we would review the relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting 
if the results of the first step indicate the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  the second step must be performed 
specifically  the company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company had acquired those reporting units 
in the second step  the potential impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
if necessary  we may consult with valuation specialists to assist with our goodwill impairment review 
for the years ended december  and  we did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss as a result of the impairment analysis that was performed 
in the fourth quarter of  we tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of our annual review 
in connection with the determination of fair value of the reporting units  we made significant estimates and assumptions with respect to those reporting units and engaged independent valuation specialists to assist with this review 
the first step of our review indicated that the fair values of our color pigments and services  timber treatment chemicals  clay based additives  titanium dioxide pigments  specialty compounds and rubber chemicals reporting units were less than their carrying values 
accordingly  we were required to complete the second step of the impairment review 
to compute the amount of the impairment  the company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company had acquired those reporting units 
specifically  the company allocated the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities of that unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two 
based on the results of the second step of the impairment review  we determined and recorded goodwill impairment charges in our color pigments and services business million  timber treatment chemicals business million and clay based additives business million within our performance additives segment  titanium dioxide pigments segment million  and specialty compounds segment  including our rubber chemicals business million 
the goodwill impairment charges were attributed to the significant drop in global stock valuations  the substantial reduction in the market valuation of rockwood and comparable companies  and the continuing negative global economic and market outlook 
in particular  the downturn in the construction industry has had a negative impact on a number of our businesses 
these calculations are based on inherent assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and appropriate benchmark peer companies or groups 
subsequent changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
for example  if the company had applied a reduction in the peer multiples of its reporting units in  no potential goodwill impairment would exist at any of our reporting units 
in  if the company had applied a reduction in the peer multiples of the reporting units that were not impaired  there may have been an additional potential goodwill impairment in two of our reporting units 
in  if the company had applied a reduction in all peer multiples for all reporting units  no potential goodwill impairment would exist at any of our reporting units  except for one reporting unit for which there may have been a potential impairment 
as noted above  if we had discovered such a potential impairment  we might have expanded the review to prepare more detailed estimates of future cash flows in subsequent years  which might have resulted in a different impairment assessment 
prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of  we performed a recoverability test of certain long lived assets 
as a result  we concluded that there was no impairment of those assets in the fourth quarter of business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we are required to allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
examples of material estimates from our previous acquisitions are the fair values of work in process and finished goods inventories are estimated based on selling price less selling profit 
the calculation of selling profit requires a judgment on the relative margins derived from manufacturing vs 
marketing efforts 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment can be estimated by a variety of methods taking into account market values  replacement cost  and remaining useful life 
although market value and replacement cost is sometimes readily obtainable  often this requires judgment  as does determining the estimated remaining useful life 
when we believe that property  plant and equipment acquired will be material to our overall balance sheet  or that fair value might represent a significant difference from the historical cost net of accumulated depreciation of such assets  we have engaged an independent appraiser to assist us on such estimates  as we have done in our recent acquisitions 
however  it is not uncommon for appraisers to differ on the valuation of items such as manufacturing equipment where a ready secondary market does not exist 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as patents and other intellectual property  customer lists  and trademarks  can be estimated by discounted cash flow and return on royalties 
the process utilized to identify intangible assets is consistent with the requirements of the accounting guidance on business combinations 
when considered material  we have engaged an independent appraiser to assist us in the identification of intangible assets acquired  valuation of such assets and determination of the estimated useful life 
an independent appraiser  with management s oversight and input  is required to make judgments and estimates that could cause such appraisals to differ from those of other appraisal experts 
in order to determine the fair value of intangible assets and other long term assets  a discount rate and royalty rate are determined in conjunction with our independent appraiser 
the royalty rate is based on professional judgment taking into consideration the type of product  market and perceived strength 
the discount rate and royalty rate have a material impact on the determination of the fair value 
purchase accounting often involves the same critical estimates that are required in our ordinary course of business including estimates of deferred tax assets or liabilities  pension liabilities  restructuring liabilities and legal and environmental reserves 
goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
while goodwill itself does not represent an estimate  we must assign goodwill to one or more reporting units 
allocation of goodwill to reporting units requires judgments about the relative fair values of reporting units including the fair value of their identifiable assets and estimates as to the present value of future cash flows expected from the reporting units as adjusted by weighted average and or risk adjusted costs of capital 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 
some of our business combinations have complex terms that may result in conflicting claims between buyers and sellers concerning the purchase price itself 
management is required to assess the probability and amount or range of amounts of such claims  and  where possible  determine the most likely amount due 
legal matters 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  intellectual property and environmental matters  of a nature that can be expected in our business 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
the probability that a contingent liability has been incurred is regularly assessed by our legal staff  based on periodic reviews of available facts and circumstances for our legal matters  with senior operating and finance management both at the business accountable for the potential liability and at our corporate offices 
this is supplemented where applicable by consultation with outside counsel 
we do not believe it is informative to quantify past experience at assessing probability or estimating exposure since material matters of this nature at rockwood often represent unique situations with little applicability to the assessment of probability or estimation of potential liability regarding other legal matters 
it is our policy to disclose such matters when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
environmental matters 
we accrue costs of a non capital nature related to environmental clean up when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized  and expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or present operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible are immediately expensed 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement 
as such  it can be extremely difficult to accurately estimate such costs 
we do not include anticipated recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties in our accruals for environmental liabilities 
we have estimated and established financial reserves relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and remediation and closure costs 
on a consolidated basis  we have accrued approximately million for known environmental liabilities as of december  given that these obligations may be paid relieved over extended time periods years in some cases  charges or credits to operations may be required as information is gathered and estimates refined 
we have evaluated our total environmental exposure based on currently available data and believe that such environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
if matters previously identified by management are resolved in a manner different from original estimates  there is the potential for a material adverse effect on operating results or cash flows in any one accounting period 
see note  commitments and contingencies 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges from time to time that represent expenses incurred in connection with consolidations and cessations of certain of our operations as well as headcount reduction programs 
these charges consist primarily of write offs of surplus assets and severance costs 
these charges are based on various factors including the employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary levels and local governmental legislation 
at the time a related charge is recorded  we calculate our best estimate based upon detailed analysis 
although significant changes are not expected  actual costs may differ from these estimates 
for example  we have accrued liabilities of million as of december  to cover restructuring liabilities for employee severance  facility closure and relocation costs 
the portion of this accrued liability that was recorded as part of purchase accounting is not charged to operations  but was recorded as part of goodwill 
in the event that our estimates of such costs are too low  an additional charge to operations would be required 
income taxes 
valuation allowance we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence weighted toward evidence that is objectively verifiable 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our recorded net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
we have cumulative net operating loss carry forwards in the us  germany and china for which we have reserved 
the valuation allowance also includes certain states in the us as we have concluded realizability of these net operating loss carryforwards is not more likely than not 
we have not recorded valuation allowances on a significant portion of our german net operating loss carryforwards as we have considered positive evidence such as forecasted future taxable income based on historical taxable income adjusted for charges which are not indicative of future operations and as the carryforward period is indefinite 
we consider future taxable income and other available evidence when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
various assumptions and strategies including elections for tax purposes are implicit in estimates of forecasted future taxable income 
we believe that  in situations in which future realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on taxable income from future operations  the relative significance of cumulative losses be addressed 
accordingly  in assessing the realization of us jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards for the years ended december   and  and  considering future taxable income  we have identified the key elements of both positive and negative evidence and evaluated such evidence 
the worldwide valuation allowance increased by million to million at december  of this amount  million was a charge to income tax expense relating primarily to net operating losses and million primarily represents an increase to other comprehensive income 
as of december   we had three years of net cumulative losses in the uk as such  we evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets of million related to our uk entities 
for any specific jurisdiction where a history of three years of cumulative losses has occurred or where there has been a substantial change in the business eg  a major acquisition or divestiture  the company s policy is to determine its need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  if any  by calculating an average steady state normalized taxable income amount over the last three years  adjusted for acquisitions or divestitures if necessary 
the steady state calculation includes management assumptions that relate to the appropriateness of certain items  such as  including permanent cost savings which have been are being implemented and excluding one time items 
in accordance with this policy  we calculated the average annual income before taxes in the uk on a steady state normalized basis 
we continue to be profitable on a normalized basis 
we additionally considered the nature of the uk net deferred tax assets which includes unused tax depreciation capital allowances in the uk under uk law  this tax attribute can be utilized indefinitely 
accordingly  we concluded that given the level of profitability and given their unlimited life  these assets should more likely than not be realizable as of december  in the uk and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded as of such date 
we are committed to buying and selling businesses within our portfolio of businesses as opportunities arise to enhance our overall results 
we are committed to selling assets which are non core and which would generate a taxable gain in the event of expiring us federal nol s 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted a standard that clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
the company is subject to taxation in the us  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
as part of the adoption of this standard  we evaluated all tax positions taken including the existing tax liabilities recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies  and evaluated whether such tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
if the position met the more likely than not threshold test  we estimated the amount of the benefit that would be more than likely to be sustained upon ultimate settlement 
the estimate includes management s judgment of the amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement  taking into account all facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
although we have a full valuation allowance on the us net deferred tax assets and certain us states  we have evaluated the us positions as well as foreign positions 
liabilities associated with positions taken as part of purchase accounting have been recorded as part of goodwill 
based on our year end analysis  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million excluding interest and penalties on a gross basis 
the ultimate settlement of this liability is subject to tax audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations 
as such  actual results will differ from our estimates 
in accordance with our policy  we have offset the gross liability in respect of our uncertain tax positions against deferred taxes where settlement of such liability would reduce tax loss carry forwards 
on a net basis  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million excluding interest and penalties as of december  to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have declined improved by million in stock based compensation 
we have a stock based compensation plan which includes stock options  restricted stock and other stock based awards 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  stock based compensation  for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
in accordance with the accounting guidance on stock compensation  we record stock compensation expense associated with our equity awards 
the accounting for stock compensation is a critical accounting estimate  which requires judgments and assumptions that have an impact on our financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions of expected term  expected volatility and risk free rates 
changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate 
the fair value of our performance restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our stock 
these performance based equity awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance goals  which in turn impacts our compensation expense 
in addition  the recognition of expense is only recorded for awards that will eventually vest 
this requires pre vesting forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and modified  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 
our forfeiture rates are based upon historical share based equity award cancellations 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  pensions  postemployment and postretirement costs 
in connection with prior year acquisitions  particularly the kkr and dynamit nobel acquisition  rockwood assumed responsibility for the pension and postretirement benefits for substantially all of the employees of the businesses acquired that were active as of the date of the acquisition 
for the kkr acquisition  obligations related to retired and terminated vested employees as of such date remained the responsibility of the seller  and accordingly  these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit costs and liabilities and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits 
postemployment benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with the accounting guidance for nonretirement postemployment benefits 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  with consideration to the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases due to marketplace conditions and or inflation and demographic experience such as retirement and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions or benefit payments 
for funded plans  the plan trustee obtains an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets and prepares estimates of expected returns based on target asset allocations multiplied by current marketplace rates of return for comparable assets 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore are likely to affect our recognized expense in those periods 
we cannot predict these bond yields or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to our stockholders equity for minimum pension liability in subsequent years will be significant 
estimated sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity and annual pension expense to a increase decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below as of and for the year ended december  the estimates were based on inquiries of all plan actuaries 
the december  funded status and stockholders equity are affected by assumptions as of december  while annual pension expense is affected by december  assumptions as of december  in millions us plans non us plans pension impact of a change in discount rate funded status funded status equity expense basis points basis points as shown above  changes in the discount rate can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans and stockholders equity 
as noted above  the funded status and stockholders equity of our funded plans might also be significantly affected by assumptions concerning expected return of plan assets 
however  given that most of our pension obligations do not require funding  such sensitivity would be significantly less 
useful lives of plant and equipment 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for our plant and equipment 
depreciation is determined using the straight line method over the various asset classes 
estimated lives generally range from years for buildings and improvements including land improvements  years for machinery and equipment  years for furniture and fixtures and years for mining rights 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our depreciation charge or will write off or write down obsolete assets 
to the extent that our plant and equipment actual useful lives differ from management s estimates by  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates 
useful lives of other intangible assets 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related amortization charges for our other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily consist of patents and other intellectual property  trade names and trademarks  and customer relationships 
patents and other intellectual property are recorded at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition and are being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives  ranging from years 
trade names and trademarks are being amortized from years  customer relationships are amortized from years and supply agreements are being amortized from years 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization charge or will write off or write down obsolete other intangible assets 
to the extent that the actual useful lives of our other intangible assets differ from management s estimates by  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives 
when used  derivatives are employed as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk we had  million a portion of which is subject to a libor or euribor floor of and million of variable rate debt after hedging outstanding as of december  and  respectively  at the then applicable exchange rate 
any borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the titanium dioxide pigments venture revolving credit facility are at a variable rate with the senior secured revolving credit facility subject to a libor or euribor floor of 
as of december   we had million million outstanding under the titanium dioxide pigments venture revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of december  although we are not required under the terms of any of our long term debt facilities to hedge  or otherwise protect against interest rate fluctuation in our variable rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates related to variable rate debt 
in november  a contract covering a notional amount of million matured and contracts covering notional amounts of million were terminated resulting in a payment of million 
as of december   the remaining contracts cover notional amounts of million at interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   the contracts covered notional amounts of million at interest rates ranging from to and million at interest rates ranging from to 
the derivative contracts as of december  effectively convert a portion of the senior secured credit obligations and a portion of the obligations under the titanium dioxide pigments term loan facility to fixed rate obligations 
these hedges will mature between december and july the company has not applied hedge accounting for these interest rate swaps and has recorded the mark to market of these derivatives as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may in the future consider adjusting the amounts covered by these derivative contracts to better suit our capital structure 
each increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average interest rate would change the annual interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we operate a geographically diverse business  with of our net sales in generated from customers in europe  in north america predominantly in the united states and from the rest of the world based upon customer ship to locations 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries  our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars and euros 
our results of operations and financial condition are therefore impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
approximately of our net sales were derived from subsidiaries whose local currency is the euro 
this increases the impact of the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar 
we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
gains and losses on currency transactions are included in operating income and do impact our operating margins 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on currency translations are recorded in our consolidated financial statements as a component of other comprehensive income loss and do not impact our operating margins 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
in december  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party sales denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these foreign currency forward contracts hedged the exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates for forecasted transactions for twelve months 
we hedged such exposures with foreign currency forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure 
therefore  the instruments were designated as foreign exchange cash flow hedges and are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction 
as a result  any foreign currency gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of the derivative is accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income for as long as the hedge remains effective 
see discussion of derivative contracts under note  derivatives for further details 
our financial results are subject to the effect of currency fluctuations on the translation of our euro denominated debt 
as of december  and  our total euro denominated debt equaled million  million and  million  million  respectively 
a weakening or strengthening of the euro against the us dollar by would decrease or increase  respectively  by million and million in and  respectively  the us dollar equivalent of our total euro denominated debt 
gains and losses on the translation of debt denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower are included as a separate component of other expenses  net in our statement of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income in our balance sheet 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap in november with a notional amount of million that effectively converted the us dollar fixed rate debt in respect of the dollar denominated notes sold into euro fixed rate debt 
the company paid million in connection with the settlement of this cross currency swap in november we designated this contract as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in our euro denominated operations 
in addition  we designated the remaining portion of our euro denominated debt that is recorded on our us books as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated investments as of october  euro debt of million at december   million 
as a result  any foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the euro denominated debt discussed above is accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk for certain of our raw materials  such as copper and zinc 
we have not materially hedged this commodity price exposure to date 
in march  we entered into derivative contracts in our titanium dioxide pigments segment to protect a portion of our exposure to movements in certain raw materials prices 
these contracts expired in november we elected not to apply hedge accounting for these derivative contracts and recorded the mark to market of these contracts in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of operations
