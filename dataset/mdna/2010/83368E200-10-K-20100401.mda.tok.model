item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements for the year ended december  the application of these policies requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on a combination of historical experience and reasonable judgment applied to other facts 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
in addition  the use of different assumptions or judgments may result in different estimates 
we believe our critical accounting policies that are subject to these estimates are revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves we defer revenue recognition on products sold to distributors until our distributors sell the products to their customers  because our distributors generally have rights to return products to us for stock rotation  stock reduction  or replacement of defective product 
the amount of deferred revenue net of related cost of revenue is classified as deferred income on shipments to distributors on our balance sheet 
we use inventory reports received from our distributors at the end of each reporting period to determine the extent of inventory at the distributor  and thus  the amount of income to defer 
stock rotation and stock reduction from our distributors generally results in a balance sheet adjustment to our deferred income and does not impact our revenue or cost of revenue 
we generally recognize revenues on sales to customers other than distributors upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
most of our customers other than distributors do not have rights of return except under warranty 
we also earn revenue from an extended warranty service program offered on select products 
revenues from the extended warranty service program are recognized ratably over the life of the extended warranty contract 
the amount of unrecognized warranty service revenue is classified as deferred service revenue and presented on our balance sheet in its short and long term components 
we also earn revenue from services performed in connection with consulting arrangements 
for those contracts that include contract milestones or acceptance criteria we recognize revenue as such milestones are achieved or as such acceptance occurs 
in some instances the acceptance criteria in the contract requires acceptance after all services are complete and all other elements have been delivered  in which case revenue recognition is deferred until those requirements are met 
we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance  historical trends  and communications with our customers 
if actual bad debts are significantly different from our estimates our operating results will be affected 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventories primarily consist of component parts used to assemble our products after we receive orders from our customers 
we purchase or have manufactured the component parts required by our engineering bill of materials 
the timing and quantity of our purchases are based on order forecasts  the lead time requirements of our vendors  and on economic order quantities 
at the end of each reporting period  we compare our inventory on hand to our forecasted requirements for the next nine month period  and write off the cost of any inventory that is surplus  less any amounts that we believe we can recover from disposal of goods that we specifically believe will be saleable past a nine month horizon 
our sales forecasts are based upon historical trends  communications from customers  and marketing data regarding market trends and dynamics  which we discuss in item  business 
surplus or obsolete inventory can also be created by changes to our engineering bill of materials 
charges for the amounts we record as surplus or obsolete inventory are included in cost of revenue 
stock based compensation on january   we began accounting for share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements based on the fair values of the share based awards 
we use a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants made on or after january  the binomial lattice model incorporates calculations for expected volatility  risk free interest rates  employee exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior  and these factors affect the estimate of the fair value of the stock option grants 
we use a black scholes valuation model for options granted prior to january  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a two step test is required to be performed to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a determination of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step involves an analysis reflecting the allocation of fair value determined in the first step as if it was the purchase price in a business combination 
this process may result in the determination of a new amount of goodwill 
if the calculated fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit  the difference is reflected as a non cash impairment loss 
the purpose of the second step is only to determine the amount of goodwill that should be recorded on the balance sheet 
the recorded amounts of other items on the balance sheet are not adjusted 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill testing 
we estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit utilizing up to three valuation methods market capitalization  income approach and market approach 
revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performance 
we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

table of contents revenues our revenues have been classified into three broad product families for the years ended december    and  and are presented in the following table revenues in thousands years ended december  increase decrease in years vs 
vs 
product family s s s s s s mobile handheld computer products mobile peripheral products data collection connectivity serial interface oem embedded products total our mobile handheld computer product revenues in increased by million from mobile handheld computer product revenues in we began shipping our first mobile handheld computer  the somo  to customers through our distribution channel in the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we completed our objectives of ramping up production and fully stocking our distribution channel to enable the commencement of widespread customer evaluation  qualification  and deployment 
we began offering windows mobile classic and multiple language support for the somo in the second quarter of  giving customers a choice of operating systems and languages to best fit their needs 
in late  we introduced the somo rx with an antimicrobial case for the healthcare market designed to reduce the risk of the spread of bacteria from the use of handheld devices in a healthcare environment  and the somo dx without bluetooth or wireless lan for high security environments 
increased revenues in from our mobile handheld computer products reflect higher sales volumes due to a growing customer base with larger average unit deployments 
although the annual revenues in indicate growth in our mobile handheld computer revenues  we believe this growth has been slowed by the worldwide economic slowdown  as our customers are taking longer to make their deployment decisions 
in the second half of mobile handheld computer revenues declined by compared to the first half of due to the completion of a year long roll out to a key customer in the healthcare market early in the third quarter 
declines in sales to this key customer in the second half of were partially offset by growth in sales to existing customers in healthcare and other markets  which grew at a rate of in the second half of compared to the first half 
our mobile handheld computer product revenues in increased by million from mobile handheld computer product revenues in increased revenues for our mobile handheld computer products in reflect higher sales volumes due to a growing customer base with larger average unit deployments compared to  and due to the fact that we did not start recognizing revenue for these products until the second quarter of 
table of contents our data collection product revenues in decreased by million from data collection revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million in sales of our compactflash in hand scan card product  a decline of million in sales of our cordless hand scanner  a decline million in reduced sales of our sdio in hand scan card  and a decline in sales of our cordless ring scanner 
revenue declines in were due primarily to lower sales volumes of these primary scanning products due to the effects of the worldwide economic slowdown which began in the fourth quarter of our data collection product revenues in decreased by million from data collection revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million in sales of our compactflash in hand scan card product  a decline of million in sales of our cordless hand scanner  and a decline million in reduced sales of our cordless ring scanner and our sdio in hand scan card 
data collection revenues in were slowed in the first quarter but began to recover in the second quarter due in part to delayed availability of new handheld computer models originally announced by a major handheld computer manufacturer in the third quarter of  which did not begin shipping until february such announcements and delayed timing of product availability typically slow customer deployments of our peripheral products because of the time needed by customers to evaluate or adopt the new handheld computer models 
following this revenue recovery was the fourth quarter of  in which data collection product sales were adversely affected by the worldwide economic slowdown beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout our connectivity product revenues for the three years presented in the above table consist of ethernet plug in cards  modems  and accessory products including our mobile power pack  adapters and cables 
connectivity product revenues in decreased by million from connectivity product revenues in the decrease was due primarily to a decline of million from reduced sales of our modem plug in products with remaining declines from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
connectivity product revenues in decreased by million from connectivity product revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million from reduced sales of our modem plug in products and a decline of million from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
overall connectivity product revenues have declined in the periods presented  reflecting a trend of year over year reductions in corporate deployments of these wired connection solutions 
most users of mobile computing devices now connect to networks wirelessly  and we expect to phase out our connectivity products during our serial interface product revenues declined in by million from revenues in  and in declined by million from revenues in the decrease in was primarily from declines of million in sales of our standard serial pc card products with additional declines due to lower sales of our bluetooth serial adapter product  which were due in part to the sale of our serial product line to quatech  inc on september  see note sale of product line assets for more information 
our standard serial pc card products were primarily sold to connect peripheral devices or other electronic equipment to notebook computers 
in  half of the decline was from lower sales of our compactflash serial card products 
additional declines in were due to lower sales of our standard serial pc card products and cordless bluetooth serial adapter product 
overall serial product revenues have declined in the periods presented  continuing a trend reflecting the gradual replacement of serial technology with usb and other newer connection technologies 

table of contents our oem embedded product revenues declined in by million from revenues in  and in increased by million from revenues in revenue decreases of million in were from reduced sales of our bluetooth modules to our oem customers as a result of phasing out older bluetooth technology and a last buy purchase program 
our oem customers made last buy bluetooth module purchases beginning in the third quarter of  with the majority of these shipments occurring in the latter half of  followed by the final remaining shipments completed primarily in the first quarter of additional declines in of million were from reductions in sales of our wireless lan plug in cards 
remaining declines in were from reduced sales of our bluetooth plug in cards  a trend that continued from  reflecting lower overall requirements for these products by our oem customer group and the availability of this wireless technology already built into handheld computers to our non oem customers 
partially offsetting these declines in were increases of million in sales of our wireless lan modules 
revenue increases in of million were from increased sales of our bluetooth modules due to a recovery in market conditions that existed in early  and the last buy purchases of bluetooth modules in the latter half of  already discussed above 
in the first quarter of our oem customers in the industrial ruggedized market segment experienced pronounced increased competition due to a short term aggressive price discounting begun in the fourth quarter by a major competitor  a trend which adversely affected our related bluetooth module revenues in the first quarter of  but improved steadily in the following quarters of and throughout  following cessation of the aggressive discounting by the competitor 
additional revenue increases in of million were from increased sales of our wireless lan plug in cards reflecting a shift in our customer base for this product towards customers within our oem customer group in need of this wireless technology and away from non oem customers for whom availability of this wireless technology was increasingly already built in by handheld computer manufacturers 
gross margins gross margins for were percent of revenues compared to gross margins of percent in and in we generally price our products as a markup from our cost  and we offer discount pricing for higher volume purchases 
reductions in overall margins in were due primarily to increased sales of our mobile handheld computer which comprised of our revenues in compared to in margins on our mobile handheld computer are below our average product margins 
additional margin declines in are due to our fixed overhead costs  which comprise a greater portion of the overall revenues and cost of goods sold due to lower revenues in compared to reductions in overall margins in are due primarily to discounts we granted on volume purchases of our bluetooth modules by customers in our oem embedded business segment  and increased sales of our mobile handheld computer which began shipping late in the second quarter of research and development expense research and development expense in was million  a decrease of percent from research and development expense in of million 
research and development expense in was million  a decrease of percent from research and development expense in of million 
sixty three percent of the reduction in research and development expense in was due to reduced personnel costs as the result of a reduction in force action initiated in the fourth quarter of  followed by additional reductions in employee compensation and related expense in in the fourth quarter of the company initiated a range of expense reductions across all departments and functional expense categories in response to the worldwide economic slowdown  with additional reductions following in the first and second quarters of  and a continuation of the reduced expense levels throughout the remaining quarters of additional reductions in research and development expense in were from decreases in development fees due to a reduction in product development activities  and decreases in equipment costs related to the reductions in product development activities 
decreases of million in were attributable to the costs incurred in the first quarter of related to the development of our somo mobile handheld computer  the development of which was begun in the fourth quarter of  with the majority of the development expense concluded by the end of the first quarter of additional decreases in of million were from reductions in consulting and professional fees related to fewer projects requiring the use of external technical expertise  and from reductions in equipment costs due to higher amounts of depreciation expense related to capitalized tooling in the first quarter of we will continue to monitor our research and development expense in in response to the current economic conditions 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in was million  a decrease of percent compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
sales and marketing expense in increased by percent compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
seventy five percent of the reduction in sales and marketing expense in was due to reduced personnel costs as a result of the reduction in force action initiated in the fourth quarter of referred to above and further reductions in employee compensation and related expense during additional reductions in sales and marketing expense in were in the categories of advertising and promotion expense  travel  outside services  and equipment costs 
increases in were primarily from increased personnel costs of million due to the additions of key personnel beginning in the second quarter of  including a senior sales executive and additional salespersons in north america to begin selling our new somo mobile handheld computer  which began shipping late in the second quarter of  and from expenses relating to the recruitment and development of new third party channel partners 
additional increases in were from higher levels of advertising and promotional expenses  offset by reductions in outside services and travel expenses 
we will continue to monitor our sales and marketing expense in in response to the current economic conditions 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in was million  a decrease of percent compared to general and administrative expense of million in general and administrative expense in decreased by percent compared to general and administrative expense in of million 
over half of the reduction in expense in was due to decreases in payroll costs primarily from reductions in employee compensation expense for the year 
additional reductions in general and administrative expense were primarily from decreases in consulting and professional fees and reduced investor relations expense 
decreases in were primarily from reduced stock based compensation expenses as older grants with higher valuations compared to more current grants  became fully expensed 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher overall occupancy related costs compared to we will continue to monitor our general and administrative expense in in response to the current economic conditions 

table of contents amortization of intangibles in july we acquired a patent which covers the design and functioning of plug in bar code scanners  bar code imagers  and radio frequency identification products 
the patent was purchased for  and has been capitalized as an intangible asset 
the patent is being amortized on a straight line basis over a ten year period 
intangible assets of  remaining from a prior acquisition in consisted of developed software and technology with estimated lives at the time of acquisition of years 
such amount has now been fully amortized 
at december   a licensing agreement with a book value of  was reclassified as an intangible asset and was amortized over its remaining life of three years ending in december total amortization charges in for all acquired intangibles were  compared to  in  and  in the lower annual amortization charges are due to components of intangible property becoming fully amortized 
future intangible amortization charges are solely related to the patent acquired in  and will be  per quarter going forward until fully amortized 
goodwill impairment goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of september th or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our single reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
based on indicators in the fourth quarter of we are performing additional impairment testing with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
we are using the two step test as required to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test consisted of comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
we estimated the fair value of the company using various methods and compared the fair value to the carrying amount net book value to ascertain if potential goodwill impairment existed 
we utilized methods that focused on our ability to produce income income approach and the estimated consideration we would receive if there were a sale of the company market approach 
key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value in step one of the test included the following our market capitalization  market multiples of comparable companies within our industry  revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation were based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performance  cash flows utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimated using a weighted average cost of capital determined to be appropriate for our company 
based on the fair value estimated in step one  we determined a step one failure occurred which indicated a goodwill impairment may exist 
we proceeded to the step two analyses which includes estimating the fair value of our assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the income approach is being utilized to value our identified intangible assets  including developed technology  trade name  patents  and internally developed software 
as a result of a preliminary step two of the test  the estimated fair value of our goodwill is million which exceeds the carrying value by million 
as a result  we recorded an estimated million goodwill impairment as of december  we are currently finalizing the identification and valuation of the intangible assets with the assistance of a third party specialist and any adjustment to the estimated impairment based on the completion of the step two analyses shall be recognized in the quarter ending march  
table of contents interest income and other  and interest expense interest income reflects interest earned on cash balances 
interest income in was immaterial compared to interest income of  in and  in lower interest income in the comparable periods reflects lower average cash balances combined with lower average rates of return 
interest expense was  in compared to  in and  in interest expense is related to interest on equipment lease financing obligations and interest on amounts drawn on our bank lines of credit  and in and also included interest related to a term loan outstanding 
higher interest expense in is due to higher average balances outstanding on our bank lines of credit at higher overall interest rates 
beginning in june our credit line agreements included a requirement that we maintain a minimum of million in cash on hand  and consequently we maintained higher average balances on our credit line in order to comply with this requirement 
higher interest expense in was due to higher average balances outstanding on our bank lines of credit partially offset by lower interest rates  and higher average amounts outstanding on our bank term loan compared to beginning in the second quarter of  average amounts outstanding on our bank lines of credit increased from prior quarters levels 
prior to the second quarter of we used our bank lines of credit only at the end of each quarter 
the term loan was made at the end of the second quarter of and was being repaid in monthly installments beginning in july of until repaid in full in december in conjunction with a new credit line agreement at that time 
income taxes deferred income tax reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
a reversal of deferred tax expense of  in was related to the impairment charges on the portion of our goodwill being amortized for tax purposes 
deferred tax expense of  in and  and the corresponding deferred tax liability shown on our balance sheet  was related entirely to the deferred tax liability on the portion of our goodwill amortized for tax purposes 
due to the indefinite characteristic of this deferred tax liability in and  it could not be offset against deferred tax assets 
we maintain a full valuation allowance for all other components of deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that the deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance will be realized 
we have not generated taxable income in any periods in any jurisdiction  foreign or domestic 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth summary quarterly statements of operations data for each of the quarters in and this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented elsewhere herein  and  in our opinion  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented

see note reverse stock split for additional information 
we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results  and we anticipate such fluctuations to continue in the future 
we generally ship orders as received and therefore quarterly revenue and operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of the quarter 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for our products  the size and timing of customer orders  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  product mix  timing of software enhancements  changes in the level of operating expenses  and competitive conditions in the industry 
because our staffing and other operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a substantial portion of which is not typically generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources we were profitable in the third quarter of due in part to the gain on the sale of our serial product line assets 
we were unprofitable in each of other three quarters of  unprofitable for fiscal year  and unprofitable in each of the quarters in fiscal years   and we were profitable in two quarters in  but unprofitable for fiscal year fiscal year was the only profitable year in our history  and only to the extent of  prior to  we incurred significant operating losses in each financial period since our inception 
we may continue to be unprofitable in the foreseeable future 
historically we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  equipment financing  and revolving bank lines of credit 
since our inception we have raised approximately million in equity capital to fund our operations 

table of contents as reflected in our statements of cash flows  net cash provided from operating activities was million in compared to million used in operating activities in  and million used in operating activities in we calculate net cash used in operating activities by reducing our net loss million  million  and million in   and  respectively by those expenses that did not require the use of cash  and reversing gains that did not generate cash 
these items consist of stock based compensation expense  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  changes in inventory reserves  changes in deferred rent  deferred tax expense  and in a reversal of deferred tax expense 
these amounts totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
also  in our net loss includes a gain of  from the sale of our serial product line assets in september of see note sale of product line assets for more information and goodwill impairment charges of million 
we adjusted the net loss for to exclude this gain and the impairment charges 
reductions in non cash items in were primarily from the deferred tax expense reversal related to the impairment charges on the portion of our goodwill being amortized for tax purposes  reductions in amortization expense due to components of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized and reductions in foreign currency losses partially offset by an increased change in inventory reserves and deferred rent compared to non cash items in compared to were primarily from lower stock compensation expense due to older grants with higher valuations compared to more current grants becoming fully expensed  reduced depreciation expense due to lower levels of equipment and tooling purchases  and decreased inventory write downs in compared to in addition  we report increases in assets and reductions in liabilities as uses of cash and decreases in assets and increases in liabilities as sources of cash  together referred to as changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of million and were primarily from reductions in inventory due primarily to planned reductions in stocking levels of our mobile handheld computer from year end inventory levels  reductions in accounts receivable due to lower shipments in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  and increases in deferred service revenues  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable due to reductions in overall expenses and inventory purchases that create those payables  and reductions in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to lower stocking levels of our products in the distribution channel 
changes in operating assets and liabilities in were primarily from increased levels of inventories due to stocking higher quantities of our mobile handheld computer and increases in accounts receivable due to shipments concentrated in the last month of the fourth quarter of  partially offset by increases in accounts payable due to the purchases that led to the increased levels of inventories  increases in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to increased stocking levels in the domestic distribution channel  and increases in deferred service revenue 
changes in operating assets and liabilities in were primarily from increases in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to increased levels of inventory in our channel primarily from distributors stocking our new mobile handheld computer which we began shipping in june  and increases in deferred service revenue and accrued payroll  partially offset by increases in inventory and prepaid royalties related to our new mobile handheld computer 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in and million in proceeds of  from the sale of our serial product line assets in september were partially offset by cash used for equipment and tooling purchases in reductions in equipment and tooling purchases in were due to fewer development projects requiring these expenditures compared to reduced investing activities in reflects reductions in equipment and tooling purchases due to fewer development projects requiring these expenditures  and lower non recurring leasehold improvements than in remaining investing activities in each of the periods presented reflect the costs of new computer hardware and software costs 
cash provided from financing activities was million in  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in  and cash provided by financing activities of million in financing activities in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and warrants 
financing activities in consisted primarily of net amounts paid of million on our bank lines of credit and repayment of the outstanding balance of million on our term loan in december in conjunction with entering into a new credit line agreement at that time  and payments on capital leases  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totaling million 
financing activities in consisted primarily of a net increase of million in the amounts drawn on our bank lines of credit  million from a term loan advance in june net of repayments  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options

our balance sheet at december  has a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to  and no material long term debt 
we took actions beginning in the fourth quarter of to reduce our expenses  including a reduction of of our worldwide workforce  to align our cost structure with current economic conditions in light of slowing business spending due to the current economic downturn 
we took additional actions during to reduce quarterly expenses 
we have the ability to reduce expenses further if necessary 

table of contents the report of the independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding certain conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these conditions include continuing operating losses  declines in our working capital balances and our failure to achieve the revenue levels required to maintain compliance with our bank line covenants 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to establish profitable operations and to raise additional financing 
we have been taking steps intended to reduce operating losses and achieve profitability including the introduction of new products  continued close support of our distributors and of our application partners as they establish their mobile applications in key vertical markets  and management of our costs 
we believe that we will be able to improve liquidity and secure additional sources of financing by managing our working capital balances  returning to compliance with the bank line covenants as operating results improve  and raising additional capital as needed  including development funding from development partners and through the issuance of additional equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of these steps  and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and any such terms may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
our inability to secure and maintain the necessary liquidity will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to secure the necessary capital for our business  we may need to suspend some or all of our current operations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
if we can return to revenue growth and attain profitability  we anticipate requirements for cash will include funding of higher receivable and inventory balances  and increased expenses  including more employees to support our growth and increases in salaries  benefits  and related support costs for employees 
our contractual obligations at december  are outlined in the table shown below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years capital leases operating leases bank line of credit unconditional purchase obligations with contract manufacturers total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item of regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the securities and exchange commission sec issued release no 
 interactive data to improve financial reporting 
the final rule requires companies to provide their financial statements and financial statement schedules to the sec and on their corporate websites in interactive data format using the extensible business reporting language xbrl 
the rule was adopted by the sec to improve the ability of financial statement users to access and analyze financial data 
the sec adopted a phase in schedule indicating when registrants must furnish interactive data 
under this schedule  we will be required to submit filings with financial statement information using xbrl commencing with our june  quarterly report on form q 
we are currently evaluating the impact of xbrl reporting on our financial reporting process 

table of contents effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles formerly sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 

this standard establishes only two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative 
the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards codification the codification became the source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
we began using the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of fiscal as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  vendor objective evidence voe or third party evidence tpe is unavailable 
this guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
full retrospective application of the guidance is optional 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance which amends the scope of existing software revenue recognition accounting 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality would be scoped out of the accounting guidance on software and accounted for based on other appropriate revenue recognition guidance 
this guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
full retrospective application of the new guidance is optional 
this guidance must be adopted in the same period that we adopt the amended accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables described in the preceding paragraph 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance which clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements related to recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
we must implement these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal certain additional disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measures are not effective until fiscal years beginning after december  other than requiring additional disclosures  implementation of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to invested cash 
our cash is invested in short term money market investments backed by us treasury notes and other investments that mature within one year and whose principal is not subject to market rate fluctuations
