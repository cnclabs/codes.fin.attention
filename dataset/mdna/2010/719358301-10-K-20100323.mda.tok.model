item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction  outlook and overview of business operations for financial reporting purposes  we view our current business as comprised of the following five business segments domestic xtrac  international dermatology equipment  skin care procyte  photo therapeutics ptl  and surgical products 
domestic xtrac our domestic xtrac segment is a us based business with revenues generally derived from procedures performed by dermatologists 
we are engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of our proprietary xtrac excimer laser and delivery systems and techniques used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders  including psoriasis  vitiligo  atopic dermatitis and leukoderma 
as part of our commercialization strategy in the united states  we generally offer the xtrac laser system to targeted dermatologists at no initial capital cost 
under this contractual arrangement  we maintain ownership of the laser and generally earn revenue each time a physician treats a patient with the equipment 
we believe this arrangement will increase market penetration 
we also may sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference and especially now as a means of addressing under performing accounts while still preserving a vendor customer relationship 
we believe that we are thus able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the laser market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
for the last several years we have sought to obtain health insurance coverage for xtrac laser therapy to treat inflammatory skin disease  particularly psoriasis 
we now benefit from the fact that  by our estimates  more than of the insured united states population has policies that provide nearly full reimbursement for the treatment of psoriasis by means of an excimer laser 
we are currently restructuring sales and marketing efforts in business segments that have previously been dependent upon external infusions of debt capital to fund growth 
international dermatology equipment in the international market  we derive revenues by selling our dermatology laser and lamp systems and replacement parts to distributors and directly to physicians 
in this market  we have benefited from both our clinical studies and from the improved reliability and functionality of the xtrac laser system 
compared to the domestic segment  the sales of laser and lamp systems in the international segment are influenced to a greater degree by competition from similar laser technologies as well as non laser lamp alternatives 
over time  this competition has reduced the prices we are able to charge to international distributors for our xtrac products 
to compete with other non laser uvb products  we offer a lower priced  lamp based system called the vtrac 
we have expanded the international marketing of the vtrac since its introducti on in the vtrac is used to treat psoriasis and vitiligo 
we are realigning the management of this segment 
globalmed will generally manage our international device sales 
skin care procyte our skin care segment generates revenues primarily from the sale of skin health  hair care and wound care products 
our focus has been to provide unique products  primarily based upon propiretary technologies for selected applications in the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery and medical spa markets 
we have also expanded the use of our copper peptide technologies into the mass retail market for skin and hair care through targeted technology licensing and supply agreements 
our skincare products are aimed at the growing demand for skin health and hair care products  including products to enhance appearance and address the effects of aging on skin and hair 
our skincare products are formulated  branded and targeted at specific markets 
our initial products addressed the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery markets for use after various procedures 
anti aging skincare products were added to offer a comprehensive approach for a patient s skincare regimen 
in  we introduced dna topical products  which include dna nourishing lotion and dna total repair which use innovative technology to address dna damage 
we also introduced neova skin care systems  which are kits of neova products that target specific conditions with complete treatment programs 
the programs are intense age defense  ext remely clear  and essential eye recovery 
these kits are designed to make it simpler for physicians to dispense the products and to ensure patient compliance and satisfaction 
photo therapeutics ptl our ptl segment is a developer and provider of non laser light aesthetic devices for the treatment of a range of clinical and non clinical dermatological conditions 
our ptl segment has a portfolio of independent  experimental research that supports the efficacy and safety of our omnilux technology system 
based on a patented technology platform comprised of a unique light emitting diode led array  this technology delivers narrow band  spectrally pure light of specific intensity  wavelength and dose to achieve clinically proven results via a process called photo bio modulation 
since this technology generates no heat  a patient feels no pain or discomfort which results in improved regime compliance and a higher likelihood of repeat procedures  this is in direct contrast to the current laser light based technologies ser ving the aesthetics market today 
our ptl led products compete in the professional aesthetics device market for led aesthetic medical procedures 
in addition  we have recently developed a line of consumer devices to address the home use market opportunity 
the fda has issued over the counter otc clearances for our two hand held consumer devices 
to date  we have incorporated our ptl technology offering into a range of products targeting both the professional based sector and the larger home use market 
therefore  our ptl segment s current portfolio of products is divided into three types professional products comprising the omnilux systems for the medical market  the lumiere systems to address the non medical professional market  and home use products to address the consumer market 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of our ptl segment from february   the date of acquisition  through december  surgical products our surgical products segment generates revenues by selling laser products and disposables to hospitals and surgery centers both within and outside of the united states 
also included in this segment are various non laser surgical products eg the clearess ii suction irrigation system 
we believe that sales of surgical laser systems and the related disposable base will tend to erode as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
we are working to offset such erosion by increasing sales from the diode surgical laser  including original equipment manufacturer oem arrangements 
in september  we entered into a three year oem agreement with angiodynamics under which we agreed to manufacture a private label  nanometer diode laser system for angiodynamics 
however  angiodynamics purchased the assets of a competitive diode laser company and has elected to source its diodes through the assets so purchased instead of through us 
we have not shipped any lasers to angiodynamics since july  galderma s metvixia and aktilite products on january   we entered into a co promotion agreement with galderma  pursuant to which our sales force will promote galderma s metvixia drug and aktilite led light for the photodynamic therapy treatment of actinic keratosis 
metvixia is a topical porphyrin precursor used in photodynamic therapy 
when applied to actinic keratosis lesions  metvixia is selectively absorbed into precancerous cells causing a build up of endogenous porphyrins 
these endogenous porphyrins are illuminated with the aktilite cl lamp emitting a narrow output spectrum of red light with a peak wavelength at nm 
subsequently  a reaction occurs that results in the destruction of the precancerous cells 
clinical trials in various countries with the metvixia pdt system have shown comparable or better response rates than conventional treatments  su ch as cryotherapy or surgery 
metvixia pdt selectively targets precancerous cells so the surrounding healthy cells are less subjected to the treatment  therein minimizing scarring and ensuring more acceptable cosmetic outcomes for patients 
clutterbuck financing on march   we entered into the clutterbuck agreement and the term note with clutterbuck funds llc 
clutterbuck funds llc  a registered investment advisor based in cleveland  ohio 
we received net proceeds of  in the transaction 
the term note has a principal amount of million  which accrues interest at a rate of per annum 
the term note requires us to make monthly payments of interest only 
the principal matures in months and may be prepaid without penalty at any time 
the note is secured by xtrac lasers that we have consigned to physician customers and that are not otherwise pledged to cit healthcare llc and life sciences capital llc pursuant to our outstanding term notes with such lenders 
in connection with the issuance of the term note to clutterbuck  we issued clutterbuck funds a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock for an initial exercise price of 
the warrant is exercisable at any time on or prior to the fifth anniversary of its issue date 
pursuant to the terms of the warrant  the exercise price is subject to a one time downward adjustment if we make certain issuances of our equity securities at a price per share less than during the month period following the issuance of the warrant 
sales and marketing as of december   our sales and marketing personnel consisted of full time positions 
of the sales personnel  they are directed to sales as follows in domestic xtrac  skin care and ptl and three in international dermatology equipment  international skincare and surgical products 
sale of surgical services business our surgical services segment was a fee based procedures business using mobile surgical laser equipment operated by our technicians at hospitals and surgery centers in the united states 
we decided to sell this division primarily because the growth rates and operating margins of the division had decreased as the business changed to rely more heavily upon procedures performed using equipment from third party suppliers  thereby limiting the profit potential of these services 
on august   we sold certain assets of the business  including accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  for  reverse stock split on january   we completed the reverse split of its common stock in the ratio of for our common stock began trading at the market opening on january  on a split adjusted basis 
the reverse split is intended to enable us to increase our marketability to institutional investors and to maintain our listing on the nasdaq global market  among other benefits 
as a result of the stock split  we now have  shares of common stock outstanding  taking into account the rounding up of fractional shares 
on february   we completed a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of for  whereby  once effective  every six shares of our common stock was exchanged for one share of our common stock 
our common stock began trading on nasdaq on a reverse stock split adjusted basis at the market opening on february  as of december  we had  shares of common stock outstanding on a post split basis  taking into account the rounding up of fractional shares 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  impairment of property and equipment and of intangibles  and accruals for warranty claims 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with these policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition xtrac related operations we have two distribution channels for our phototherapy treatment equipment 
we either x sell the laser through a distributor or directly to a physician or y place the laser in a physician s offices at no charge to the physician and generally charge the physician a fee for an agreed upon number of treatments 
in some cases  we and the customer stipulate to a quarterly or other periodic target of procedures to be performed  and accordingly revenue is recognized ratably over the period 
when we sell an xtrac laser to a distributor or directly to a foreign or domestic physician  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
the criteria described in the clauses i through iv are collectively referred to as the criteria 
at times  units are shipped  but revenue is not recognized until all of the criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
we ship most of our products fob shipping point  although from time to time certain customers  for example governmental customers  will insist upon fob destination 
among the factors we take into account in determining the proper time at which to recognize revenue are when title to the goods transfers and when the risk of loss transfers 
shipments to distributors or physicians that do not fully satisfy the collection criteria are recognized when invoiced amounts are fully paid or assured 
under the terms of our distributor agreements  distributors do not have a unilateral right to return any unit that they have purchased 
however  we do allow products to be returned  under warranty  by our distributors for product defects or other claims 
when we place a laser in a physician s office  we generally recognize service revenue based on the number of patient treatments performed  or purchased under a periodic commitment  by the physician 
treatments to be performed through random laser access codes that are sold to physicians free of a periodic commitment  but not yet used  are deferred and recognized as a liability until the physician performs the treatment 
unused treatments remain an obligation of ours because the treatments can only be performed on our equipment 
once the treatments are delivered to a patient  this obligation has been satisfied 
we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to our customers within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers 
our management believes this approach closely approximates the actual number of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the years ended december  and  we deferred  and  respectively  under this approach 
skin care operations we generate revenues from our skin care business primarily through product sales for skin health  hair care and wound care 
we recognize revenues on the products and copper peptide compound when they are shipped  net of returns and allowances 
we ship the products fob shipping point 
photo therapeutics operations we generate revenues from our photo therapeutics business primarily from two channels 
the first is through product sales of leds and skincare products 
the second is through milestone payments and potential royalty payments from a licensing agreement 
we recognize revenues from the product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the criteria have been met 
we recognize the milestone payments when the milestones have been achieved and potential royalty revenues as they are earned from the licensee 
surgical products and service operations we generate revenues from our surgical products business primarily from product sales of laser systems  related maintenance service agreements  recurring laser delivery systems and laser accessories 
domestic sales generally are direct to the end user  though we have some sales to or through a small number of domestic distributors  foreign sales are to distributors 
we recognize revenues from surgical laser and other product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the criteria have been met 
revenue from maintenance service agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
revenue from billable services  including repair activity  is recognized when the service is provided 
inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is determined to be purchased cost for raw materials and the production cost materials  labor and indirect manufacturing cost for work in process and finished goods 
throughout the laser manufacturing process  the related production costs are recorded within inventory 
work in process is immaterial  given the typically short manufacturing cycle  and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials 
we perform full physical inventory counts for xtrac and cycle counts on the other inventory to maintain controls and obtain accurate data 
our xtrac laser is either i sold to distributors or physicians directly or ii placed in a physician s office and remains our property 
the cost to build a laser  whether for sale or for placement  is accumulated in inventory 
when a laser is placed in a physician s office  the cost is transferred from inventory to lasers in service within property and equipment 
at times  units are shipped to distributors  but revenue is not recognized until all of the criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
revenue is not recognized from these distributors until payment is either assured or paid in full 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves periodically based on forecasted sales and market trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the majority of receivables related to phototherapy sales are due from various distributors located outside of the united states and from physicians located inside the united states 
the majority of receivables related to skincare products and surgical products are due from various customers and distributors located inside the united states 
from time to time  our customers dispute the amounts due to us  and  in other cases  our customers experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectible accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectible accounts involves significant judgment 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
property and equipment 
as of december  and  we had net property and equipment of  and  respectively 
the most significant component of these amounts relates to the xtrac lasers placed by us in physicians offices 
we own the equipment and charge the physician on a per treatment basis for use of the equipment 
the recoverability of the net carrying value of the lasers is predicated on continuing revenues from the physicians use of the lasers 
if the physician does not generate sufficient treatments  then we may remove the laser from the physician s office and redeploy elsewhere 
xtrac lasers placed in service are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years 
f or other property and equipment  including property and equipment acquired from procyte  depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  primarily three to seven years for computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or lease terms 
useful lives are determined based upon an estimate of either physical or economic obsolescence  or both 
goodwill and intangibles assets 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on various factors  including market conditions and operational performance of our business 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for and of our total assets at the respective dates 
the goodwill is not amortizable  the other intangibles are 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test our goodwill for impairment  at least annually 
this test is usually conducted in december of each year in connection with the annual budgeting and forecast process 
also  on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether events have occurred that would negatively impact the realizable value of our intangibles or goodwill 
for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing  our reporting units are defined as domestic xtrac  international dermatology equipment and skin care 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of december  our assessment did not result in good will impairment 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
th e balance of our goodwill for each of our segments as of december  is as follows domestic xtrac  international dermatology equipment  and skin care  of the three reporting units with goodwill  international dermatology equipment has a fair value that is significantly in excess of its carrying value by approximately  while skin care has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
the third reporting unit  domestic xtrac has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our actual results and or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
in connection with the acquisition of photo therapeutics on february   we acquired certain intangibles recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and allocated them fully to the photo therapeutics segment 
the balances of these acquired intangibles  net of amortization  were december  ptlcustomer relationships ptl tradename ptl patented technologies goodwill total derivative financial instruments 
we recognize all derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measures them at fair value with changes in fair value reflected as current period income or loss unless the derivatives qualify as hedges 
as a result  certain warrants are now accounted for as derivatives 
as of december   we had  in derivative financial instruments 
fair value measurements 
we measure fair value in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic 
asc topic defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants wo uld use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions there exists a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
our derivative financial instruments are considered to be significant unobservable inputs level 
deferred income taxes 
we have a deferred tax asset that is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
we have not recognized the deferred tax asset  given our historical losses and the lack of certainty of future taxable income 
however  if and when we become profitable and can reasonably foresee continuing profitability  then under fasb asc  income taxes asc topic we may recognize some of the deferred tax asset 
the recognized portion may variously reduce acquired goodwill  increase stockholders equity directly and or benefit the statement of operations 
warranty accruals 
we establish a liability for warranty repairs based on estimated future claims for xtrac systems and based on historical analysis of the cost of the repairs for surgical laser systems 
however  future returns of defective laser systems and related warranty liability could differ significantly from estimates  and historical patterns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations revenues the following table illustrates revenues from our five business segments for the periods listed below for the year ended december  dermatology xtrac domestic services international dermatology equipment products skin care products photo therapeutics ptl products total dermatology revenues surgical surgical products total surgical revenues total revenues revenues from our surgical services segment  in the amount of  through august   the date of sale  have been accounted for in as a discontinued operation 
revenues from our surgical services segment were  for the year ended december  were reclassified to discontinued operations 
domestic xtrac segment recognized treatment revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively  reflecting billed procedures of   and  respectively 
in addition    and  procedures were performed for the years ended december   and  respectively  without billing from us  in connection with clinical research and customer evaluations of the xtrac laser 
the increase in procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same periods in and was largely related to our increased marketing programs 
increases in procedures are dependent upon building market acceptance through marketing programs with our physician partners and their patients that the xtrac procedures will be o f clinical benefit and be generally reimbursed 
we have a program to support certain physicians who may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers for xtrac treatments 
we recognize service revenue during this program from the sale of xtrac procedures or equivalent treatments to physicians participating in this program only to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues of  procedures net  under this program  compared to deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program 
the change in deferred revenue under this program is presented in the table below 
we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to the customer within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers 
management believes this approach closely approximates the actual amount of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the year ended december   we recognized net revenues of   procedures and for the year ended december   we deferred net revenues of   procedures  respectively  under this approach 
for the year ended december   we deferred net revenues of  procedures under this approach 
for the years ended december  and  domestic xtrac laser sales were  and  respectively 
there were and lasers sold  respectively 
included in the year ended december  laser sales was a sale of one omnilux product from ptl for which we had been acting as a distributor in the united states 
there were xtrac lasers sold for the year ended december  for a total of  we sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference as well as a means of addressing under performing accounts while preserving the vendor customer relationship 
we believe that we are able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the laser market that is better suited to a sa le model than a per procedure  or consignment  model 
the following table illustrates the above analysis for the domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  total revenue less laser sales revenue recognized treatment revenue change in deferred program revenue change in deferred unused treatments net billed treatment revenue procedure volume total less non billed procedures net billed procedures avg 
price of treatments sold change in procedures with deferred program revenue  net change in procedures with deferred unused treatments  net the average price for a treatment may be reduced in some instances based on the volume of treatments performed 
the average price for a treatment also varies based upon the mix of mild and moderate psoriasis patients treated by our physician partners 
we charge a higher price per treatment for moderate psoriasis patients due to the increased body surface area required to be treated  although there are fewer patients with moderate psoriasis than there are with mild psoriasis 
international dermatology equipment segment international sales of our xtrac and vtrac systems and related parts were  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we sold systems in the year ended december  which compared to and systems in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average price of dermatology equipment sold internationally varies due to the quantity mix of refurbished domestic xtrac systems and vtracs sold 
both of these products have lower average selling prices than new xtrac laser systems 
however  by adding these to our product offerings along with expanding into new geographic territories where the products are sold  we have been able to increase overall international dermatology equipment revenues 
we sell refurbished domestic xtrac laser systems into the international market 
the selling price for used equipment is substantially less than new equipment  some of which may be substantially depreciated in connection with its use in the domestic market 
we sold of these used lasers in the year ended december  at an average price of  we sold and five of these used lasers  at an average price of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and in addition to the xtrac laser system both new and used we sell the vtrac  a lamp based  alternative uvb light source that has a wholesale sales price that is substantially below our competitors international dermatology equipment and below our xtrac laser 
in the years ended december   and  we sold  and vtrac systems  respectively 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the international dermatology equipment segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues less part sales laser lamp revenues laser lamp systems sold average revenue per laser lamp skin care segment for the year ended december   skin care revenues were  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  these revenues are generated from the sale of various skin  hair care and wound products and from the sale of copper peptide compound 
the product sales decreased for the year ended december  due to the macro economic conditions and to transitioning from our discontinued md lash factor eyelash conditioning product to our internally developed neova advanced essential lash eyelash conditioner  which launched february  this segment is more susceptible to such economic conditions than our other segments because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
product sales for the year ended december  were approximately million down from approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in product sales for the year ended december  were  of revenues from md lash factor as part of an exclusive license to distribute in the united states 
in there were  of revenues as the product was launched in august we discontinued marketing md lash factor as of january  under the terms of an agreement with allergan  inc in settlement of certain patent litigation  and we have replaced it with our own peptide based conditioner 
for the year ended december   we sold  of our neova advanced essential lash 
bulk compound sales decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bulk compound sales decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  minimum contractual royalties from neutrogena expired in november and as such the royalties decreased by  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the following table illustrates the key changes in the skin care segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product sales bulk compound sales royalties total skin care revenue photo therapeutics ptl segment for the year ended december   our ptl segment s revenues were  since ptl was acquired on february   there were no corresponding revenues for the years ended december  and ptl revenues are primarily generated from the sale of led devices and milestone payments on a licensing agreement targeting the mass consumer acne market 
the following table illustrates the key changes in our ptl segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product revenues licensing revenues total ptl revenues we are actively seeking distribution channels to reach the home use consumer market with our new u hand held led device 
licensing revenues are from a license of the clear u  which the licensee intends to use as a platform to attempt to address the mass consumer acne market 
we expect that the platform product may be released in early surgical products segment revenues from our surgical products segment include revenues derived from the sales of surgical laser systems together with sales of related laser fibers and laser disposables 
laser fibers and laser disposables are more profitable than laser systems  but the sales of laser systems generate subsequent recurring sales of fibers and disposables 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease in the year was mainly related to the termination of an oem contract in with angiodynamics 
in the second half of  angiodynamics elected not to continue with the oem contract 
sales to angiodynamics were for the year ended december  sales to angiodynamics were million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the change in average price per laser between the periods  as set forth in the table below  was largely due to the mix of lasers sold and partly due to the trade level at which the lasers were sold ie wholesale versus retail 
our diode laser has replaced our nd yag laser  which had a substantially higher sales price 
included in laser sales during the years ended december   and were sales of  and diode lasers  respectively 
the diode lasers have lower sales prices than our other types of lasers 
we are phasing out our holmium and co laser systems 
fiber and other disposables sales decreased with the comparable years ended december  and we expect that our disposables base will continue to erode over time as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
the following table illustrates the key changes in our surgical products segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues percent decrease increase laser systems sold laser system revenues average revenue per laser cost of revenues our cost of revenues are comprised of product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues 
within product cost of revenues are the costs of products sold in our international dermatology equipment segment  the skin care segment with royalties included in the services side of the segment  our ptl segment with licensing revenues included in the services side of the segment and our surgical products segment with laser maintenance fees included in the services side of this segment 
product costs also include xtrac domestic laser sales 
within services cost of revenues are the costs associated with the domestic xtrac segment  excluding the laser sales  as well as costs associated with the above referenced royalties  licensing and maintenance revenues 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  decrease is due to decreases in product cost of sales for surgical products of  related to the decrease in laser sales  a decrease in skincare products of  resulting from the switch to our internally produced neova product and a decrease in domestic xtrac laser sales of  these decreases were partly offset  by an increase in international dermatology equipment sales in the amount of  in addition  there was an increase due to the inclusion of  in product costs for our ptl business 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  is due to product cost increases from the following business segments domestic xtrac of  international dermatology equipment of  surgical products of  and skin care of  the increases are primarily a result of the increased number of laser sales which have a higher cost percentage than non laser products 
the skin care increase is the result of third party licensed products which have a higher cost 
there were also increases to the excess and obsolete inventory reserves mainly in the surgical product segment   and skin care segment   warranty expense  which is included in cost of goods sold  amounted to  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing an increase of  the increase is directly related to the increase in our domestic xtrac segment costs of  services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing an increase of  the increase is directly related to the increase in our domestic xtrac segment costs of certain allocable xtrac manufacturing overhead costs are charged against the xtrac service revenues 
our manufacturing facility in carlsbad  california is used exclusively for the production of the xtrac lasers 
the unabsorbed costs are allocated to the domestic xtrac and the international dermatology equipment segments based on actual production of lasers for each segment 
included in these allocated manufacturing costs are unabsorbed labor and direct plant costs 
the following table illustrates the key changes in cost of revenues for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product xtrac domestic international dermatology equipment skin care ptl surgical products total product costs services xtrac domestic surgical products total services costs total costs of revenues gross profit analysis gross profit decreased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in gross profit increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the following table analyzes changes in our gross margin for the periods reflected below company profit analysis for the year ended december  revenues percent decrease increase cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage the primary reasons for changes in gross profit and the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  compared to the same period in were as follows our skin care segment is more susceptible to the macro economic conditions than our other segments because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
product sales for the year ended december  were approximately million down from approximately million for the year ended december  our skin care margins are substantially higher than the other business segments and consequently substantive swings in the revenues attributed to skin care s sales will have a significant impact on our overall margins 
in our surgical products segment there were fewer laser systems sold in the year ended december  than in the comparable period of this included sales due to our oem arrangement  but in the second half of  angiodynamics elected out of the oem contract 
since that time  our sales to angiodynamics have been additionally  the higher manufacturing levels in caused better absorption of fixed overheads which lowered average unit costs and resulted in a higher gross margin in compared to we sold approximately  less in domestic xtrac lasers in the year ended december  then in the comparable period of in addition  the current year sales were at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated  since they were previously placements
