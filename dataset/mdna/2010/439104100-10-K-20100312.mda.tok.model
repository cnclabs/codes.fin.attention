see page of this annual report on form k for information regarding our use of forward looking statements in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
overview as discussed in greater detail in item business  we currently engage in several service lines that are managed as one division the health information division 
in july  we combined our service lines formerly referred to as underwriting solutions and infolink  and now refer to these operations as hooper holmes services 
our health information division hid consists of the following service lines portamedic performs paramedical and medical examinations of individuals  primarily on behalf of insurance companies in connection with the offering or rating of insurance coverage mainly life insurance  along with medical examinations of health plan participants in order to provide medical information on plan members to the plan sponsors  heritage labs performs tests of blood  urine and or oral fluid specimens  primarily generated in connection with the paramedical exams and wellness screenings performed by our portamedic and health wellness services  and assembles and sells specimen collection kits  health wellness collects health information via onsite biometric screenings  self collection laboratory test kits and health risk assessments for health management companies  including wellness companies  disease management organizations and health plans  and hooper holmes services formerly underwriting solutions and infolink provides telephone interviews of insurance candidates  retrieval of medical records and inspections  risk management solutions and underwriting services for simplified issue products and products requiring full underwriting 
our core portamedic paramedical examination business accounted for approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
basis of presentation of management s discussion and analysis on june   we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our claims evaluation division ced operating segment for million and received cash payments totaling million and a million note receivable due in six equal monthly installments beginning july  we recognized a net gain on the sale of the ced of approximately million for the year ended december  on october   we completed the sale of our medicals direct group  or mdg for million and received a cash payment of million  net of closing adjustments of million 
in addition  we incurred million of expenses related to the sale 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net gain on the sale of approximately million 
our decision to sell the ced and mdg was based on several factors  including their limited ability to significantly contribute to our long term specific goals 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion of our sale of the ced and mdg 
except where specific discussion of the ced and mdg is made  our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition excludes the ced and mdg for all periods presented 
highlights and business outlook for consolidated financial performance for the year ended december   consolidated revenues totaled million  representing a decline of approximately from the prior year 
our revenues continued to decline in primarily resulting from the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the customers we serve ie life insurance industry 
while the general economy may start to improve in  we are unsure if the demand for our customers life insurance products will experience a rebound in as a result  we plan to continue to take actions to decrease our cost structure and plan to continue to closely monitor capital expenditures in although revenues declined in  our gross margin improved to  an improvement of basis points over the comparable prior year period  resulting primarily from increased pricing  productivity gains and cost reductions 
in addition  we reduced our selling  general and administrative expenses to million  representing a reduction of million  or approximately from the prior year 
as detailed in the portamedic highlights  included in s  g a expense is increased depreciation expense of approximately million for the year ended december   related to the reduction of the estimated useful life of our current customer service order tracking information technology it systems 
we generated income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   which included restructuring and other charges of approximately million and a million tax benefit from carrying back prior year net operating losses that were fully reserved 
this represents a reduction from the prior year loss from continuing operations of million  which included restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
portamedic for the year ended december   portamedic revenues decreased approximately in comparison to the prior year 
we continue to believe that achieving acceptable profitability levels will require top line revenue growth  including the reversal of past revenue declines 
although we have approvals from over of the insurance carriers in the marketplace  the number of paramedical examinations we complete on life insurance applicants continues to decline 
the rate of decline in completed examinations for the full year was compared to  with a decline in compared to  representing a slight improvement during a difficult economic period in in order to reverse our decline in completed examinations  we must achieve greater success in turning carrier approvals into unit sales at the local agent  corporate and brokerage levels 
we continue to take steps to strengthen our local sales force we are hiring more sales representatives  streamlining our sales tracking systems  improving sales training  and focusing sales incentives on increases in paramedical exams completed ie unit goals 
the market for our portamedic services has steadily declined 
for example  according to the mib life index  in there were approximately nine million applications for life insurance completed in the united states  compared to approximately million applications in notwithstanding the rate of decline in applications submitted  we believe that the market continues to offer attractive opportunities to a company that can sell its services effectively and distinguish itself from its competitors 
we have taken or are in the process of taking the following steps to increase our market share and improve top line revenue in the third quarter of  we introduced a new appointment scheduling option called instant scheduling 
it allows insurance agents  while completing the policy application with the applicant  to immediately schedule the examination utilizing our centralized scheduling center 
the new process significantly reduces the cycle time of policy application to policy issuance  which benefits the applicant  agent broker and insurance carrier 
in  we expect to deploy a new electronic system for capturing paramedical exam information which will utilize wireless electronic devices  linked to secure corporate servers 
this new e exam service will provide our customers with real time quality assurance at the time of exam 
the cycle time required for insurance carriers to process applications is also expected to be reduced 
we introduced our national broker general agency service program which includes specialized training of our field sales representatives to market to this specific distribution channel 
to serve these customers  we have implemented new case management services which link our ordering and imaging systems to many agency management tools 
in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our service offering of providing medical exam assessments to senior individuals who are enrolled in medicare advantage healthcare plans 
we provide these services utilizing our network of licensed and trained physicians  nurse practitioners and physician assistants 
the purpose of these medical assessments is to provide health insurance payors with health information on its plan members to assist in validating pricing reimbursement information  and to provide information used in quality improvement and disease management initiatives 
all of our portamedic branch offices are now utilizing managed scheduling 
as a result of implementing managed scheduling  the time required to schedule an examination has been reduced significantly relative to past procedures where examiners scheduled their own appointments with applicants 
our implementation of managed scheduling was completed during the third quarter of in an effort to improve the speed  accuracy and consistency of services provided to our portamedic customers  we decided in december to begin the development of a new customer service order tracking it system 
in utilizing our current it system  we license the software and  as such  have difficulties in quickly implementing improvements and enhancements to the software 
our new it system is expected to eliminate these difficulties and is expected to operate at a significantly lower cost and cash outlay in the future relative to our existing system 
our new customer service system is expected to cost approximately million and is scheduled for completion in mid as a result of the development of this new system  we have reduced the estimated useful life of our current it system to terminate in mid this reduction in useful life increased depreciation expense non cash charge in by approximately million 
we believe that our investment in this new customer service system will enhance the quality of service to our customers  while improving productivity and decreasing future cash outlay 
in september  we appointed a new president of portamedic with more than years experience as a senior executive in the insurance industry 
we continue to take steps to strengthen our local sales force including hiring additional sales representatives  streamlining our sales tracking systems  improving sales training  and focusing sales incentives on increases in paramedical exams completed ie unit goals 
although the number of paramedical examinations portamedic performs continues to decline  we believe that we are a market leader in the industry 
we also believe that the steps we are taking to improve our selling ability and the quality of our services will enable us to reduce the decline experienced in the last several years 
however  in market conditions are expected to remain difficult for our portamedic service line  particularly in light of the weak us economy and its negative impact on the market for life insurance  along with the related impact on our customers 
heritage labs heritage labs services consist principally of performing tests of blood  urine and or oral fluid specimens  and the assembly and sale of kits used in the collection and transportation of such specimens to its lab facility 
in  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of specimen kits 
most of heritage labs revenue originates from paramedical exam companies including portamedic  and therefore heritage labs is affected by the same negative market trends affecting portamedic  namely the decline in the number of life insurance applications 
in response  heritage labs has taken the following steps to expand its market share and increase revenues on december   we hired a new chief operating officer to oversee the operations of our heritage labs and health wellness service lines 
this individual has over years of financial and operations experience in manufacturing and distribution businesses 
we believe this is an opportunity for heritage labs and health wellness to streamline and improve distribution processes and operations  while reducing operating costs 
in january  heritage labs moved its lab facilities to a new  larger location which is expected to increase productivity and enable new service product offerings  including offerings focusing outside the paramedical exam marketplace 
in  heritage labs hired a new medical director to help improve the value added services provided to customers and to aid in gaining new business 
the main focus of the medical director has been to use sophisticated data modeling to gain a better understanding of the true mortality consequences of the laboratory tests that we provide to the insurance industry 
our objective has been to assist our clients in their ability to develop new insurance products and establish more accurate premium rating or pricing techniques using the lab mortality data that we have developed 
we have also begun to develop risk scores to help our insurance clients better understand the mortality implications between and among interactions of multiple tests related to specific disease states 
we believe that the mortality data we are providing is unique and more complex than the data being provided by our competitors 
we believe we will be able to leverage the value of the data we supply to gain new business in heritage labs continues to expand its kit assembly products and services 
heritage labs is an fda registered class i and class ii medical device assembler 
of the three laboratories providing testing services to the insurance industry  only heritage labs is licensed to assemble kits 
heritage labs is marketing a line of self collected finger stick test kits directly to customers  under the trade name appraise 
these kits test hemoglobin ac 
the hemoglobin ac test is particularly important for diabetics  who must regularly monitor their hemoglobin ac levels 
heritage labs uses two blood testing methods for hemoglobin ac  one for testing whole blood specimens and the other for testing dried blood spots 
the test kits are currently available in retail locations including wal mart  rite aid  walgreens and other locations nationwide 
while we intend for these measures to increase our market share and revenues  there can be no assurance we will achieve those results 
heritage labs revenues for the year ended december  of million decreased in comparison to the prior year period 
we believe that  through increased test kit sales and portamedic revenue improvements  we may achieve future growth at heritage labs 
in fact  fourth quarter revenue for heritage labs achieved a increase over the comparable prior year period 
health wellness our health and wellness service line  established in  recorded revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or approximately  from the prior year 
in  we completed approximately  health screenings compared to  screenings in we provided our services to health management companies in  up from companies in we have conducted screening events in every state in the us as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico 
to date  we have certified approximately  of the examiners in our network to be wellness certified examiners representing an increase of from health and wellness services include event scheduling  provision and fulfillment of all supplies eg  examination kits  blood pressure cuffs  stadiometers  scales  centrifuges  lab coats  bandages  etc 
at screening events  event management  biometric screenings height  weight  body mass index  hip  waist  neck  pulse  blood pressure  blood draws via venipuncture or finger stick  lab testing  participant and aggregate reporting  data processing and data transmission 
heritage labs does all of the testing on the samples we collect at health and wellness screenings 
our key market advantages are our ability to screen both individuals and groups in every jurisdiction in the us using a variety of screening methods 
in  we expanded the services we offer at our biometric screening events to include influenza immunization and health counseling 
we provided influenza immunizations at select biometric screening events held in late and early our health counseling services are offered in conjunction with biometric screening events and are intended to assist our customers in engaging participants in the on going health management programs they offer 
we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of the health and care management market 
however  the success of health and wellness will depend in part upon the proven success of health and care management and health and wellness initiatives 
if the return on investment in these initiatives is not sufficiently high  our health and wellness business may not reach its full potential 
notwithstanding  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity given our company s unique set of assets  including our own laboratory heritage labs  systems and personnel and access to our network of paramedical examiners 
hooper holmes services in july  we combined our product and service offerings formerly delivered by our underwriting solutions and infolink businesses into a new service line  hooper holmes services 
we combined these services in order to eliminate duplicate operations  to reduce our expenses to a level commensurate with current revenues  and better position the businesses to expand services to new and existing customers 
for the year ended december   hooper holmes services revenues decreased in comparison to the prior year 
a significant contributing factor to this decrease was reduced underwriting service revenues from several of our largest insurance company customers 
these customers experienced a substantial slowdown in their business reduced insurance applications which resulted in a significant amount of underwriting services previously outsourced to us being greatly reduced or taken back in house by customers 
also significantly contributing to the decrease in hooper holmes services revenue is a decline in our attending physician statement aps retrieval revenue as compared to this decline is attributable to the overall decrease in life insurance application activity 
throughout  we implemented cost reduction actions to bring expenses in line with our reduced revenues 
these actions included a significant reduction of staff  along with several office closures 
key financial and other metrics monitored by management in our periodic reports filed with the sec  we provide certain financial information and metrics about our businesses  and information that our management uses in evaluating our performance and financial condition 
our objective in providing this information is to help our shareholders and investors generally understand our overall performance and assess the profitability of our businesses and our prospects for future net cash flows 
in  we primarily focused on tracking our actual results relative to our forecasts and budgets  and measuring the degree of success of our efforts to align our costs with lower revenue levels 
we monitored the following metrics in the number of paramedical examinations performed by portamedic  the average revenue per paramedical examination  time service performance  from examination order to completion  the mib life index data  which represents an indicator of the level of life insurance application activity  the number of health screenings completed by our health wellness business  the number of tele interviewing underwriting reports we generate  the number of specimens tested by heritage labs  the average revenue per specimen tested  budget to actual performance at the branch level as well as in the aggregate  and customer and product line profitability 
certain of the above cited metrics are discussed in the comparative discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows 
results of operations comparative discussion and analysis of results of operations in  and the table below sets forth our revenue by service line  for the periods indicated

in addition  our revenue declined due to the consolidation closing of certain portamedic offices in and early a significant amount of portamedic volume is derived from local agents and brokers  which has been negatively impacted by the elimination of certain offices

revenues from lab kit assembly approximately of total heritage revenue in increased by in comparison to the decline in heritage labs revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to reduced demand for lab testing services resulting from fewer insurance applications processed by heritage labs customers and the loss of a significant customer in april who transferred its lab testing services to a different company s lab 
this customer generated approximately million in revenues for heritage labs in decreased revenues due to the loss of this customer have been partially offset by revenue earned from new customers in the lab testing and kit manufacturing businesses 
the decreased average revenue per specimen experienced in the year ended december  is primarily due to a reduction in the amount we charged our customers resulting from a reduction in overnight delivery costs incurred by us and passed on to our customers 
to a lesser extent  product mix also contributed to the decrease in average revenue per specimen for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
the reduced demand for heritage labs services from insurance companies is partially attributable to the reduction in the number of paramedical examinations completed by portamedic

impairment of long lived assets and goodwill intangible assets in accordance with current accounting standards  long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are to be tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
as a result of the decline in revenues during and  principally due to the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the life insurance industry in which we serve  we performed an impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
based on our analysis  we concluded that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our intangible assets primarily customer relationships  exceeded their carrying values 
as a result  no impairment was recorded on our intangible assets during and in the third quarter of  the following events and circumstances triggered an impairment evaluation of our intangible assets and goodwill declining revenues and operating profits during the second and third quarters of compared to and the expectation that this decline would continue into the fourth quarter  quarterly and year to date revenues and operating income were significantly below budget and the expectation of below budget revenues and operating income continuing for the remainder of  continued contraction of the principal markets served by the ced  and reduced revenues from three of the ced s largest customers who expanded their vendor base resulting in fewer cases referred to the ced 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment of our intangible assets 
accordingly  in the third quarter of we recorded an impairment charge totaling million in the ced 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of tradenames and customer relationships 
consistent with our accounting treatment of the ced as a discontinued operation  this charge is recorded in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  goodwill we considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on our intangible assets and concluded that we needed to test the ced reporting unit goodwill during the third quarter of the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment for the ced reporting unit 
accordingly  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of  which is recorded in income loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are attributable to restructuring charges for employee severance and office closures totaling million  and legal and other costs related to the board of director election proxy contest totaling million 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are attributable to charges related to the early termination of an agreement with the outside consultant utilized in our strategic review totaling million  severance charges related to the resignation of the former ceo of million  and restructuring charges for employee severance and office closures totaling million

operating loss from continuing operations our consolidated operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in the prior year

income taxes we have significant deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductible intangibles  capital loss carryforwards  and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe we will realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the net decrease in the valuation allowance of approximately million was primarily attributable to the expiration of a capital loss  the utilization of prior year net operating losses  offset by the current year net operating loss 
prior to the passage of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of the act  signed into law in the fourth quarter of  corporations were allowed to carryback net operating losses two years and forward years to offset taxable income 
under this new legislation  corporations can elect to carryback net operating losses incurred in either or to a profitable fifth year preceding the loss year 
the net operating loss carried back is limited to of the available taxable income for that year 
we were able to carryback approximately million of federal net operating losses incurred in to tax year and in the fourth quarter of  we filed an amended tax return to recover approximately million of federal income tax previously paid 
in february  we received million of cash related to the carryback claim  which included million of interest 
the federal tax benefit recorded in the year ended december  reflects the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses that were carried back to under the act referred to above  offset by certain state tax liabilities 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december  reflects certain state tax liabilities 
the tax benefit recorded in the year ended december  reflects a state tax benefit 
as of january  and  no amounts were recorded for unrecognized tax benefits or for the payment of interest or penalties 
furthermore  no such amounts were accrued during the years ended december  and in july  we received notification from the internal revenue service the irs that it had completed its audits of our tax returns for the years through with no adjustments 
state income tax returns for the year and forward are subject to examination

the million payment is presented within cash used by operating activities of discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net loss earnings for the year ended december  were essentially break even  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in the prior year

loan and security agreement the loan and security agreement provides us with a revolving line of credit  the proceeds of which are to be used for general working capital purposes 
under the terms of the loan and security agreement  td bank has agreed to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which  when combined with the aggregate undrawn amount of all unexpired letters of credit  does not exceed of eligible receivables as that term is defined in the loan and security agreement  provided that in no event can the aggregate amount of the revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding at any time exceed million 
the maximum aggregate face amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any time may not exceed million pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement 
borrowings of revolving credit loans shall take the form of libor rate advances with the applicable interest rate being the greater of per annum or the libor rate  plus 
in connection with the loan and security agreement  we paid closing fees of million to the lender 
we are also obligated to pay  on a monthly basis in arrears  an unused line fee usage fee equal to per annum on the difference between million and the average outstanding principal balance of cash advances under the revolving credit line plus the average daily aggregate undrawn portion of all outstanding letters of credit for the preceding month 
in addition  we are required to pay an annual loan fee of million 
during  we incurred unused fees of million 
as security for our full and timely payment and other obligations under the loan and security agreement  we have granted td bank a security interest in all of our existing and after acquired property and of our subsidiary guarantors  including our receivables which are subject to a lockbox account arrangement  inventory and equipment 
as further security  we have granted td bank a mortgage lien encumbering our corporate headquarters 
in addition  the obligations are secured under the terms of security agreements and guarantees provided by all of our subsidiaries 
the aforementioned security interest and mortgage lien are referred to herein as the collateral 
td bank  in its sole discretion based upon its reasonable credit judgment  may a establish and change reserves required against eligible receivables  b change the advance rate against eligible receivables or the fair market value of our corporate headquarters  and c impose additional restrictions on the standards of eligibility for eligible receivables  any of which could reduce the aggregate amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under the loan and security agreement 
the loan and security agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability  and that of our subsidiaries  to pay any dividends or distributions on  or purchase  redeem or retire any shares of any class of our capital stock or other equity interests  incur additional indebtedness  sell or otherwise dispose of any of our assets  other than in the ordinary course of business  create liens on our assets  enter into any sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with any of our affiliates on other than an arm s length or no less favorable basis 
the loan and security agreement contains a financial covenant  which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the loan and security agreement  measured on a trailing month basis  of no less than to as of january   and as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters thereafter 
the fixed charge coverage ratio allows for the exclusion of capital expenditures in excess of one dollar from the denominator of the calculation provided we maintain pre defined minimum cash balances at td bank on average for the days ended as of the measurement date 
as of december  and january   our average cash balance at td bank for the days then ended  exceeded the pre defined cash balance requirements  thereby allowing all capital expenditures in excess of one dollar to be excluded from the denominator of the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio measured on a trailing month period and excluding capital expenditures in excess of one dollar was to if december  were the measurement date  we would satisfy the financial covenant 
as of january   our fixed charge coverage ratio measured on a trailing month period and excluding capital expenditures in excess of one dollar was to and  as such  we satisfied the financial covenant 
however  there is no assurance that we will satisfy this financial covenant as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
on april   we obtained from td bank and issued a letter of credit under the loan and security agreement in the amount of million to the landlord of our heritage labs facility as security for performance of our obligations under the lease 
the letter of credit will automatically extend for additional periods of one year  unless notice is given to terminate the letter of credit days prior to its expiration date 
in no event shall the letter of credit be renewed beyond december  also  in december  we opened a million td visa credit card account to be used by hooper holmes services medical records retrieval service line 
the letter of credit and the credit card reduced our borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit totaled million 
the failure of us or any subsidiary guarantor to comply with any of the covenants or the breach of any of our representations and warranties contained in the loan and security agreement constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
in addition  the loan and security agreement provides that events of default include the occurrence or failure of any event or condition that  in td bank s sole judgment  could have a material adverse effect i on our business  operations  assets  management  liabilities or condition of  ii on the value of or the perfection or priority of td bank s lien upon the collateral  or iii on the ability of us and our subsidiary guarantors to perform under the loan and security agreement 
the revolving credit loans are payable in full  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  on the earlier of march  or the date of termination of the loan commitments  termination being one of the actions td bank may take upon the occurrence of an event of default 
we may prepay any revolving credit loan  in whole or in part without penalty 
we may also terminate the loan and security agreement  provided that on the date of such termination all of our obligations thereunder are paid in full 
we will be required to pay an early termination fee equal to million if the termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the date of the parties execution of the loan and security agreement  million if termination occurs after the first anniversary but prior to the second anniversary  and million if termination occurs after the second anniversary  but prior to the loan and security agreement expiration date 
for the year ended december   our consolidated revenues totaled million  representing a decline of approximately from the prior year 
in response to the declining revenues  we have taken certain actions to reduce our costs including headcount reductions  wage and hiring freezes  and a reduction in capital expenditures and general operating expenses 
based on our anticipated level of future revenues  the cost reduction initiatives implemented to date  along with our existing cash and cash equivalents  we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our cash needs through december  the current challenging economic climate may lead to further reductions in revenues 
if revenues continue to decline  operating losses may continue  and we will be required to take additional actions to further reduce costs  capital spending and restructure operations 
this would also reduce our cash reserves and potentially require us to borrow under the loan and security agreement with td bank 
however  there is no guarantee that our cost reduction actions will generate the cost savings necessary to offset declining revenues and operating profits 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing cost reductions initiatives and or if revenues continue to decline  we might fail the financial covenant contained in the loan and security agreement and therefore be prohibited from borrowings under the loan and security agreement 
these and other factors would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to generate profits in the future

our consolidated days sales outstanding dso  measured on a rolling day basis was days at december   compared to days at december  historically  our accounts receivable balances and our dso are at their lowest point in december as many of our customers utilize the remainder of their operating budgets before their year end budget close out 
as a result  our dso historically declines at year end compared to other months during the year 
in addition  our average dso for was days compared to days in we believe our increased collection efforts in  along with our continued focus on electronic customer billing  are the primary drivers of our improvement in our dso relative to our historic experience

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  fingerstick test kits  and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and the ability to collect must be reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to us for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management regularly assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts receivable could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows from the business group to the carrying value of the long lived assets  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets based on discounted cash flow models 
as discussed in the results of operations  due to the decline in revenues during and  principally due to the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the life insurance industry in which we serve  we performed an impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
based on the analysis  we concluded that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our intangible assets primarily customer relationships  exceeded their carrying values 
as a result  no impairment was recorded on our intangible assets during and in  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators 
accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our long lived assets in the third quarter of and determined that the carrying values of certain long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows under the relief from royalty method and indicated that an impairment of certain of our intangible assets existed 
accordingly  during the third quarter of we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of the ced intangible assets eg  customer relationships and trade names and  consistent with our accounting treatment of the ced as a discontinued operation  this charge is recorded in income loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe that we will realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million federal tax benefit due to the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses that were carried back to under the homeownership and business assistance act of  signed into law in the fourth quarter of share based compensation authoritative accounting literature addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this literature establishes accounting principles which require companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options or non vested stock granted to employees 
compensation cost for stock options and non vested stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
the accounting principles also require that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values of options are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
recently issued accounting standards fair value measurements in september  new authoritative accounting literature established a single definition of fair value  set out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement 
this accounting principle was effective january   except for certain provisions which became effective january  the impact of the adoption of this accounting principle was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in december  new authoritative accounting literature significantly changed the way companies account for business combinations and generally will require more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair value 
under this accounting principle  legal fees and other transaction related costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
this new accounting principle also requires  among other things  acquirers to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition 
this new accounting principle applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of this accounting principle did not impact us during as we made no acquisitions during this period 
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary in december  new authoritative accounting literature established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this new accounting principle requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of operations the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
in addition  this accounting principle established a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this new accounting principle is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  in january  additional literature was issued to clarify certain implementation issues 
the adoption of this accounting principle and  subsequent clarification  did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
share based payment transactions in computing earnings per share in june  new authoritative accounting literature addressed whether awards granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two class method 
unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share 
this accounting principle was effective beginning january   and did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events in may  and as amended in february  new authoritative accounting literature established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this accounting principle was effective for us as of june   and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards codification in june  new authoritative accounting literature established the accounting standards codification the codification as the exclusive source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap recognized by the financial accounting standards board fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
the codification was effective for our third fiscal quarter  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
multiple element arrangements in september  new authoritative accounting literature became effective requiring that revenue be allocated to each unit of accounting in many multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the literature also changed the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
this accounting principle is effective for us as of june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting principle to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
