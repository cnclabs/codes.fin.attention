item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our actual production and sales for any period are less than the corresponding volume of derivative contracts for that period including reductions in production due to operational delays  or if we are unable to perform our activities as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations 
table of contents without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
in addition  our oil and gas financial derivative activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including any circumstance in which a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement  the arrangement is imperfect or our derivative policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned 
under the terms of our senior credit facility with keybank national association  the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we will be allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited  and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volume 
if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties  potentially triggering earlier than anticipated repayments of any outstanding debt obligations and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities 
there is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  which would reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties 
if capitalized costs exceed future cash flows  we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value 
any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities  but will reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
additional write downs could occur if oil and gas prices decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results 
because our properties currently serve  and will likely continue to serve  as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities  a write down in the carrying values of our properties could require us to repay debt earlier than we would otherwise be required 
it is likely that the cumulative effect of a write down could also negatively impact the value of our securities  including our common stock 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
we review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties 

table of contents drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
please read item a 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below for a discussion of the uncertainties involved in these processes 
our costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment malfunctions  failures or accidents  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools  loss of drilling fluid circulation  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas and fluids  fires and natural disasters  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  adverse weather conditions  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
if any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field  we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field  or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field  either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

table of contents our proved reserves and related pv as of december  have been reported under new sec rules that went into effect on january  the estimates provided in accordance with the new sec rules may change materially as a result of interpretive guidance that may be released by the sec 
we have included in this report certain estimates of our proved reserves and related pv at december  as prepared consistent with our independent reserve engineers interpretations of the new sec rules relating to disclosures of estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
these new rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december  these newly adopted rules will require sec reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on month unweighted first day of the month average pricing 
the sec has not reviewed our reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves and related pv at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
we may be limited in our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves under the new sec rules 
another impact of the new sec reserve rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
this new rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves 
to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

table of contents the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation 
there is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable  particularly in light of the current economic environment 
the use of seismic data and other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the same area  will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercially viable quantities 
moreover  the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects 
we cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we own an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  the operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  the approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of suitable technology 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future acquisitions may yield revenue or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in acquiring producing properties  we will assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact  and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems 
table of contents are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for  and development  production and acquisition of  oil and natural gas reserves 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings  cash generated by operations and public stock offerings 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures with the sale of equity  asset sales  cash flow from operations and current and new financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
we may need to seek additional financing in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
also  our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  materially change our business  approve and distribute dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or acquire additional subsidiaries  incur indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  incur liens  and enter into agreements regarding swap and other derivative transactions 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget 
we may  from time to time  encounter difficulty in obtaining  or an increase in the cost of securing  drilling rigs  equipment and supplies 
in addition  larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms 
if we are unable to acquire access to such resources  or can obtain access only at higher prices  our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on pipelines owned by others to transport and sell our natural gas production 
disruption of  capacity constraints in  or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas 
in many instances  we transport our natural gas to market by utilizing pipelines owned by others 
if pipelines do not exist near our producing wells  if pipeline capacity is limited or if pipeline capacity is unexpectedly curtailed or disrupted  we may have to reduce sales of our production of gas because we do not have facilities to store excess inventory 
if this occurs  our revenues will be reduced  and our unit costs will also increase 
in addition  if pipeline gas quality requirements change for a pipeline  we might be required to install 
table of contents additional processing equipment  which could increase our costs 
if this should occur  the pipeline could curtail our gas flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance 
new technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete 
the oil and gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology  including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies 
as competitors use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  competitors may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
one or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us 
if we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards  our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations  and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we face 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  then that accident or other event could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
our operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons does not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
additionally  we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management 

table of contents we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
the exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
such regulation includes requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations 
other activities subject to regulation are the location and spacing of wells  the unitization and pooling of properties  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used or other wastes generated in connection with our drilling operations  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  and the valuation and payment of royalties 
under these laws  we could be subject to claims for personal injury or property damages  including natural resource damages  which may result from the impacts of our operations 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs of compliance 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our drilling and mid stream operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process  which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations 
for example  we are often required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of natural gas or oil may have on the environment 
further  the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits we need may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably 
our operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or injunctive relief 
under existing environmental laws and regulations  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations  or our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 

table of contents changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance  and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional natural gas wells in shale formations 
this process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of two companion bills  which are currently pending in the house energy and commerce committee and the senate committee on environment and public works committee have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
the proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  this legislation  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens 
the adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls that we produce 
a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives have been introduced in the united states that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the senate may act on climate change legislation  how any bill passed by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  or how federal legislation may be reconciled with state and regional requirements  any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls that we produce 
in  the us supreme court held in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa that greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on december   the us environmental protection agency  or epa  officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in late september  the epa also proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in 
table of contents although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect demand for our products and services  which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress and related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the us congress is currently considering legislation to increase the regulatory oversight of the over the counter derivatives markets in order to promote more transparency in those markets  and impose restrictions on certain derivatives transactions  which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
acesa contains provisions that would prohibit private energy commodity derivative and hedging transactions 
acesa would expand the power of the commodity futures trading commission cftc to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities  including oil and natural gas  and to mandate clearance of such derivative contracts through registered derivative clearing organizations 
under acesa  the cftc s expanded authority over energy derivatives would terminate upon the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform 
the chairman of the cftc has announced that the cftc intends to conduct hearings to determine whether to set limits on trading and positions in commodities with finite supply  particularly energy commodities  such as crude oil  natural gas and other energy products 
the cftc also is evaluating whether position limits should be applied consistently across all markets and participants 
in addition  the treasury department recently has indicated that it intends to propose legislation to subject all otc derivative dealers and all other major otc derivative market participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including by imposing conservative capital and margin requirements and strong business conduct standards 
derivative contracts that are not cleared through central clearinghouses and exchanges may be subject to substantially higher capital and margin requirements 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may act on derivatives legislation or how any climate change bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any new laws or regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to hedge and otherwise manage our financial risks related to swings in oil and gas commodity prices  may impose additional restrictions on our trading and commodity positions  and could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of our hedging activity 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 

table of contents the outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims  demands and investigations 
these matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations 
no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us 
an adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims  demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
risks related to our common stock since our initial public offering on july   the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
since our initial public offering on july   the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially 
from july  to march   the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
we expect our common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include changes in oil and natural gas prices  variations in quarterly drilling  recompletions  acquisitions  and operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of comparable companies  additions or departures of key personnel  future issuances of our stock  and the other risks and uncertainties described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report 
we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and our stock price could decline as a result 
volatility or depressed market prices of our common stock could make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock when you want or at attractive prices 
we may issue additional common stock in the future  which would dilute our existing stockholders 
in the future we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  including shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders 
we are authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with such designations  preferences  and rights as may be determined by our board of directors 
as of march   there were  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and there were no shares of our preferred stock issued and outstanding 
we have an effective shelf registration statement from which additional shares of our common stock and other securities can be issued 
in addition  we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel  future acquisitions  future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes 
future issuances of our common stock  or the perception that such issuances could occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

table of contents our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws  and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors and our chairman and other executive officers  who collectively beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us and changes in our management 
these provisions include the following the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval  the ability of our board of directors to make  alter  or repeal our bylaws without further stockholder approval  the requirement for advance notice of director nominations to our board of directors and for proposing other matters to be acted upon at stockholder meetings  the prohibition on stockholders taking action by written consent  requiring that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman  by a majority of our board of directors  by our chief executive officer or by our president  and allowing our directors  and not our stockholders  to fill vacancies on the board of directors  including vacancies resulting from removal or enlargement of the board of directors 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
as of march   our board of directors  including lance t 
shaner  our chairman  and our other executive officers collectively own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
although this is not a majority of our outstanding common stock  these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors  any proposed merger  consolidation  or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions 
the provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under delaware law  and the concentrated ownership of our common stock by our chairman and other executive officers  could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our business 
our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors  including our business  financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and investment opportunities 
in addition  our senior credit facility limits the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders 
accordingly  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment 
this appreciation may not occur 
we are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our

we have approximately  gross  net acres under lease 
during the third quarter of  we sold approximately  net undeveloped acres in indiana and certain non producing wells  which was a part of our new albany shale exploration projects  for approximately million in proceeds 
total proved reserves in the illinois basin increased approximately bcfe  or  to approximately bcfe at december  when compared to year end  which was primarily a result of the increase in oil prices throughout the year 
annual production decreased from capital expenditures in for developmental drilling and facility improvements in the region were approximately million  which funded the drilling of gross net development wells  of which six were awaiting completion as of december  one exploratory well was also drilled in the region that was determined to be a dry hole 
capital expenditures for drilling and facilities development for the lawrence field asp flood project in lawrence county  illinois totaled approximately million 
at december   the illinois basin had a development inventory of proven drilling locations and proven recompletions 
development projects include recompletions  infill drilling and continued refinement of secondary recovery operations 
these activities also include increasing reserves and production through aggressive cost control  upgrading lifting equipment  improving gathering systems and surface facilities and performing re stimulations and re fracturing operations 
lawrence field asp flood project we are implementing an alkali surfactant polymer asp flood project in the cypress and bridgeport sandstone reservoirs of our lawrence field acreage 
the lawrence field asp flood project is one of our largest 
table of contents projects 
the lawrence field asp flood project is considered an enhanced oil recovery eor project  which refers to recovery of oil that is not producible by primary or secondary recovery methods 
the lawrence field in lawrence county  illinois  is believed to have produced more than million barrels of oil from separate horizons since its discovery in we currently own and operate square miles approximately  net acres of the lawrence field  and our properties account for approximately of the current total gross production from the field 
the cypress mississippian and the bridgeport pennsylvanian sandstones are the major producing horizons in the field 
to date  approximately of the estimated one billion barrels of original oil in place has been produced 
in the s  s and s  a number of eor projects using surfactant polymer floods were implemented in several fields in the illinois basin by marathon oil corp 
marathon  texaco and exxon in an attempt to recover a portion of the large percentage of the original oil in place that was being bypassed by the secondary recovery waterflood 
these test projects reportedly were able to recover incremental oil reserves of to of the original oil in place 
in  marathon began a surfactant polymer flood project in the lawrence field on the robins lease  a acre lease in the lawrence field within one mile of the site of one of our pilot test locations 
this project was initiated at a time when the price per barrel of oil was below and the technology of combining alkali and surfactant with polymer  which significantly reduces costs of recovery compared with the previous surfactant polymer floods  had not yet been fully developed 
despite the high costs of the surfactant polymer flooding employed by marathon and the low oil prices  the project produced an estimated  incremental barrels  or an estimated the of original oil in place 
while we believe the results of this project are pertinent  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project  which uses technology that was not developed at the time of the robins lease flood  will achieve similar results 
asp technology  which uses mechanisms to mobilize bypassed residual oil similar to these previous surfactant polymer floods but at significantly lower costs  has been applied by other companies in several fields around the world resulting in significant incremental recoveries of the original oil in place 
chemicals used in the lawrence field asp flood project are an alkali naoh or naco  a surfactant and a polymer 
the alkali to and surfactant to combination washes residual oil from the reservoir mainly by reducing interfacial tension between the oil and the water 
the polymer to parts per million is added to improve sweep displacement efficiency 
asp technology achieves its incremental recovery by reducing capillary forces that trap oil  improving aerial and vertical sweep efficiency and reducing mobility ratio 
our lawrence field asp flood project will use asp technology to flood our lawrence field wells 
the goal of our lawrence field asp flood project is to duplicate the oil recovery performance of the surfactant polymer floods conducted in the field in the s  but at a significantly lower cost 
we expect this cost reduction to be accomplished by utilizing newer technologies to optimize the synergistic performance of the three chemicals used  and by using alkali in the formula  which would allow us to use a significantly lower concentration of the more costly surfactant 
in  penntex illinois  then known as plains illinois  inc  and the us department of energy conducted a study on the potential of an asp project in the lawrence field  with consulting services provided by an independent engineering firm specializing in the design and implementation of chemical oil recovery systems 
based on the modeling of the reservoir characteristics and laboratory tests with cores taken in the lawrence field  the evaluation found oil recovery in the field could be increased significantly by installing an asp flood 
similar eor techniques have been successfully demonstrated in fields around the world to recover an additional to of the original oil in place 
however  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project will achieve similar results 
in  we engaged a third party consultant to review and update the evaluation on the application of the asp process to the lawrence field 
this evaluation  based on laboratory results  recommended two pilot areas to 
table of contents evaluate the asp process in the bridgeport and cypress sandstones 
the asp pilot test locations are positioned in areas that we believe are representative of variabilities that can be expected in these reservoirs 
based on our consultant s recommendations  we drilled and cored the central producing well in each of the two proposed pilot test areas 
these cores were sent to our consultant for asp chemical system design 
during  our consultant completed its linear and radial core flood analysis on the cypress and bridgeport sandstones  which in the laboratory resulted in an oil recovery rate as high as of the estimated original oil in place in the cypress sandstone  and of the original oil in place in the bridgeport sandstone 
these results were in line with our initial projections 
during and  we completed two four acre pilot tests  one each in the bridgeport and cypress sandstones 
both of the pilots demonstrated a response to the chemical injection  as indicated by an increase in both oil production and the oil cut ratio 
each pilot area had individual wells whose oil cut exceeded after the initial response  whereas the oil cuts for both pilots at the time asp injection was initiated were less than 
our lawrence field asp project is not a proved project nor are any of the potential reserves associated with this project considered proved at this time 
we have identified  thus far  potential separate flood units bridgeport cypress 
we are currently in the process of designing the first operationally sized asp unit in the bridgeport sandstone which will cover approximately acres with chemical injection commencing during it is anticipated that the initial response time from the chemical injection date will be approximately four to eight months and the time to peak response will be approximately months 
appalachian basin as of december   we own an interest in approximately producing natural gas wells in the appalachian basin  located predominantly in pennsylvania 
in addition to our producing wells in the basin  we own proved undeveloped drilling locations with total reserves of bcfe  and three locations with proved developed non producing reserves totaling mmcf 
at december   we had approximately  gross  net acres in the appalachian basin under lease  of which  gross  net acres were undeveloped 
reserves at december  increased bcfe  or  from due primarily to additional drilling activities  including marcellus shale exploration  which were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices 
annual production increased over marcellus shale the marcellus shale is a black  organic rich shale formation located at depths between  and  feet and ranges in thickness from to feet on our acreage in southwestern and central pennsylvania 
as of december   we had interests in approximately  gross  net marcellus shale prospective acres in these areas of pennsylvania and we continue to expand our position 
the net acreage amount excludes approximately  acres which can be earned by williams pursuant to the participation and exploration agreement described below 
on june   we entered into a participation and exploration agreement the pea with williams production company  llc and williams production appalachia  llc collectively  williams that was effective as of may  under the terms and conditions of the pea  williams may acquire  through a drill to earn structure  of our working interest in certain oil and gas leases covering approximately  net acres in centre  clearfield and westmoreland counties  pennsylvania the project area 
the pea effectively provides that  for williams to earn its interest in the project area  williams will bear of all costs and expenses incurred in the drilling and completion of all wells jointly drilled in the project area until such time as williams has invested approximately million approximately million on behalf of us 
table of contents and million for williams share of the wells 
once williams has completed its carry obligation and acquired of our working interest in the leases within the project area  the parties will share all costs of the joint venture operations with an area of mutual interest including the project area in accordance with their participating interests  which are expected to be on a basis 
we believe this agreement will allow us to accelerate our activities in the marcellus shale while conserving capital at the same time 
during  we met our goal of drilling and completing at least one horizontal well in each of our main project areas 
capital expenditures in for drilling and facility development totaled million  net of approximately million that was reimbursed to us upon the execution of the participation and exploration agreement with williams  which funded the drilling of seven gross net exploratory wells  of which six gross net were completed and producing and one gross net were awaiting completion and expected to be productive 
our plans for have allocated approximately million in capital expenditures to our marcellus shale project areas 
proved reserves in december  the sec released its finalized rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule requires disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area  using the arithmetic month average beginning of the month price for the year  as opposed to using year end prices as was practiced previously 
the rule also allows for the use of reliable technologies to estimate proved oil and gas reserves  contingent on demonstrated reliability in conclusions about reserve volumes 
under the new rules  companies are required to report on the independence and qualifications of its reserve preparer or auditor  and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit 
the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves based on the new sec rules as defined in rule a of regulation s x and item of regulation s k category net reserves oil barrels ngl barrels gas mcf proved developed proved undeveloped total proved all of our reserves are located within the continental united states 
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and remain subject to revisions based on production history  results of additional exploration and development  prices of oil and natural gas and other factors 
please read item a risk factors our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
you should also read the notes following the table below and our consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended december  in conjunction with the following reserve estimates

estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic impact that may result from our financial derivative activities 
these calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry 
the reserve information shown is estimated 
the certainty of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data  the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the estimates of reserves  future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions  and are inherently imprecise 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates

represents the present value  discounted at per annum pv  of estimated future cash flows before income tax of our estimated proved reserves 
the estimated future cash flows set forth above were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on prevailing economic conditions 
the estimated future production is priced based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  using per bbl and per mmbtu and adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies

recent sec rule making activity in december  the sec announced that it had approved revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements 
the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 

table of contents disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserve guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction 
we adopted the rules effective december   as required by the sec 
effect of adoption 
application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices at december  for both oil and gas than would have resulted under the previous rules 
use of new month average pricing rules at december  resulted in proved reserves of approximately bcfe 
use of the old year end prices rules would have resulted in proved reserves of approximately bcfe at december  therefore  the total impact of the new price methodology rules resulted in negative reserves revisions of bcfe 
proved undeveloped reserves puds as of december   our proved undeveloped reserves totaled mmboe of crude oil  mmboe of ngls and bcf of natural gas  for a total of bcfe 
approximately of our puds at year end were associated with the appalachian basin 
an additional of puds at year end were associated with the illinois basin 
all of these projects will have puds convert from undeveloped to developed as these projects begin production and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded 
changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to conversion of approximately bcfe attributable to puds into proved developed reserves  positive revisions of approximately bcfe in puds due to changes in commodity prices  and bcfe in puds due to extensions and discoveries  which are primarily related to the extension of proved acreage in areas that are prospective for the marcellus shale through our drilling activities 
costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately million in estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in all pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of initial production from these puds is expected to begin between to we do not have puds associated with reserves that have been booked for longer than five years

table of contents the estimates of reserves in the table above conform to the guidelines of the sec 
estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic impact that may result from our financial derivative activities 
these calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry 
the estimated present value of proved reserves does not give effect to indirect expenses such as debt service and future income tax expense  asset retirement obligations  or to depletion  depreciation and amortization 
the reserve information shown is estimated 
the certainty of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data  the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
the estimates of reserves  future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions  and are inherently imprecise 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates 
also  the use of a discount factor for reporting purposes may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor  given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject 
because each of the predecessor companies was a flow through entity for state and federal tax purposes  our historical standardized measure does not deduct state or federal taxes 
this differs from our pro forma standardized measure  which deducts state and federal taxes 
non gaap financial measures we include in this report our calculations of ebitdax and pv  which are non gaap financial measures 
below  we provide reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitdax ebitdax means  for any period  the sum of net income for such period plus the following expenses  charges or income to the extent deducted from or added to net income in such period interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  unrealized losses from financial derivatives  exploration expenses and other similar non cash charges  minus all non cash income  including but not limited to  income from unrealized financial derivatives  added to net income 
ebitdax  as defined above  is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements  such as our commercial bank lenders  to analyze such things as our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financial or capital structure  the financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
ebitdax is not a calculation based on gaap financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss in measuring our performance  nor used as an exclusive measure of cash flow  because it does not consider the impact of working capital growth  capital expenditures  debt principal reductions  and other sources and uses of cash  which are disclosed in our statements of cash flows 
we have reported ebitdax because it is a financial measure used by our existing commercial lenders  and we believe this measure is commonly reported and widely used by investors as an indicator of a company s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt 
you should carefully consider the specific items included in our computations of ebitdax 
while we have disclosed our ebitdax to permit a more complete comparative analysis of our operating performance and debt servicing ability relative to other companies  you are 
table of contents cautioned that ebitdax as reported by us may not be comparable in all instances to ebitdax as reported by other companies 
ebitdax amounts may not be fully available for management s discretionary use  due to requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  debt service and other commitments 
we believe ebitdax assists our lenders and investors in comparing a company s performance on a consistent basis without regard to certain expenses  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods 
because we may borrow money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
additionally  we are required to pay federal and state taxes  which are necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe it is important to consider both net income determined under gaap and ebitdax to evaluate our performance 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our net income to our ebitdax for each of the periods presented in thousands year ended december  net income loss add back depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion add back non cash compensation expense add back interest expense add back exploration impairment expense less interest income add back gain loss on disposal of assets add back unrealized gain loss on financial derivatives add back noncontrolling interest share of net gain loss less income tax benefit ebitdax from continuing operations add ebitdax from discontinued operations ebitdax includes realized settlements on interest rate swap 

table of contents pv the following table shows the reconciliation of pv to our pro forma standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
pv represents our estimate of the present value  discounted at per annum  of estimated future cash flows before income tax of our estimated proved reserves 
our estimated future cash flows as of december   and were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on the prevailing economic conditions 
the estimated future production is priced at december  and  without escalation  using and per bbl of oil  respectively  and and per mmbtu of natural gas  respectively  as adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
the estimated future production for the year ended december   was priced based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  without escalation  using per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of natural gas  as adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
management believes that pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid  we believe the use of a pre tax measure is valuable for evaluating our company 
pv should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under gaap 
reconciliation of pv to pro forma standardized measure millions a pro forma standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at b add present value of future asset retirement obligations discounted at pv a does not include values of our southwest region properties which are classified as assets held for sale on our balance sheet 
b at december   the tax basis of our assets exceeded the future cash flows of our oil and gas properties  which indicates that no future income taxes will be paid 
impairment testing was performed on our oil and gas properties at year end based on escalating future oil and natural gas prices 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at december  was based on the year end sec commodity prices  which are held constant for the life of the properties 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates  and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors appearing elsewhere in this report 
all financial and operating data presented are the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
overview of our business we are an independent oil and gas company operating in the appalachian basin and the illinois basin 
in the appalachian basin  we are focused on our marcellus shale drilling projects 
in the illinois basin  in addition to our developmental conventional oil drilling  we are focused on the implementation of enhanced oil recovery on our properties 
we pursue a balanced growth strategy of exploiting our sizable inventory of lower risk developmental drilling locations  pursuing our higher potential exploration drilling prospects  and actively seeking to acquire complementary oil and natural gas properties 
we are headquartered in state college  pennsylvania  and have a regional office in bridgeport  illinois 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  refinery or pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
on march   we completed the sale of certain oil and gas leases  wells and related assets predominantly located in the permian basin in the states of texas and new mexico 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have reclassified these assets and associated liabilities as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and have reported the results of operations under discontinued operations on our consolidated and combined statements of operations 
total revenues for these properties for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
total assets held for sale for the years ended december  and were and million  respectively 
source of our revenues we generate our revenue primarily from the sale of crude oil to refining companies and natural gas to local distribution and pipeline companies 
our operating revenue before the effects of financial derivatives from these operations  and their relative percentages of our total revenue  consisted of the following in thousands of total of total of total revenue from oil sales revenue from natural gas sales revenue from ngl sales other total 
table of contents we have identified the impact of generally volatile commodity prices in the last several years as an important trend that we expect to affect our business in the future 
if commodity prices increase  we would expect not only an increase in revenue  but also the competitive environment for quality drilling prospects  qualified geological and technical personnel and oil field services  including rig availability 
increasing competition in these areas would likely result in higher costs in these areas  and could result in unavailability of drilling rigs  thus affecting the profitability of our future operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with larger competitors in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
in the event of a declining commodity price environment  our revenues would decrease and we would anticipate that the cost of materials and services would decrease as well  although at a slower rate 
decreasing oil or natural gas prices may also make some of our prospects uneconomical to drill 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses consist of the following production and lease operating expenses 
day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include workovers  repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance  and various production taxes that are paid based upon rates set by federal  state  and local taxing authorities 
exploration expense 
geological and geophysical costs  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells  also known as dry holes 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes non cash stock based compensation expense as part of employee compensation 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our senior credit facility 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  at some point  we believe we will use all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we believe we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 

table of contents how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include ebitdax  lease operating expenses per mcf equivalent mcfe  growth in our proved reserve base  and general and administrative expenses per mcfe 
the following table presents these metrics for continuing operations for each of the three years ended december   and performance measurements years ended december  ebitdax in thousands production cost per mcfe total proved reserves bcfe g a per mcfe ebitdax ebitdax means  for any period  the sum of net income for such period plus the following expenses  charges or income to the extent deducted from or added to net income in such period interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  unrealized losses from financial derivatives  exploration expenses and other similar non cash charges  minus all non cash income  including but not limited to  income from unrealized financial derivatives  added to net income 
ebitdax  as defined above  is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements  such as our commercial bank lenders  to analyze such things as our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financial or capital structure  the financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
production cost per mcfe production costs are comprised of those expenses which are directly attributable to our producing oil and gas leases  including state and county production taxes  production related insurance  the cost of materials  maintenance  electricity  chemicals  fuel and the wages of our field personnel 
our production costs per boe are higher than those of many of our peers primarily because of the nature of our oil properties  many of which are mature waterflood properties 
our production cost per mcfe produced in was as compared to in and in as we continue to develop our non proved properties  such as the marcellus shale  we believe this metric will continue to decrease on a per unit basis 
growth in our proved reserve base we measure our ability to grow our proved reserves over the amount of our total annual production 
as we produce oil and gas attributable to our proved reserves  our proved reserves decrease each year by that amount of production 
we attempt to replace these produced proved reserves each year through the addition of new proved reserves through our drilling and other property improvement projects and through acquisitions 
our proved reserves have fluctuated since  from bcfe at year end to bcfe at year end to bcfe 
table of contents at year end our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately based on total production for the year of bcfe  purchases of reserves of bcfe  and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately based on total production for the year of bcfe  purchases of reserves of bcfe  and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately based on total production for the year of bcfe  and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our proved reserve base increased in when compared to predominately due to the increase in oil prices used for the reserves determination and our successful drilling programs in the marcellus shale 
these gains were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices used for the reserves determination 
the change in oil prices primarily impacted our illinois basin  which accounts for of our total production  and of our oil production 
additionally  our proved reserve base in the appalachian basin increased by approximately  despite a decrease in natural gas prices 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of oil and gas revenue our general and administrative expenses include fees for well operating services  marketing  non field level employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our general and administrative expenses in relation to our revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
in our general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to from in and from in results of continuing operations general overview operating revenue decreased for over this decrease is primarily due to lower average sales prices per mcfe throughout the year and a decrease in oil production  partially offset by increased gas production 
for  total production increased to  mmcfe from  mmcfe in due to the continued success of our drilling programs  primarily in the marcellus shale 
operating expenses decreased million in  or  as compared to operating expenses are primarily composed of production expenses  general and administrative expenses  gain loss on disposal of assets  exploration expenses  impairment of oil and gas properties and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expenses dd a 
these decreases were primarily due to non cash impairment expenses of million incurred during compared to non cash impairment expenses of million incurred during the impairment expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the decline in oil and gas prices during the year  at which time we determined that the carrying value of some of our oil and gas properties was not recoverable and exceeded their fair value 
also contributing to the decrease were lower dd a expenses  which decreased approximately million when compared to  primarily due to our increased proved reserves which decelerated our units of production calculation 
other contributing factors included a decrease in losses on the disposal of assets of approximately million  which was impacted by the sale of our new albany shale assets in  as well as a decrease in our lease operating expenses of approximately million  which was attributable to lower activity levels in our illinois basin operations and increased cost management efforts

our production for averaged approximately  mcfe per day of which was attributable to the illinois basin and to the appalachian basin 
other operating revenue for of approximately  increased  or  from we generate other operating revenue from various activities such as revenue from the transportation of natural gas and well tending 
production and lease operating expense decreased approximately million  or  in from the decrease in expense can be partially attributed to lower activity levels in our illinois basin operations throughout we also implemented several cost reduction measures in an effort to mitigate discretionary spending and to lower overall operating expenses 
general and administrative expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from the year over year increase is primarily attributable to legal expenses  which have increased due to accruals associated with the pending actions related to our marcellus shale leasing activities as well as the accruals associated with a settlement agreement and release entered into in december of to settle a class action lawsuit see note  litigation  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

table of contents impairment expense decreased to million in from million in we evaluate impairment of our properties when events occur that indicate that the carrying value of these properties may not be recoverable 
during  we determined that  due to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices  the carrying value of some of our properties was not recoverable and exceeded their fair value 
during  the recoverability of our properties improved as oil prices increased and we continued to drill successful horizontal wells in areas where the marcellus shale is prospective 
we did  however  identify certain geographic regions that are outside the scope of our current plans  which has increased the probability of future lease expirations 
the capitalized costs associated with these properties are periodically evaluated as to their recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in our business strategy 
as economic and strategic conditions change and we continue to develop unproved properties  our estimates of impairment will likely change and we may increase or decrease expense 
loss on disposal of assets for was approximately million as compared to million for we  from time to time  sell or otherwise dispose of certain fixed assets and wells that are no longer effectively used by us  and a gain or loss may be recognized when such an asset is sold 
the loss incurred in is primarily due to the sale of our new albany shale acreage holdings in areas of the illinois basin 
exploration expense of oil and gas properties for decreased approximately million from million in during  we incurred higher expenses due to geological modeling in our lawrence field asp project and geophysical evaluation and modeling associated with our marcellus shale activities during the year 
our expense associated with geophysical evaluation and modeling associated with our marcellus shale activities decreased in  in part  due to our joint venture with williams as we share the cost of these activities on an equal basis 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expense of approximately million for decreased approximately million  or  from this decrease can be primarily explained by the upward revision in the estimated lives of our proved reserves 
we calculate our depletion on a units of production basis  which decelerated in relation to our higher proved reserves base 
interest expense  net of interest income  for was approximately  as compared to  for the slight increase in interest expense  net of interest income  was primarily due to the decrease in the amount of cash on hand  for which we receive interest income  as well as depressed interest rates when compared to the prior year 
gain loss on derivatives  net for was a loss of approximately million as compared to a gain of million for this change is attributed to the volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the marketplace along with changes in our portfolio of outstanding collars and swap derivatives 
losses from derivative activities generally reflect higher oil and gas prices in the marketplace than were in effect at the time we entered into a derivative contract  while gains would suggest the opposite 
our derivative program is designed to provide us with greater reliability of future cash flows at expected levels of oil and gas production volumes given the highly volatile oil and gas commodities market 
other expense increased by  to approximately  in our other expense is characterized by the recognition of gains or losses on the sale of scrap inventory and physical yard inventory adjustments and fluctuates from period to period 
net loss attributable to rex energy for was approximately million  as compared to a net loss of approximately million for as a result of the factors discussed above

the average realized price for oil in increased or per barrel  whereas the average realized price for natural gas increased  or per mcf  from our derivative activities effectively decreased net realized prices by per mcfe in and per mcfe in production volume increased from primarily due to continued success with our oil and gas well drilling activities  particularly in the appalachian basin where production increased approximately  or mmcfe 
our production for averaged approximately  mcfe per day of which was attributable to the illinois basin and to the appalachian basin 
other operating revenue for of approximately  increased  or  from we generate other operating revenue from various activities such as revenue from the transportation of natural gas and well tending 
production and lease operating expense increased approximately million  or  in from the increase in expense can be partially attributed to a higher cost of conducting business in the oil and natural gas industry  as the cost of durable goods has risen throughout our areas of operation for items such as steel  chemicals and electricity 
also contributing to the increase in expense is the greater number of wells in service in as compared to general and administrative expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from the increase in g a expense was primarily due to increased costs associated with consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and additional staffing needs in our corporate headquarters and field offices in relation to our growth 
non cash compensation expenses increased from by approximately million to million in  of which approximately million is due to the voluntary cancellation of  stock option awards by members of our board of directors 
impairment expense increased to million in from in we evaluate impairment of our properties when events occur that indicate that the carrying value of these properties may not be recoverable 
at 
table of contents december   we determined that the carrying value of some of our oil and gas properties was not recoverable and exceeded fair value 
the decrease in our assets fair value was the result of the decrease in oil and natural gas prices at year end as compared to contributing to the increase in impairment expense was the impairment of goodwill of approximately million 
loss on disposal of assets for was approximately million as compared to a gain of  for we  from time to time  sell or otherwise dispose of certain fixed assets and wells that are no longer effectively used by us  and a gain or loss may be recognized when such an asset is sold 
the loss incurred in is primarily due to the sale of our new albany shale acreage holdings in areas of the illinois basin 
exploration expense of oil and gas properties for increased approximately million from million in this increase is primarily due to geological modeling in our lawrence field asp project and geophysical evaluation and modeling associated with our marcellus shale activities during the year 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from this increase can be primarily explained by the downward revision in the estimated lives of our proved reserves 
we calculate our depletion on a units of production basis  which accelerated in relation to our lower proved reserves base 
interest expense  net of interest income  for was approximately  as compared to million for the decrease of million is primarily due to the decrease in the average balance on our long term debt  lines of credit and other loans and notes payable 
we used the proceeds of our public offering in the second quarter of to pay off our entire line of credit balance in may as a result  we did not have any amounts drawn on our line of credit until october gain loss on derivatives  net for was approximately million as compared to a loss of million for this change is attributed to the volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the marketplace along with changes in our portfolio of outstanding collars and swap derivatives 
unrealized losses from derivative activities generally reflect higher oil and gas prices in the marketplace than were in effect at the time we entered into a derivative contract  while unrealized gains would suggest the opposite 
our derivative program is designed to provide us with greater reliability of future cash flows at expected levels of oil and gas production volumes given the highly volatile oil and gas commodities market 
other expense increased by  to approximately  in the change is primarily due to the recognition of gains and losses on the sale of scrap inventory 
net loss attributable to rex energy for was approximately million  as compared to a net loss of approximately million for as a result of the factors discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we grant security interests in our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our senior credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on our senior credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our acquisitions  development or exploration programs  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the senior credit facilities 
under extreme 
table of contents circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes 
prices for oil and gas are driven by  among other things  seasonal influences of weather  national and international economic and political environments and  increasingly  from heightened demand for hydrocarbons from emerging nations 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices  and significant declines in prices could decrease our exploration and development expenditures 
cash flows from operations have been primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas interests 
financial condition and cash flows for the years ended december   and the following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the periods noted for the years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
in  cash flows decreased primarily due to decreases in the average price received for our oil and natural gas production 
we partially offset these declines in prices by focusing on cost control measures by decreasing discretionary activities in our illinois basin and implementing cost reduction plans which helped to lower our overall production and lease operating expenses 
additionally  our realized gains on derivatives during helped to offset the lower commodity prices by approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
during  we took a conservative approach to our investing activities  whereby we decreased our normal development activities and put more focus on our more strategic projects  such as marcellus shale exploration 
also contributing to the decreased investing activity was the participation and exploration agreement entered into with williams 
throughout the course of the second half of  williams has been responsible for of the drilling and completion costs of our marcellus shale wells within our area of joint operations 
in addition  upon the signing of the participation and exploration agreement  williams reimbursed us for costs previously incurred in the amount of million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
during  we received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately million 
our cash provided by financing activities in include net proceeds from long term borrowings of approximately million 
capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
during  million of capital was expended on drilling projects  facilities and related equipment and acquisitions to purchase additional interests in producing properties and unproved acreage 
the capital program was funded by net cash flows from operations  proceeds from borrowings and from the proceeds of disposed assets 
the capital budget of million is expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operations  proceeds from borrowings and from a public offering of common stock that closed in january for further information see note  subsequent events  to our 
table of contents consolidated and combined financial statements 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flows and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  to extend maturities or to repay debt 
effects of inflation and changes in price our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases or decreases  there could be a corresponding increase or decrease in our operating costs  as well as an increase or decrease in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
critical accounting policies and recently adopted accounting pronouncements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future cash flows  asset retirement obligations  impairment when applicable of undeveloped properties  the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable  fair values of financial derivative instruments  contingencies and the results of current and future litigation 
oil and natural gas estimates  which are the basis for units of production depletion  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the certainty of any reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
subsequent drilling results  testing and production may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
these prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially affected by changes in future economic conditions such as the market prices received for sales of oil and natural gas  interest rates  and our ability to generate future income 
future changes in these assumptions may materially affect these significant estimates in the near term 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
for the year ended december   netherland sewell and associates  inc nsai prepared a consolidated reserve and economic evaluation of our proved oil and gas reserves 
for the year ended december   schlumberger consulting and data services evaluated the proved reserves of our marcellus shale properties while nsai evaluated the proved reserves on all of our other properties 
these engineers were selected for their geographic expertise and their historical experience in engineering certain properties 
the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserves estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
our independent third party engineers do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis 
the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are 
table of contents completed in accordance with our internal control procedures  which include the verification of input data used by nsai  as well as intense management review and approval 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the recent rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements and which we adopted effective december  reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the certainty of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors  including the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
any of the assumptions inherent in these factors could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas and oil eventually recovered 
the independent reserve engineer estimates reserves annually on december this annual estimate results in a new dd a rate  which we use for the preceding fourth quarter after adjusting for fourth quarter production 
derivative instruments we use put and call options collars and fixed rate swap contracts to manage price risks in connection with the sale of oil and natural gas 
we also use interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with our variable rate credit facility 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
we report our derivative instruments at fair value and include them in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any changes in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness are recognized immediately in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
derivative effectiveness is measured annually based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
for derivatives on oil and natural gas production activity  our evaluations are not documented  and as a result  we record changes on the derivative valuations through earnings 
oil and natural gas property  depreciation and depletion we account for natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved developed natural gas and oil property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed periodically on a property by property basis and any impairment in value is recognized 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved natural gas and oil properties 
natural gas and oil exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development well and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and oil  are capitalized 

table of contents depletion  depreciation and amortization are calculated using the units of production method on estimated proved developed producing oil and gas reserves at the lease or well level 
in arriving at rates under the units of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers 
we periodically review our proved reserve estimates and makes changes as needed to depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses to account for new wells drilled  acquisitions  divestitures and other events which may have caused significant changes in our estimated proved developed producing reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are either developed or abandoned 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to costs subject to depletion calculations 
non producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold cost and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves 
undeveloped leasehold cost is transferred to the associated producing properties 
individually significant non producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value 
service properties  equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of to years 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
when evaluating our unproved oil and gas properties  we utilize active market prices for similar acreage to use as a comparison tool against the carrying value of our properties 
if the active market prices for similar acreage do not support our carrying values we then utilize estimates of future value that will be created from the future development of these properties 
if future estimated fair value of these properties is lower than the capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to the estimated future fair value 
at december   we recognized approximately million of impairment on certain oil and gas properties in the appalachian basin 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced that extends the useful or productive life of the property is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 
upon the sale or retirement of a proved natural gas or oil property  or an entire interest in unproved leaseholds  the cost and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization are removed from the property accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
for sales of a partial interest in unproved leaseholds for cash or cash equivalents  sales proceeds are first applied as a reduction of the original cost of the entire interest in the property  and any remaining proceeds are recognized as a gain 
intangible assets at december   our intangible assets consisted of  of sales agreements that are amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
these intangible assets resulted from the reorganization transactions for additional information  see note  basis of presentation and principles of consolidation  of our consolidated and combined financial statements 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded amortization expense of   and  respectively 
amortization expense was recorded only for those periods following the reorganization transactions 

table of contents future abandonment cost future abandonment costs are recognized as obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition and development of the asset 
we recognize the fair value of a liability for a retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for natural gas and oil properties  this is the period in which the natural gas or oil well is acquired or drilled 
the future abandonment cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our natural gas and oil properties at its discounted fair value 
the liability is then accreted each period until the liability is settled or the natural gas or oil well is sold  at which time the liability is reversed 
if the fair value of a recorded asset retirement obligation changes  a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an increase of million in the estimated present value of the asset retirement obligations 
the primary factors underlying the fair value revisions were an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates  the effect of changes in inflation and discount rates used in the calculations  and changes to the estimated useful life assumptions 
deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed several months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
we have recognized an accrued liability of approximately million at december  for the estimated cost of pending litigation matters 
accounting standards not yet adopted in april  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  which amends and clarifies asc to address application issues regarding initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
asc is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  although we did not enter into any significant business combinations during the first months of  we believe asc may have a material impact on our future financial statements depending on the size and nature of any future business combinations that we may enter into 
we adopted asc on january

we adopted asu as of january  adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
we account for our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated and combined financial statements to mitigate some of our commodity price risk we engage periodically in certain other limited derivative activities  including price swaps and costless collars  to establish some price floor protection 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net realized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million  which includes a million gain from the early settlement of oil hedges relating to the calendar year for the twelve month period ended december   the net realized loss on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately gains and losses are reported as gain loss on derivatives  net in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net unrealized loss on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million  as compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately million on oil and natural gas derivatives for the net unrealized gains and losses are reported as gain loss on derivatives  net in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
while the use of derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of oil and natural gas 
we enter into the majority of our derivative transactions with one counterparty and have a netting agreement in place with that counterparty 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but we believe our credit risk is currently minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable commodity price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed again to price risk 
we have additional 
table of contents risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the derivative transaction 
moreover  our derivative arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production  and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our derivatives will vary from time to time 
for a summary of our current oil and natural gas derivative positions at december   refer to note  fair value of financial instruments and derivative instruments  of our consolidated and combined financial statements 
contractual obligations in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and operating leases 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the table below  our balance sheet at december  reflects accrued interest on our bank debt of  which is payable in january the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at december  and their future maturities 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including energy commodity price risk 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices were to decrease for a substantial amount of time or decline significantly  revenues and cash flows would significantly decline  and our ability to borrow to finance our 
table of contents operations could be adversely impacted 
our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
conversely  increases in the market prices for oil and natural gas can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per barrel of oil and the price per mcf of gas from year end would reduce our gross revenues  before the effects of derivatives  for the year ending december  by approximately million 
we have designed our hedging policy to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
our risk management policy provides for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments that we use include swaps and collars 
the volume of derivative instruments that we may use are governed by the risk management policy and can vary from year to year  but under most circumstances will apply to only a portion of our current and anticipated production  and will provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
we are exposed to market risk on our open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of oil and natural gas 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
further  if our counterparties should default  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges

at december   we had commodity derivative contracts in place for the next three years  relating to production through we are also exposed to market risk related to adverse changes in interest rates 
our interest rate risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in short term rates  which are libor and prime rate based  as determined by our lenders  and may result in reductions of earnings or cash flows due to increases in the interest rates we pay on our obligations 
we use the interest rate swap agreement to manage risk associated with interest payments on amounts outstanding from variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility 
under our interest rate swap agreement  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to receive in return  a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount
