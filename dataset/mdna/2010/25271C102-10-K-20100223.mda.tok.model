item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling 
our fleet of offshore drilling rigs consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
overview industry conditions the global economy remained weak in the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of and energy prices continued to be volatile 
given the unpredictable economic environment  the demand for our services and the dayrates we were able to command for new contracts softened 
this volatility and uncertainty could continue until the global economy improves 
absent global economic improvement the decline in drilling activity could be further exacerbated by the influx of new build rigs over the next several years  particularly in regard to jack up units 
we have experienced negative effects of the current market such as customer credit problems  customers attempting to renegotiate or terminate contracts  one customer seeking bankruptcy protection  a further slowing in the pace of new contracting activity  declines in dayrates for new contracts  declines in utilization and the stacking of idle equipment 
nevertheless  during  we added new commitments to our contract backlog 
we entered with a contract backlog approaching billion  which we expect to help mitigate the impact of the current market on us in floaters approximately of the time on our intermediate and high specification floater rigs is committed for additionally  of the time on our floating rigs is committed in international jack ups the industry s jack up market is divided between an international sector and a us sector  with the international sector historically characterized by contracts of longer duration and higher prices  compared to the generally shorter term and lower priced domestic sector 
however  in demand and dayrates softened internationally as existing rigs rolled off contract and met competition from un contracted new build jack ups that came to market 
it is expected that this oversupply of jack up rigs will have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector during and beyond 
gom jack ups in the domestic jack up sector  lower natural gas prices have negatively impacted both demand and dayrates 
in response  to reduce costs  we have cold stacked three of our lower end jack up units  and they are not being actively marketed 
our four remaining higher specification jack ups in the gom are largely working under short term contracts 
absent a sustained improvement in energy prices  weakness in the gom jack up market is likely to continue in  with the possibility of additional rigs being cold stacked by the industry in an effort to help bring equipment supply and demand into equilibrium 
contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  
the october period includes both firm commitments typically represented by signed contracts  as well as previously disclosed letters of intent  or lois  where indicated 
an loi is subject to customary conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement  and as such may not result in a binding contract 
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual 
table of contents periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts 
february  october  february  in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups total contract drilling backlog as of february  for our high specification floaters includes billion attributable to our expected operations offshore brazil for the years to contract drilling backlog as of february  for our intermediate semisubmersibles includes billion attributable to our expected operations offshore brazil for the years to contract drilling backlog as of october  included an aggregate million in contract drilling revenue related to future work for one of our high specification floaters for which a definitive agreement was subsequently reached 
the following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of february  for the years ending december  total in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups total contract drilling backlog as of february  for our high specification floaters includes million  million and million for the years  and  respectively  and million in the aggregate for the years to  attributable to our expected operations offshore brazil 
contract drilling backlog as of february  for our intermediate semisubmersibles includes million  million and million for the years  and  respectively  and million in the aggregate for the years to  attributable to our expected operations offshore brazil 
the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of february  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet  to total available days number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected final commissioning date for the ocean valor 
for the years ending december  rig days committed high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups includes approximately and scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for and  respectively 

table of contents casualty loss in september  the jack up rig ocean tower sustained significant damage during hurricane ike  which impacted the gulf of mexico and the upper texas and louisiana gulf coasts 
the ocean tower lost its derrick  drill floor and drill floor equipment during the hurricane 
during the third quarter of  we wrote off the approximately million net book value of the derrick  drill floor and drill floor equipment for the ocean tower and accrued million in estimated salvage costs for the recovery of equipment from the ocean floor 
the aggregate amount of these items was reflected in casualty loss in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell the ocean tower and transferred the million net book value of the rig to assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
the sale of the ocean tower was completed on october   and we recognized a million gain on the sale which has been presented as gain on disposition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
the agreement prohibited the competitive use of the rig  which is expected to be deployed by the purchaser as an accommodation unit 
general the two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs 
conversely  as utilization rates decrease  dayrates tend to decrease as well  reflecting the excess supply of rigs 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive fees either lump sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs either lump sum or dayrate 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most 
table of contents significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades 
for  we expect depreciation expense to increase approximately million compared to  due to the acquisitions of the ocean courage and ocean valor 
see sources of liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital requirements capital expenditures 
periods of high  sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper  working order 
in addition  during periods of high activity and dayrates  higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses  which causes our costs for goods and services to increase 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year  as well as from quarter to quarter 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
during  five of our rigs will require year surveys  and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately days in the aggregate 
we also expect to spend an additional approximately days during for intermediate surveys  the mobilization of rigs  commissioning and contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects 
we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections  planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects 
see overview contract drilling backlog 
we are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
if a named windstorm in the us gulf of mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  under our current insurance policy that expires on may   we continue to carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico  for which our deductible for physical damage is million per occurrence 
construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and 
table of contents the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
for the years ended december  and  we capitalized interest of million and million  respectively  on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the ocean endeavor and ocean monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs  the ocean shield and ocean scepter  through the date of each project s completion 
the upgrades of the ocean endeavor and ocean monarch were completed in march and december  respectively 
construction of the ocean shield and ocean scepter was completed in may and august  respectively 
we did not capitalize interest on any qualifying assets during interest expense 
we expect interest expense in to increase approximately million compared to as a result of our issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  or senior notes  in october and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  or senior notes  in may see sources of liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital requirements senior notes and sources of liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital requirements senior notes

critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as the cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a new build or major rig upgrade 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  and salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant as part of our analysis 
as of december   we had cold stacked our three mat supported jack up rigs and were in the process of cold stacking an intermediate semisubmersible drilling rig in malaysia 
we performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above 
based on our analyses  we have concluded that these four rigs were not subject to impairment at december  at december   the remaining rigs in our fleet were currently working under contract  mobilizing to new locations or being actively marketed 
we do not believe that current circumstances indicate that there was an impairment of these rigs at december  management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 

table of contents personal injury claims 
our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per occurrence  with no aggregate deductible 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we estimate our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
we do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities 
however  if these earnings become subject to us federal tax  any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
we record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations  including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations

revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the gom decreased million during compared to excluding the ocean monarch  our gom fleet had approximately fewer rig operating days in  compared to the prior year  resulting in a million reduction in revenues generated by the fleet in the decrease in utilization is attributable to incremental downtime associated with contract preparation activities and subsequent relocation out of the gom of two of our high specification floaters  the ocean quest to brazil late in the first quarter of and the ocean valiant to angola during the third quarter of and scheduled surveys and related repairs 
in addition  two of our rigs were ready stacked for a total of days in compared to zero ready stack days in average operating revenue per day for our high specification floaters in this market excluding the ocean monarch increased to  in compared to  in  resulting in the generation of additional revenues of million 

table of contents operating costs for our high specification floaters in the gom increased by million in compared to to million 
the overall increase in operating costs in was primarily due to higher survey  repair and mobilization costs associated with a special survey for the ocean america 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower operating costs in the region for the ocean quest and ocean valiant  which we relocated to brazil and angola  respectively

operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the europe africa mediterranean region decreased million in compared to our north sea fleet both uk and norwegian sectors generated million less in revenues in compared to due to fewer rig operating days in compared to rig operating days decreased in as a result of the early termination of a drilling contract for the ocean nomad and intermittent work for the ocean guardian prior to its departure for the falkland islands  partially offset by reduced downtime for the ocean princess  which completed its special survey in early the impact of the reduction in rig operating days was partially offset by an increase in average operating revenue per day for our north sea fleet from  in to  in the ocean lexington operated offshore egypt during through august  and in september  the rig was mobilized to a shipyard in cadiz  spain for contract preparation activities in connection with a contract offshore brazil 
revenues generated by the ocean lexington in decreased million compared to due to fewer rig operating days in  partially offset by higher average operating revenue per day earned in as compared to the prior year 
at december   the ocean lexington was en route to brazil 
contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the europe africa mediterranean markets decreased million in compared to  primarily due to lower labor and personnel related costs for our rigs operating in the north sea  including the reversal of a previously recorded reserve for paid time off for our uk national employees  and reduced costs associated with regulatory surveys due to fewer rigs undergoing surveys in than in in addition  operating costs in this region decreased as a result of the relocation of the ocean lexington to a spanish shipyard in september

revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the gom decreased million during compared to average utilization decreased from in to in due to a decrease in demand for rigs in the gom  and resulted in a million decrease in revenues 
our jack up fleet in the gom had  ready and cold stacked days during compared to ready stacked days in in addition  we relocated the ocean summit to mexico for a contract with pemex at the beginning of the third quarter of the ocean tower  prior to being taken out of service due to damage sustained in a hurricane in the third quarter of  generated revenues of million in as a result of the depressed gom market  in we elected to cold stack and no longer actively market our three mat supported jack ups in this region 

table of contents contract drilling expense for our jack ups operating in the gom decreased million in compared to  primarily due to significantly reduced operating costs for the ocean tower prior to its sale in october and our three cold stacked rigs 
the decline in operating costs was partially offset by survey and repair costs for the ocean titan and ocean summit and demobilization costs for the ocean columbia associated with its relocation from mexico to the gom in the fourth quarter of for a shipyard project 
mexico 
revenue and contract drilling expense generated by our jack up rigs operating in mexico increased million and million  respectively 
the relatively stable revenues generated by our jack up fleet offshore mexico reflects incremental revenues generated by the ocean summit beginning in the third quarter of  partly offset by a reduction in revenues generated by the ocean columbia  which completed its contract with pemex at the beginning of the fourth quarter of revenues were further reduced  compared to  due to a contract extension for the ocean nugget until  but at a lower dayrate than it previously earned 
the increase in contract drilling expense was primarily due to contract preparations and customer acceptance of the ocean summit  as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs  partially offset by lower operating costs for the ocean columbia due to its relocation to the gom

the increased costs were partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the ocean heritage in europe africa mediterranean 
revenues generated by our jack up rigs operating in the europe africa mediterranean region decreased million in compared to  primarily due to an million reduction in revenues generated by the ocean spur in the ocean spur operated offshore egypt during both and  however  average operating revenue per day for the ocean spur decreased to  in from  in  while utilization increased to nearly in compared to in during  we recognized a million lump sum demobilization fee earned by the ocean spur upon completion of its initial contract offshore egypt 
the million increase in operating expense in the region in compared to is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs in for the ocean heritage  which relocated from qatar in the second quarter of south america 
our newly constructed jack up rig  the ocean scepter  began operating offshore argentina late in the third quarter of our operations offshore argentina generated million in revenues and incurred million in contract drilling expense during the ocean scepter completed its contract in july other contract drilling expense 
other contract drilling expense increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in labor and overhead costs associated with rig based training and a higher usage of fleet spare parts and supplies inventories 
bad debt expense 
in december  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve the uncollected balance of one of our customers in the uk that had entered into administration a uk insolvency proceeding similar to us chapter bankruptcy 
in december  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt and recovered million associated with the reserve for bad debts recorded in 
table of contents casualty loss

net gain on disposition of assets in includes a million gain on the sale of the ocean tower compared to aggregate net gains of million in on the sale and disposition of miscellaneous equipment 
interest income 
we earned interest income of million in compared to million in the million decrease in interest income is primarily the result of lower average interest bearing cash balances during compared to interest expense 
interest expense in and relates primarily to interest accrued on our outstanding indebtedness  net of capitalized interest  and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions

sources of liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves 
we may also make use of our million credit facility for cash liquidity 
see million revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments and marketable securities  representing our investment of cash available for current operations 
cash flows from operations 
our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the continuing global financial crisis and restrictions in the credit market  as well as the volatility in energy prices 
in general  before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may appear uncertain to us  we perform a credit review on that company 
based on that analysis  we may require that the customer present a letter of credit  prepay or provide other credit enhancements 
if a potential customer is unable to obtain an adequate level of credit  it may preclude us from doing business with that potential customer 
the global financial crisis could also have an impact on our existing customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate existing contract terms 
in addition  we may offer inducements to our customers to extend existing contracts 
for example  during the second half of  we reached an agreement with one of our customers in the gom for a second one year contract extension 
in exchange for the extension  we agreed to a varying dayrate structure which provides for lower dayrates during the four month period when the rig is restricted from operating during hurricane season  and higher dayrates at other times 
during the second quarter of  one of our customers sought short term financial relief with respect to an existing contractual agreement with us for a six well  one year minimum contract term  program that began in may as a result  we agreed to amend our existing contract with this customer  and in consideration of this amendment  we are to receive a  per day increase in the total contractual operating dayrate  to a total of  per day  for a minimum of the first days of the initial one year contract 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the customer is obligated to pay us  per day in accordance with our normal credit terms due days after receipt of invoice 
the remainder of the dayrate for the six well program minimum of days will be paid through the conveyance of a net profits interest  or npi  in a minimum of five developmental oil and gas producing properties covering six wells owned by the customer 
based on the current production payout estimate  we anticipate that the first payment from the conveyance of the npi will commence in early payments of such amounts  and the timing of such payments  are contingent upon such production and upon energy sale prices 
the residual days under the initial one year day contract will be deferred until the fourth quarter of when the customer will utilize the rig at the originally contracted dayrate and provide a up front escrow payment with the remaining to be paid in accordance with normal credit terms 
at december   the portion of our trade receivable that is expected to be paid from the npi was million and is presented as accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
these external factors which affect our cash flows from operations are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
for a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations  see overview industry conditions  forward looking statements and risk factors in item a of this report 
million revolving credit facility 
we maintain a million syndicated  senior unsecured revolving credit facility  or credit facility  for general corporate purposes  including loans and performance or standby letters of credit  that will mature on november

changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization  as defined in the credit facility  of not more than at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidation and dissolution  changes in lines of business  swap agreements  transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness 
based on our current credit ratings at december   the applicable margin on libor loans would have been 
as of december   there were no loans outstanding under the credit facility  however million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility 
liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  we may also make use of our credit facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes

some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations 
currency environments in which we have significant business operations include mexico  brazil  the uk  australia and malaysia 
when possible  we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
at present  however  only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
to the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the local currency  we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk 
our forward currency exchange contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which  for most of our contracts  is the average spot rate for the contract period

table of contents our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
loans under our million syndicated  senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to i the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or ii libor plus an applicable margin  varying from to  based on our current credit ratings 
as of december  and  there were no loans outstanding under the credit facility however  as of december  and  million and million  respectively  in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility 
our long term debt  as of december  and december   is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
it is customary for us to enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts may require us to exchange predetermined amounts of foreign currencies on specified dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which  for most of our outstanding contracts  is the average spot rate for the contract period 
as of december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding  in the aggregate notional amount of million  consisting of million in australian dollars  
table of contents million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner 
these contracts settle at various times through september at december   we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as a current asset of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of million in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  as a current liability of million in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and the following table presents our exposure to market risk by category interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fair value asset liability market risk december  december  in thousands interest rate marketable securities  a  a c  c long term debt  b  b foreign exchange forward exchange contracts receivable positions  d d  e e forward exchange contracts liability positions d  d  e  e a the fair market value of our investment in marketable securities  excluding repurchase agreements  is based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and b the fair values of our senior notes due july  and senior notes due september  are based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and december  the fair value of our zero coupon debentures is based on the closing market price of our common stock on december  and december  the fair values of our senior notes and senior notes are based on the quoted market prices on december  c the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of basis points at december  and d the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is based on both quoted market prices and valuations derived from pricing models on december  and e the calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk assumes an instantaneous decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their values at december  and  with all other variables held constant
