item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global enterprise software company that enables organizations to achieve higher levels of business performance by improving their operational responsiveness 
operational responsiveness is the ability of business processes and systems to respond to changing business conditions and customer interactions as they occur 
we offer a portfolio of best in class  real time business solutions providing visibility into business systems and processes  event processing to respond to business events that could affect performance  and business process management enabling businesses to continually improve business processes with no disruption to their business 
we also provide enterprise data solutions data access and integration and application development platforms for application development and management  and saas enablement 
we maximize the benefits of operational responsiveness while minimizing information technology it complexity and total cost of ownership 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
these operations are primarily conducted in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar significantly impact our results of operations 
in the first three quarters of fiscal  the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound  positively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
in the last quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  the strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies negatively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies positively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
the most significant challenge we faced in was the adverse global economic environment 
in addition to the impact of changes in the value of currencies described above  the adverse global economic environment during also resulted in reductions in sales of our major products and professional services engagements 
in fiscal we were organized in three reportable segments openedge  which includes the openedge products  enterprise infrastructure  which includes the apama  sonic  actional  orbix and fuse products  and data infrastructure  which includes the datadirect connect  datadirect shadow  progress dataxtend and objectstore products 
our product lines are synonymous with our reportable segments or business units 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reorganized into three business units  which meet the criteria for segment reporting  for fiscal application development platforms  enterprise business solutions and enterprise data solutions 
see item in this form k for further description of our business units 
we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal in fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of xcalia sa xcalia in february  mindreef  inc mindreef in june and iona in september xcalia became part of our data infrastructure reportable segment and mindreef and iona became part of our enterprise infrastructure reportable segment 
these acquisitions were designed to expand the size and breadth of our business and or add complementary products and technologies to existing products 
we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal on january   we acquired savvion  inc  a privately held business enterprise software company based in santa clara  california  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
savvion is a provider of business process management software 
the savvion products will become part of our enterprise business solutions segment 
we expect to continue to 
table of contents pursue additional acquisitions during the remainder of fiscal our acquisition strategy has been to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
we see the most significant risks for fiscal continuing to be the macroeconomic climate  which could cause our customers to delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us  and integration risk associated with our just completed acquisition of savvion 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of total revenue  and the percentage change in dollar amounts of such items compared with the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year

impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an interim impairment test was performed as circumstances indicated that an impairment may have occurred in our easyask reporting unit 
based on the interim impairment testing  it was determined that the easyask reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million  which was equal to the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the easyask reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded in any of our other reporting units as the fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values in fiscal in fiscal  it was determined that no such impairments of goodwill existed 
income from operations 
income from operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and remained the same as a percentage of total revenue at 
the increase in income from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to revenue increasing at a faster rate than operating expenses

see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for further information 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our cash and short term investments totaled million 
the increase of million since the end of fiscal was primarily due to cash generated from operations  a reclassification of auction rate securities ars to short term investments from non current assets totaling approximately million and the effect of year over year period end changes in foreign exchange rates on cash balances 
these ars were acquired as part of the acquisition of iona 
as described below  we have reclassified these securities on the balance sheet from long term investments to short term investments because we have the option to sell these securities at par value beginning june  these ars are classified as trading securities and all changes in the fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
in addition to the million of cash and short term investments  we had investments with a fair value of million related to ars that are classified as noncurrent 
these ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities that were marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at primarily or day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the remaining contractual maturities of these securities range from to years 
the underlying collateral of the ars consist of municipal bonds  which are insured by monoline insurance companies  and student loans  which are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp and by the monoline insurance companies 

table of contents beginning in february  auctions for these securities began to fail  and the interest rates for these ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering document 
at november   our ars investments totaled million at par value 
during fiscal  noncurrent investments totaling million were redeemed at par by the issuers and million were reclassified as short term investments  resulting in a net reduction of the par value of our ars investments classified as long term to million 
these ars are classified as available for sale securities 
for each of the ars classified as available for sale  we evaluated the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecasted the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or a redemption at par for each future auction period 
the weighted average cash flow for each period was then discounted back to present value for each security 
based on this methodology  we determined that the fair value of our non current ars investments is million  and we recorded a mark to market adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income of million to reduce the value of our available for sale ars investments 
with the exception of the ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona  we will not be able to access these remaining funds until a future auction for these ars is successful  we sell the securities in a secondary market  or they are redeemed by the issuer 
as such  these remaining investments currently lack short term liquidity and are therefore classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet at november  based on our cash and short term investments balance and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity associated with these ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the affected securities throughout the estimated recovery period  which we currently estimate to be two to five years 
we also believe that based on the current credit rating of the security issuer and the third party insurer underlying the investments  we will be able to collect contractual interest and principal payments and no loss due to credit exposure exists 
therefore  the impairment on these securities is considered only temporary in nature 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates significantly  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars through an impairment charge 
in november  we accepted a settlement offer in the form of a rights offering from ubs financial services ubs  the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of the ars that we hold 
the rights offering provides us with a put option to sell these securities at par value to ubs during a period beginning on june  since the settlement agreement is a legally enforceable firm commitment  the put option is recognized as a financial asset at its fair value of million in our financial statements at november   and is accounted for separately from the associated securities 
changes in the fair value of the put option  based on the difference in value between the par value and the fair value of the associated ars  are recognized in current period earnings 
we generated cash from operations of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the components of our cash flows from operations for fiscal years  and are as follows in thousands year ended november  net income depreciation  amortization and other noncash charges tax benefit deficiency from stock plans changes in operating assets and liabilities total the fluctuation in the change in operating assets and liabilities between fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of payments of assumed liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of iona and differences in the timing of maintenance renewal billings 
the fluctuation in the change in operating assets and liabilities between fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of differences in the timing of maintenance renewal billings 
our gross accounts receivable increased by million from the end of fiscal days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable increased year over year by four days to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal we target a dso range of to days 
we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the purchases in each fiscal year consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations 
we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year   shares for million in fiscal year  and  shares for million in fiscal year in september  the board of 
table of contents directors authorized  for the period from october  through september   the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  at such times that management deems such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
we had no acquisitions in fiscal years and in fiscal year  we completed three acquisitions at a total cost of million  net of cash acquired 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies were included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
in each case  the purchase price was paid in cash from available funds 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for further information on january   we acquired savvion  inc  a privately held company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
savvion is a provider of business process management software 
the savvion product lines will become part of our enterprise business solutions business unit 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of savvion will be included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was paid in cash from available funds 
we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions during the remainder of fiscal our acquisition strategy has been to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
in december  we announced a series of initiatives to better position us for long term growth and improved profitability 
to execute these initiatives  we announced that we are restructuring our sales  development and marketing organizations as well as other functions to better optimize operations and to improve productivity and efficiency 
as a result  during the first quarter of fiscal  we will have reduced our global workforce by approximately to positions  representing approximately to percent of our global workforce 
this workforce reduction is from substantially all functional units and across all geographies in which we operate 
we are also consolidating offices in various locations  including our offices in nashua  new hampshire and dublin  ireland during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of these workforce reductions and office consolidations  we currently expect to incur in the aggregate a pre tax charge in the range of approximately million to million 
the estimated aggregate charge consists of approximately million to million relating to our global workforce reduction  consisting primarily of severance and post employment benefits  and approximately million relating to our office consolidations 
we expect to record this charge primarily in the first quarter of fiscal substantially all of this charge will result in cash expenditures 
we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  announced acquisitions  lease commitments  restructuring obligations  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
revenue backlog our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
our backlog of orders not included on the balance sheet is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements 
our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
we typically fulfill most of our software license orders within days of acceptance of a purchase order 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize software license revenue upon shipment of the product  or if delivered electronically  when the customer has the right to access the software 
because there are many elements governing 
table of contents when revenue is recognized  including when orders are shipped  credit approval obtained  completion of internal control processes over revenue recognition and other factors  management has some control in determining the period in which certain revenue is recognized 
we frequently have open software license orders at the end of the quarter which have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of open software license orders may vary at any time  we generally do not believe that the amount  if any  of such software license orders at the end of a particular quarter is a reliable indicator of future performance 
in addition  there is no industry standard for the definition of backlog and there may be an element of estimation in determining the amount 
as such  direct comparisons with other companies may be difficult or potentially misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations as of november  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payment on long term debt operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total this liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments  if any  which we will make related to this liability are not known 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
such judgments can materially impact the amount of revenue that we record in a given period 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectability 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of 
table of contents customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we had goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
when we evaluate potential impairments outside of our annual measurement date  judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize either discounted cash flow models or other valuation models  such as comparative transactions and market multiples  to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of reporting units also requires management judgment 
we consider whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment based on the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by segment management 
we utilize undiscounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
income tax accounting we had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
management judgment is also required in evaluating whether a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  based on the weight of available evidence  indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
management judgment is also required in measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions would occur 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using either the current market price or the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount of stock based compensation would occur 
investments in debt securities we have approximately million at fair value par value of million in investments related to auction rate securities ars  of which million are classified as noncurrent at november  for each of our ars  we evaluate the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecast the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par  or a redemption at par  for each future auction period 
based on the results of this assessment  we record either a mark to market adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or an other than temporary impairment charge in other income in our statement of operations 
for ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona and classified as trading securities  we record all changes in fair value in current period earnings 
for further information regarding the ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
if we used different assumptions or the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our available for sale ars through an other than temporary impairment charge in current period earnings 
restructuring charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes to our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other market factors 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  and may result in revisions to established facility reserves 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards codification in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification is the official single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all existing accounting standards are superseded and all other accounting guidance not included in the codification will be considered non authoritative 
the codification does not change gaap 
we adopted the codification in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impact on our financial statements from the codification adoption was limited to disclosures  as all references to previous authoritative accounting literature were superseded by the codification 
determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard that provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
upon adoption  a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions of this standard 
as required  we adopted this standard on december   and there was no impact from adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
determination of the useful lives of intangible assets in april  the fasb issued a standard that amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
we adopted this standard on december   and there was no impact from adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued revised standards on business combinations and accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the revised standards will significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions 
the most significant changes from current practice will require companies to recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings  with certain exceptions  recognize preacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values  capitalize in process research and development assets  expense acquisition related transaction costs as incurred  and limit the capitalization of acquisition related restructuring as of the acquisition date 
in addition  changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of acquisition 
we adopted this standard on december   and believe this standard will have a material effect on the financial accounting for any acquisition completed after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years or interest rate resets of less than days and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale  except for certain ars which are classified as trading 
the available for sale classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date because changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
additionally  see further discussion regarding market risks with our investments in ars under liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 

table of contents we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
certain assets and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk 
our objective for holding derivatives is to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency risk 
we periodically monitor our foreign currency exposures to enhance the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  british pound  brazilian real  japanese yen  south african rand and australian dollar 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we enter into certain derivative instruments that may not qualify for hedge accounting 
although the derivatives we have entered into do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we generally use foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically a portion of forecasted international cash flows for up to one year in the future 
all foreign currency option contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the balance sheet at the end of each reporting period and expire within one year 
in fiscal  losses of million on foreign currency option contracts  primarily representing premiums paid on expired contracts  were recorded in other income expense  net in the statement of operations 
we also use forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge the net assets of our international subsidiaries 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the balance sheet at the end of each reporting period and expire within days 
in fiscal  gains of million from realized net gains and changes in the fair value of our forward contracts were recognized in other income in the statement of operations  primarily offset by unrealized losses on the offsetting positions
