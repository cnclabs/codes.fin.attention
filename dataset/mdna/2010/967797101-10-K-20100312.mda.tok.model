item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
general the primary objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the wilber corporation and its subsidiary for each of the years in the two year period ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes presented in part ii  item  of this document 
our financial performance is heavily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on our loans and investment securities less the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  investment securities gains losses  service charges on deposit accounts  trust and investment service fees  commission income  the net gain on sale of loans  the increase in the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance  gain on sale of insurance agency subsidiary  other service fees and other income 
our noninterest expenses consist of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing  professional fees  fdic premium assessment  collection expense  other miscellaneous expenses and income taxes 
results of operations are also influenced by general economic conditions particularly changes in financial markets and interest rates  competitive conditions  government policies  changes in federal or state tax law  and the actions of our regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions deteriorated further  additional provisions for loan losses would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s nonperforming loans and potential problem loans have a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management has concluded that the evaluation of collateral values was reasonable under the circumstances for each of the reported periods  if collateral valuations were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan losses would also require an additional provision for loan losses 
our policy on the allowance for loan losses is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan losses is included in part ii  item ci  of this document 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements provided in part ii  item  of this document to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
in june the fasb issued two new accounting standards  which change the way entities account for securitizations and special purpose entities 
the first standard enhances the reporting for transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions 
it also requires companies to report where they have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets and eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity 
in addition  it changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures about all continuing involvements with transferred financial assets  including information about gains and losses resulting from transfers during the period 
this standard also requires additional year end and interim disclosures 
it became effective for our company on january  and must be applied to transfers that occurred before and after its effective date 
based on our current activities  adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
the second new standard amends a previous standard to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this standard also requires additional disclosures about the reporting entity s involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement as well as its effect on the entity s financial statements 
this standard also requires additional year end and interim disclosures 
it became effective for our company on january  based on our current activities  adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
k 
index in january fasb issued a clarification and amendment to its accounting standard regarding disclosure of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
the amendment requires companies to provide a separate disclosure for transfers in and out of levels and  including a description of the reasons for the transfer 
it also requires companies to report activity in level fair value measurements on a gross basis  including information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the amendments also clarify existing disclosures related to disaggregated reporting  model inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures are effective for the first quarter of  except for the gross reporting of level activity  which is effective beginning the first quarter of upon implementation  these amendments may result in additional disclosures in our interim and annual reports 
b 
performance overview for the year ended december  most of our earnings performance measures improved during  as compared to  including  net income  earnings per share  return on assets and return on equity 
we recorded million in net income during  as compared to million in  a million or increase between comparable periods 
similarly  earnings per share increased or  from in to in during return on assets and return on equity were and  respectively  as compared to and during  respectively 
the improvements in these key performance measures were largely driven by significant improvements in net interest income and noninterest income  offset  in part  by significant increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense 
during  net interest income improved significantly due to an increase in the average volume of loans outstanding  our highest yielding earning asset  and a significant decrease in the expense recorded on our interest bearing liabilities due primarily to a general decline in deposit funding costs 
the increase in noninterest income between and was largely attributed to a significant increase in net investment securities gains 
as interest rates dropped in and remained low during  the market value on many of our available for sale investment securities increased 
we sold or had called million of these available for sale securities throughout and recorded net investment securities gains totaling million  a million increase over we sold primarily mortgage backed securities where underlying mortgage rates were or higher  anticipating that market values would decline due to high levels of refinancing 
during  we recorded million in the provision for loan losses  as compared to million in  a million increase between the annual periods 
the significant increase in the provision for loan losses between the periods was attributable to a decline in the general credit quality of our loan portfolio between the periods 
total noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  a million or increase between the periods 
we recorded a million increase in our fdic premium assessment and million increase in employee benefits expense due to both increased pension and split dollar life insurance buy out settlement costs  between and the information provided in item  parts c through f that follow provide additional information as to the financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources of the company

financial condition i 
comparison of financial condition at december   and december please refer to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item  of this document 
summary of financial condition due to generally weak economic conditions during  we curbed our asset growth rate targets and focused the company s resources on increasing current period net income and shareholders equity 
due to these efforts  total assets decreased from million at december  to million at december   an million or decrease 
conversely  shareholders equity increased million or  from million at december  to million at december  between december  and the level of nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  delinquent loans  impaired loans and net charge offs increased 
although we did not originate or hold in the normal course of our business subprime or alt a residential mortgage loans or investment securities backed by subprime or alt a mortgage loans  and have not experienced any significant losses due to these practices  during we recorded increases in net loan charge offs on our consumer installment loans primarily secured by automobiles  commercial loans and commercial real estate loans 
due to the economic recession  increased rates of unemployment and a decline in the operating performance of many of our commercial borrowers business operations  the overall quality of our portfolio declined during if the credit quality of the loan portfolio weakened further  it could negatively affect the results of operations in future periods 
k 
index we monitor our liquidity position on a regular basis and do not unduly rely on the wholesale credit markets for our funding 
the substantial majority of our funding is provided through customer deposits 
for these reasons  we maintained adequate amounts of liquidity to fund our business operations throughout and expect this condition to be maintained in and beyond 
asset composition our assets are comprised of earning and nonearning assets 
earning assets include our investment securities  performing loans  interest bearing deposits at other banks and federal funds sold 
nonearning assets include oreo and other assets acquired as the result of repossession or foreclosure  nonperforming loans  facilities  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  noninterest bearing deposits at other banks and cash 
we generally maintain approximately to of our total assets in earning assets 
during the composition of our assets did not change significantly 
the earning assets to total assets ratio at december  was  as compared to at december  the total loans to total assets ratio was at december   as compared to at december  the investment securities portfolio  including trading  available for sale  held to maturity and other investments  comprised of our total assets at december   versus at december  total assets at december  total assets were million 
this compares to total assets of million at december  during  we tempered our asset growth plan and actively deleveraged the company 
this entailed targeting strategic reductions in the company s total deposits and borrowings in concert with decreases in selected asset categories 
the deleveraging plan was executed in an effort to mitigate risk and increase our capital position in light of challenging economic conditions 
by contrast  total assets increased million or during due to our expansion into new markets throughout the central and upstate new york marketplace and company wide focus on growth 
during  deposit liabilities decreased million or  from million at december  to million at december  on a combined basis  short term and long term borrowings also decreased million or between december  and december  our short term borrowings consist of overnight repurchase agreements between the bank and its business customers 
we attribute this decrease to a reduction in our business customers working capital levels  and to a lesser extent  interest rates paid on our repurchase agreements 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of trading  available for sale  and held to maturity securities 
the following table summarizes our trading  available for sale  and held to maturity investment securities portfolio for the periods indicated

between december  and december   our total investment securities portfolio including trading  available for sale  and held to maturity decreased million or 
during we received proceeds from sales  maturities and calls of securities totaling million  versus new purchases of million 
during  particularly during the third and fourth quarters  we actively reduced our total assets as part of our plan to deleverage the company and improve our earnings and capital ratios 
this included selling significant portions of our available for sale investment securities portfolio and realizing gains to increase net income and our regulatory capital levels 
during  we sold or had called million of available for sale securities  which represented approximately of our total available for sale securities balance at december  on a net basis  including purchases  sales and changes in fair value due to changes in market interest rates  the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased million or during  from million at december  to million at december  the estimated fair value of the investment portfolio is largely dependent upon the interest rate environment at the time the market price is determined 
as interest rates decline  the estimated fair value of bonds generally increases  and conversely  as interest rates increase  the estimated fair value of bonds generally decreases 
at december   the net unrealized gain on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
by comparison  at december   the net unrealized gain on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
although we sold or had called million of available for sale securities throughout and recorded gains on the sale totaling million  low market interest rates at december  resulted in a net unrealized gain on the available for sale securities portfolio 
during we continued to maintain a concentration in mortgage backed securities 
these included both mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at the end of  our mortgage backed securities portfolio comprised of the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio 
this compares to and at the end of and  respectively 
approximately of our mortgage backed securities were backed by the full faith and credit of the us government through a ginniemae guarantee 
of the remaining of our mortgage backed securities portfolio  or million at par value was guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac  which are us government sponsored enterprises 
only or million at par value of the mortgage backed securities portfolio was guaranteed by private label issuers rated aaa and aa by moodys 
k 
index although of our mortgage backed securities were guaranteed by us government agencies and us government sponsored enterprises  they are susceptible to prepayment risk 
for example  if residential mortgage interest rates dropped significantly  the yield on our mortgage backed securities would likely decline 
when mortgage rates are low  homeowners often refinance their existing mortgage loans or purchase new homes 
this increases the amount of principal payments we receive on our mortgage backed securities  which  in turn  increases the amount of net amortization expense we record as an offset to interest income  thereby decreasing the yield on these securities 
the overall credit quality of our debt securities is strong 
at december   of the securities held in our available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolios excluding notes issued directly by the bank to local municipalities were rated a or better by moodys credit rating services and were rated aaa 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  although the economic recession of has negatively affected the financial strength of most states and municipalities  the credit quality of our municipal bond portfolio remained strong at december  we purchase our municipal securities based on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing municipality and have not relied on the insurance enhancement attached to the security 
the following table summarizes the amounts at their par value and associated credit rating on our municipal securities portfolio

index at december   the approximate weighted average life for all of the bank s available for sale and held to maturity debt securities was years 
by comparison  at december  the approximate weighted average life for the bank s available for sale and held to maturity debt securities was years 
these estimates i were provided by a third party investment securities analyst and are used to provide comparisons with other companies in the banking industry  ii are based upon the projected cash flows to the most likely call date of our investment securities portfolio taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the individual securities held by us  and iii may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
the increase in the weighted average life of the portfolio between the comparable periods was principally due to decreases in both anticipated cash flows from our mortgage backed securities portfolio and expected calls of municipal securities 
between december  and december   we received proceeds totaling million from principal payments and prepayments of the available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolio and sales of the available for sales security portfolio 
this represents a turnover of the investment securities portfolio during a significant portion of these proceeds were reinvested in pass through mortgage backed securities with longer average lives than those securities that amortized  matured or were sold during other investments at december  we held million of non marketable equity securities including million in fhlbny stock  a million equity interest in a small business investment company  meridian venture partners ii  l 
p  thousand of federal reserve bank of new york stock  thousand in new york business development corporation stock  and thousand in a small title insurance agency 
by comparison  at december   the estimated fair value of our nonmarketable equity securities totaled million  a thousand or net increase between the periods 
due to minimum membership stock requirements  we increased our capital stock in the fhlbny from million at december  to million at december   a thousand increase 
we own common stock of fhlbny which enables us to borrow funds under the fhlbny advance program and qualify for membership 
published reports indicate that certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system  which include eleven other regionally based federal home loan banks  may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of one of the banks in the federal home loan bank system  including fhlbny could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  given that there is no market for our fhlbny common stock  we believe that there is a risk that our investment could be deemed other than temporarily impaired at some time in the future 
in addition  it is possible that the fhlbny will discontinue or suspend its dividend payments to members in the event its regulatory capital levels diminish 
if either of these events occur  it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
interest bearing balances with banks and federal funds sold interest bearing balances with other banks and federal funds sold are the assets that we generally rely on to meet our daily funding needs 
prior to  in the normal course of our business  we primarily sold and purchased federal funds to and from other banks to meet these funding needs 
we only sold federal funds to well capitalized banks that carried strong credit ratings because federal funds sold are generally an unsecured obligation of the counterparty 
due to the global financial crisis in the second half of and related tightness in the inter bank credit markets  during the fourth quarter of the federal reserve banks announced a program whereby they would begin to pay interest on members required and excess reserves 
due to the safety of the federal reserve bank of new york  we began leaving most of our excess reserves on deposit at the federal reserve bank of new york  in lieu of selling unsecured federal funds to other commercial banks 
these excess reserves were classified as interest bearing balances with banks 
on a combined basis  at december  we held million in interest bearing balances at other banks and federal funds sold  versus million at december  due to significant volatility in our daily overnight funds position it is most appropriate to compare our average outstanding balances in these categories 
during our average overnight funds position  including federal funds sold and interest bearing balances at other banks  was million or of average total assets 
by comparison  during our average overnight funds position was million or of average total assets 
these levels were within management s informal target of maintaining approximately to million of overnight funds to meet the anticipated and unanticipated short term liquidity needs of the company 
loan portfolio general 
the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio was million during  as compared to million during  a million or increase 
during  we adopted a strategic plan that focused the company s resources on increasing earning assets by acquiring new lines of business and expanding our geographic markets into more populated and growing regions of upstate and central new york state 
in line with this strategy  in we acquired provantage  a new york state licensed mortgage bank located in saratoga county  new york 
in we established a representative loan production office in cicero  new york onondaga county and hired several experienced commercial and residential mortgage lenders 
we also aggressively marketed our small business  consumer  and residential mortgage loans in both our core rural markets and more densely populated markets  including johnson city  new york broome county and kingston  new york ulster county 
k 
index these efforts resulted in substantial growth in our total loans outstanding 
although we generated significant increases in interest income due to an increase in the volume of loans outstanding  we began to experience deterioration in most of our credit quality measures in early related  in part  to the slowing economy and its effect on our borrowers 
accordingly  we modified our strategic plan during the first quarter of in particular  we changed our focus to improve current period earnings  increase shareholders equity and raise our regulatory capital ratios in light of the economic recession 
this modification of our strategy resulted in only a moderate increase in loans outstanding between the periods ended december  and total loans increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase between the periods 
the following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio over the prior five year period

between december  and december  our commercial real estate portfolio increased million or 
at december   commercial real estate loans comprised of our total loan portfolio 
this compares to at december  throughout the period covered in the table above  we concentrated our efforts on opening new offices and hiring commercial lenders in large  more densely populated markets 
these efforts also contributed to the increase in the outstanding balances in our commercial loan portfolio 
at december   commercial loan balances outstanding totaled million 
this compares to million at december in addition  during the first quarter of we acquired provantage to improve our residential mortgage lending capabilities and increase the outstanding balances in our residential mortgage portfolio 
at december   the outstanding balance of our residential mortgage portfolio was million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase over the three year period since the acquisition of provantage 
during  we tightened our underwriting standards for consumer lending  principally installment type loans secured by new and used automobiles  due to increased loan charge off levels and challenges posed by the economic recession 
these actions  as well as a decline in demand for consumer credit  resulted in an or decrease in consumer loans outstanding between december  and december  the substantial majority of our consumer loans outstanding are indirect loans originated through automobile dealerships located in our central and upstate new york markets 
at december   our indirect automobile loan portfolio was comprised of  accounts  totaling million 
this compares to  accounts totaling million at december   a net decrease in accounts and an net decrease in indirect automobile loans outstanding 
the following table sets forth the amount of loans maturing in our portfolio 
the full principal amounts outstanding for all loans are shown based on their final maturity date

standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby and commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
since most of the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and december   standby and commercial letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   the fair value of the bank s standby letters of credit was not significant 
the following table summarizes the expirations of our standby and commercial letters of credit as of december  standby and commercial letters of credit expiration table commitment expiration of standby letters of credit in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years five years or greater total in addition to standby letters of credit  we have issued lines of credit and other commitments to lend to our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
these include home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans  commercial letters of credit  and other personal and commercial lines of credit 
at december  and december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments of million and million  respectively  representing a million or decrease period over period 
the significant decrease in the unfunded loan commitments was primarily due to a decrease in commercial real estate and other construction loan commitments  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in the unused portion of commercial lines of credit 
k 
index asset quality and risk elements general 
one of our key objectives is to maintain strong credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the following narrative provides summary information and describes our experience regarding the quality and risk elements of our loan portfolio 
delinquent loans 
at december   we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding nonperforming loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
by comparison  at december  we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding nonperforming loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
the increase in delinquent loans between the periods was principally due to an increase in the level of delinquent loans in the commercial real estate loan portfolio and  to a lesser extent  an increase in delinquency in the family residential mortgage loans 
we attribute the increase in delinquency in these sectors of the loan portfolio to the regional and national economic recession and the related difficulties it has placed on many of our borrowers ability to repay their loans in a timely manner 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans 
the following chart sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets for the periods stated 
table of nonperforming assets at december  in thousands loans in nonaccrual status residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total nonaccruing loans loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest troubled debt restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans includes only properties acquired through insubstance foreclosure  voluntary deed transfer  legal foreclosure or similar proceedings 
excludes properties acquired by the company for its own development 
total nonperforming loans  including nonaccruing loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase between the periods 
the increase in nonperforming loans between the comparable periods was principally due to an increase in nonperforming loans secured by commercial real estate properties 
in particular  during  three commercial real estate borrowers with an outstanding loan balance at december  totaling million were moved from accrual to nonaccrual status 
we recorded partial charge offs totaling thousand on the loans to two of these borrowers during and identified thousand of specific impairment in the allowance for loans losses on the third borrower at december these amounts were determined based on the estimated fair value of the properties we hold as collateral on these loans  less the estimated costs to sell 
the economic slowdown experienced in the central and upstate new york state markets in which we operate have negatively impacted the operating cash flows of many of our commercial real estate borrowers  including these three borrowers  which contributed significantly to the increase in nonperforming loans in this category during nonperforming loans were of total loans outstanding at december  and of total loans outstanding at december  k 
index impaired loans 
the following table provides information on impaired loans for the periods presented as of and for the year ended december  in thousands impaired loans allowance for impaired loans average recorded investment in impaired loans the level of impaired loans increased from million at december  to million at december  in spite of the significant increase in total impaired loans  only million of the impaired loans required specific reserve allocations totaling thousand 
by comparison  at december   million of the impaired loans had a specific allowance for loan loss reserve allocation of million 
we attribute the decrease in specific reserve allocations to management s general practice of obtaining strong collateral positions in the loans it originates 
in addition  during we recorded charge offs on several loans in which allowance for loan loss impairment amounts were identified in previous periods 
oreo and repossessed assets 
oreo and repossessed assets consists of real estate and other property formerly pledged as collateral on loans that have been acquired by us through foreclosure proceedings or repossession  as well as  real estate properties acquired by us through an acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or in substance foreclosure 
oreo is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the real estate  less estimated costs to sell 
between december  and december   we recorded a significant increase in oreo due largely to the in substance acquisition of a building formerly used to collateralize a loan to an automobile dealership 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans classified by our loan rating system as substandard 
potential problem loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard or a rating downgrade of loans previously carried in a less risky credit classification  particularly those with balances in excess of million 
we have identified through normal credit review procedures potential problem loans totaling million or of total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
this represents an million or increase in potential problem loans between december  and december  we generally attribute the increase in potential problem loans to the weak and or declining operating performance of many of our commercial borrowers due to difficult economic conditions 
management cannot predict economic conditions or other factors that may impact each potential problem loan 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual status  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
loan concentrations 
we classify our loan portfolio by collateral type and industry to determine and monitor the level of our loan concentrations 
we generally consider industry concentrations to exist when the total loan obligations outstanding loans and unfunded commitments to the industry exceed of the bank s total risk based capital 
the bank s total risk based capital at december  was million  which established our industry concentration threshold at million 
in addition  our policy on loan concentrations targets maximum industry concentration at of the bank s total risk based capital or million at december  we also review the geographic concentration and economic trends within each industry concentration to further segment and analyze the risk 
furthermore  the occ generally considers construction and development loans in excess of of the bank s risk based capital and nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans  including multi family and construction and development  in excess of of the bank s risk based capital million at december  to be concentrations of credit 
we did not exceed either of the occ benchmarks during and actively monitor our portfolio diversification by loan type  as well as industry type 
the following narrative summarizes our concentrations of credit 
k 
index at december  our outstanding loan and unfunded commitments to nonowner occupied commercial real estate borrowers  as defined in regulatory  guidance totaled million or of total risk based capital 
although non owner occupied commercial real estate loans have been identified by the occ as a higher risk loan type than owner occupied commercial real estate  our historical experience does not support this conclusion 
between december  and december  the level of delinquent loans  nonperforming loans and potential problem loans secured by owner and nonowner occupied commercial real estate has increased markedly due to difficult economic conditions 
commercial real estate secured delinquent loans to days past due excluding nonperforming loans increased from thousand or of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  to million or of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  similarly  nonperforming commercial real estate loans increased from million or of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  to million or of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  accordingly  we closely monitor the financial condition of borrowers whose loans are secured by commercial real estate 
due to weakening economic conditions  during we did not proactively seek new construction and development loans 
this decreased aggregate outstanding loan balances and unfunded commitments from million or of the bank s total risk based capital at december  to million or of the bank s total risk based capital at december  these levels are well within the of risk based capital benchmark established by the occ 
however  similar to our commercial real estate secured loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans in this loan type increased significantly between december  and december  nonperforming construction and development loans outstanding at december  totaling million were comprised of loans to two borrowers  as compared to no nonperforming loan balances at december accordingly  we closely monitor the progress of construction and the financial condition of borrowers whose loans are secured by undeveloped or underdeveloped commercial real estate 
at december  we had loans with million in total loan obligations to borrowers who operate in the automotive and other vehicle dealership industry 
the total loan obligations to this industry sector represented of the bank s total risk based capital and consisted of more than borrowers whose primary revenue is derived from the retail sale and servicing of new and used motor vehicles  motorcycles  commercial and or recreational vehicles 
loans to this industry consist of commercial real estate mortgages  equipment financing  working capital lines of credit  and inventory lines dealer floor plans 
we maintained dealer floor plan lines within this portfolio totaling million  million of which was outstanding at december  due to the significant risk posed by dealer floor plan lending  management monitors the dealer floor plan loans by conducting inventory reviews on a monthly basis 
at december   there were loans to borrowers within the automotive and other vehicle industry concentration with million in aggregate loan obligations outstanding that were classified as substandard 
consumer demand for new and used automobiles and recreational vehicles can vary significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors including  but not limited  to consumer spending  employment  inflation and fuel prices 
in addition  changes in market interest rates can affect consumer demand and inventory carrying costs 
we monitor these factors and adjust our lending policies and practices to borrowers in this sector in an effort to mitigate credit risk 
at december   we had loans with million in total loan obligations or of the bank s total risk based capital to borrowers who operate in the lodging industry  including hotels  motels  bed and breakfast inns  and a limited number of campgrounds and boarding houses 
at december  the loans to this industry sector were comprised of borrowers 
the single largest borrower has million in total loans outstanding on separate motel properties 
another borrowers have loans exceeding million 
the lodging properties that we finance are geographically dispersed throughout our market area and the broader statewide region 
many of these properties  however  are dependent upon tourism and have a seasonality that peaks in july and august 
in addition  the lodging industry  particularly the luxury segment  is affected by personal income  employment levels and corporate profits  all of which experienced declines during at december   million of these loans were deemed to be of acceptable risk pass rated by our management  with no delinquency noted 
five loans in the hotel motel sector with an outstanding balance of million were risk rated as substandard at december  due to insufficient cash flow generated by the operations of the business 
at december   loan obligations to the healthcare industry  including hospitals and medical practices  totaled million or of the bank s total risk based capital 
this portfolio was comprised of approximately loans including loans to hospitals 
the largest borrower in this industry was also the bank s largest borrower and had outstanding loans and unfunded commitments totaling million at december  within this industry sector only borrower with outstanding loans totaling thousand were nonperforming and classified as substandard 
at december   loan obligations to the residential and independent care facilities totaled million or of the bank s total risk based capital 
this portfolio was comprised of approximately loans at december  the residential  independent and assisted care living facilities depend significantly on medicare and other government reimbursement rates  which are projected to decrease moderately during one loan within this portfolio with an outstanding balance of million was classified as a special mention credit at december  k 
index at december   loan obligations to the finance and insurance industry totaled million or of the bank s total risk based capital 
this portfolio is comprised of loans at december  since the substantial majority of the loan obligations to this sector are to borrowers who provide short and long term financing for the construction and acquisition of real property  this industry sector is inherently dependent on the residential and commercial real estate markets 
for these reasons  the financing provided by our borrowers to their customers are closely monitored 
two loans within this industry sector with an outstanding balance totaling thousand were classified as special mention at december  although we have not identified strip malls as its own industry classification  and therefore  not subject to our single industry concentration limit  we have identified million of total loan obligations to borrowers in this sector at december  within this segment borrower with million in loans outstanding was classified as substandard 
a second borrower in this sector with an outstanding loan balance of thousand was classified as nonperforming 
at december   we had borrowers whose total loan obligations were equal to or exceeded million or of our total risk based capital 
in aggregate  these borrowers total loan obligations were million comprised of million in outstanding loans and million in unfunded commitments 
although these large relationships were dispersed among borrowers who operate in various industries  the decline in the financial condition of one or more of our large borrowers could significantly impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
at december   of these large borrowers  with total loans outstanding of million was classified as substandard 
in addition  there was an additional million in unfunded commitments to this borrower 
summary of loss experience charge offs and allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses  including charge offs and recoveries  for the periods indicated 
analysis of the allowance for loan losses table years ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year charge offs residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total charge offs recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the year to average loans outstanding during the year allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans k 
index we recorded million in net charge offs on loans during based on million of average loans outstanding during  this represents in net charge offs 
by comparison  during we recorded thousand in net charge offs on loans or on average loans outstanding of million 
during  we experienced a significant increase in the amount of net charge offs on loans secured by commercial real estate and  to a lesser extent  an increase in net charge offs on consumer loans 
the weak national and regional economy negatively affected the operating cash flows of many businesses and industries  including most sectors of the commercial real estate market 
the operating performance of a significant number of our commercial real estate borrowers weakened during causing significant increases in delinquent loans  nonperforming loans and ultimately charge offs 
net charge offs on consumer loans increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
we attribute the increase in net charge offs on consumer loans to a weak economy  higher levels of unemployment and underemployment and a moderate increase in the average outstanding balance of consumer loans between and during net charge offs on residential mortgage loans and commercial loans were low 
we recorded a thousand net recovery in residential mortgage loans and thousand in net charge offs on commercial loans 
we do anticipate  however  greater amounts of net charge offs on commercial loans during due to an increase in delinquency and increased operating difficulties among our commercial borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding at december  this compares to million or of total loans outstanding at december  during we identified a significant number and amount of substandard loans  which in combination with other weaker credit quality measures  including a significant increase in nonperforming loans  required an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
we recorded million in the provision for loan losses during due to these factors  an increase in substandard loans and a weakened credit and economic environment 
by comparison  we recorded million in the provision for loan losses during the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans decreased from at december  to at december  during  we charged down the balances on several nonperforming loans  which reduced the allowance for loan losses and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans to 
most of these charge downs included specific impairment amounts identified in previous periods 
both our management and board of directors deemed the allowance for loan losses adequate at december  and december  in spite of overall weaker loan quality during and an increase in total impaired loans to million we only identified thousand of specific reserves on impaired loans at december  of the million of impaired loans  only million of the impaired loans required specific allowance for loan loss reserve allocations 
by comparison  at december   million of the million in impaired loans had a specific allowance for loan loss reserve allocation of million 
this means that at december   we allocated million of the allowance for loans losses to factors other than specifically identified loan impairment amounts  versus million at december  this represents a million or increase attributed to these other factors  including increases in charge offs  nonperforming  delinquent and potential problem loans 
we attribute the decrease in specific reserve allocations to our general practice of obtaining strong collateral positions in the loans we originate 
our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the credit quality of the loan portfolio  our historical loss experience  current economic conditions  current and past underwriting and credit administration practices 
however  because the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses and is based on management s experience and assumptions  there is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
actual loan losses in excess of the allowance for loan losses would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
we allocate our allowance for loan losses among the loan categories indicated in the following table 
although we estimate and allocate probable losses by category of loan  this allocation should not be interpreted as the precise amount of future charge offs or a proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories 
additionally  since management regards the allowance for loan losses as a general balance  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance represented by the allocation is presented below for the periods indicated

in addition  due to weak economic conditions  including higher vacancy rates on commercial real estate properties  we raised the allocation amounts in this sector of the portfolio 
between december  and december   the allocation for commercial real estate loans increased from million or of the allowance for loan losses to million or of the allowance for loan losses 
conversely  a smaller proportion of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to commercial loans due to a decrease in the historical loss factor applied to this sector of the portfolio  offset  in part  by an increase in allocation amounts due to weak economic conditions 
the change in the allowance for loan loss amounts allocated to the residential real estate loans and consumer loans were generally due to changes in the composition of our loan portfolio 
during the outstanding balance of consumer loans  as well as the amounts allocated in the allowance for loan losses for consumer loans  decreased 
conversely  the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans and the amounts allocated to the allowance for loans losses for residential mortgage loans  increased 
other nonearning assets and bank owned life insurance cash and due from banks 
in order to operate the bank on a daily basis  it is necessary for us to maintain a limited amount of cash at our teller stations and within our vaults and atms to meet customers demands 
in addition  we always maintain an amount of check and other presentment items in the process of collection or float 
we are also required to maintain minimum noninterest bearing target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december   we maintained million or of total assets in these categories of nonearning assets 
this compares to million or of total assets at december  premises and equipment 
the net book value of premises and equipment decreased thousand or  from million at december  to million at december  during we did not purchase  dispose or sell any company or bank premises 
the decrease in premises and equipment between december  and december  was due principally to an increase in the accumulated depreciation on the company s equipment 
bank owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance at december  was million  as compared to million at december   a thousand or increase 
throughout  the bank held policies on former and current members of the bank s senior management 
the cash surrender value on each policy was increased throughout the year at the net crediting rate applied by the various insurance carriers 
the policies were issued by five life insurance companies who all carry strong financial strength ratings 
the net crediting rates applied on each policy were determined by each insurance carrier based on the performance of their general account 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill was unchanged between december  and december  during we did not acquire any new businesses  nor did we incur any impairment on previous acquisitions 
goodwill totaled million at december  and the company has only one reporting unit 
annually we test the company s goodwill for impairment 
based on our testing  no impairment was warranted during should our common stock value trade consistently below our book value  or other triggering event  we would re evaluate the amount of goodwill through an impairment test 
if impairment is warranted  the amount would be recorded through the income statement as a reduction to current period earnings 
k 
index during other intangible assets decreased thousand  from thousand at december  to thousand at december  the decrease was due to the amortization of core the deposit intangible asset recorded in prior period bank branch acquisitions 
pension asset 
at december   our pension plan assets exceeded our pension plan liabilities by million resulting in the recording of a pension asset 
by comparison at december   our pension plan liabilities exceeded our pension plan assets by thousand  resulting in a plan liability 
the swing between a pension liability at december  and pension asset at december  was due to several factors 
during  the assets held by our pension plan generated strong investment returns 
in addition during the fourth quarters of and  we contributed million and million  respectively  toward the plan 
the increase in the plan s assets due to these factors was offset  in part  by an increase in the plan participant liability 
see note of the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this document for additional detail on the company s defined benefit pension plan 
other assets 
other assets are principally comprised of oreo  interest receivable  prepaid taxes  prepaid insurance  prepaid fdic insurance premiums  computer software  net deferred tax assets  deferred taxes on investment securities  deferred taxes on the pension plan  other assets  returned rejected check items  other prepaid items  other intangible assets and other accounts receivable 
other assets increased million or  from million at december  to million at december  the substantial increase in other asset between the periods was due in large part to our fdic prepaid deposit insurance assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  the fdic adopted a final rule to assess and collect from its member institutions a special prepaid deposit insurance assessment to replenish its deposit insurance fund 
the special prepaid assessment was collected from member institutions in december and included estimated quarterly fdic insurance premiums for the fourth quarter of and for all quarterly periods in  and the bank s prepaid deposit insurance assessment totaled million at december  and will be amortized quarterly during  and until it is fully exhausted 
composition of liabilities deposits 
deposits are our primary funding source 
at december  and december  deposits represented approximately of our total liabilities 
total deposits at december  were million 
this compares to million at december   a million or decrease 
during  we tempered our asset growth plan and actively deleveraged the company 
this entailed targeting strategic reductions in certain categories of deposit liabilities  as well as selected asset categories 
the deleveraging plan was executed in an effort to mitigate risk  increase net income and boost our capital position in light of challenging economic conditions 
the execution of the plan included significant interest rate reductions in all of our deposit liability categories  including  savings accounts  now accounts  money market deposits and certificates of deposit 
there is an inherent lag between our deposit pricing actions and the flow of customer deposits 
for this reason and our growth strategy  our average outstanding deposit balances increased from million in to million in conversely  due to the implementation of our deleveraging strategy our year end deposit liability balances dropped below year end deposit liability balances 
during the composition of our deposit liabilities changed significantly 
in particular  our interest bearing nonmaturity deposit balances increased million or between december  and december   while our certificate of deposit portfolio including certificates over and under thousand decreased million or over the same period 
we decreased the interest rates paid on our short term certificates of deposit and maintained relatively competitive interest rates on our money market and now accounts during our depositors reacted by increasing their now and money market deposit account balances  and to a lesser extent  savings accounts  while reducing the funds invested in certificates of deposit  particularly those with maturities of one year or less

total borrowed funds consist of short term and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase with our customers and other third parties 
long term borrowings consist of monies we borrowed from the fhlbny for various asset funding requirements and wholesale funding strategies 
total borrowed funds were million or of total liabilities at december   as compared to million or of total liabilities at december   an million or decrease between the periods 
short term borrowings decreased from million at december  to million at december   a million or decrease 
the decrease was principally due to a decrease in customer repurchase agreement balances 
long term borrowings increased thousand between december  and december  during we secured million of new long term advances at the fhlbny  principally to fund the origination of new fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
this increase was offset by the repayment of million in amortizing fhlbny advances originated during the current and prior periods

summary 
we recorded net income and earnings per share of million and  respectively  for this compares to million in net income and in earnings per share in the million or increase in net income and increase in earnings per share between comparable periods were due to several factors 
we recorded significant increases in both net interest income and noninterest income in  as compared to the increase in net interest income totaling million or was due  in large part  to a significant increase in average loans outstanding our highest yield earning asset and a significant decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  due primarily to the low interest rate environment that prevailed in  we sold or had called million of our available for sale investment securities and recorded million in gains on the sale of these securities 
this compares to sales or calls on available for sale securities totaling million during and thousand in gains 
k 
index the improvements in net interest income and noninterest income were offset  in part  by significant increases in the provision for loan losses  noninterest expense and income taxes 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to the general deterioration in most of our loan quality metrics between comparable years  and the need to replenish the allowance for loan losses for charge offs recorded as determined by our allowance model 
the increase in noninterest expense between comparable years was largely attributable to significant increases in the fdic premium assessment  employee benefits expense  and to a lesser extent  salaries  computer service fees and loan collection expense 
our return on average assets and return on average equity were and  respectively  for  as compared to and  respectively  during our dividend payout ratio was during we declared and paid dividends totaling per share during on earnings per share of 
due to the need to preserve the company s capital resources  particularly in these uncertain economic times  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share for the last three quarters of this compares to a dividend per share in the first quarter of and all four quarters of  a decrease in the quarterly dividend 
net interest income 
net interest income is our most significant source of revenue 
net interest income is comprised of the interest and dividend income generated on our earning assets  including  but not limited to  loans and investment securities  less interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities  including  customer deposits and borrowings 
during  net interest income comprised of our total revenues net interest income plus noninterest income 
the remaining was due to noninterest income 
this compares to and  respectively  for the decrease in net interest income to total revenues between and was largely due to the significant increase in net gains recorded on the sale  maturity and call of the available for sale investment securities portfolio between periods 
the following asset and yield summary table  and rate and volume table and the associated narrative provide detailed net interest income information and analysis that are important to understanding our results of operations 
the following table summarizes the total dollar amount of interest income from average earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense and rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities

average loans include loans held for sale  net deferred loan fees and costs  nonaccrual loans and excludes the allowance for loan losses 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin  also known as the net yield on average interest earning assets  represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
k 
index the level of our net interest income is dependent on several factors including  but not limited to our ability to attract and retain deposits  our ability to generate and retain loans  regional and local economic conditions  regional competition  capital market conditions  the national interest rate environment  as well as our tolerance for risk 
throughout and  our net interest income was affected by all of these factors 
we recorded million in net interest income during  versus million during  a million or increase 
similarly  tax equivalent net interest margin increased from in to in the increase in net interest income and tax equivalent net interest margin between comparable years was due to a significant increase in our average outstanding earning asset balances  particularly loans  and a significant decrease in funding costs 
during we recorded million in interest income versus million in  a thousand or increase in spite of significant decreases in the yield on all categories of earning assets 
interest expense  by comparison  decreased million or  from million in to million in during  average outstanding earning assets increased million or  from million in to million in  while the average yield on our earning assets decreased basis points between comparable periods  from in to in during  we embarked on a market expansion and asset growth strategy 
the strategy included the hiring of several lending professionals and establishment of branch offices in greater syracuse and capital district markets of central and upstate new york 
although we curbed our growth strategy during the first half of  average earning assets increased between comparable years due to the inherent lag in implementing these strategies 
between september and december  the federal open market committee lowered the target federal funds interest rate by basis points  from to  due to a rapidly slowing national economy 
this  in turn  caused a decrease in the national prime lending rate  an interest rate to which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is indexed 
these actions  along with decreases in other short term interest rates  reduced the yield on all categories of our earning assets between comparable years  including federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits at other banks  investment securities and loans 
our strategy to grow the earning assets  with a special emphasis on loans  our highest yielding portfolio  counteracted the precipitous drop in earning asset yields between comparable years 
we recorded million of interest income on loans during  as compared to million in  a million or increase despite a basis point decrease in yield between the periods 
the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio was million in  as compared to million in  a million or increase  while loan yields decreased from in to in during  we hired several experienced commercial lenders to staff our cicero  new york office and continued to originate new loans in our core markets and the capital district 
these actions resulted in an increase in the average outstanding balance of loans in each successive quarter of and the first two quarters of  in spite of our decision to curb our growth strategy during the persistence of very low market interest rates throughout resulted in a drop in the average yield on loans 
we recorded million in interest income on our investment securities portfolio during by comparison  we recorded million in interest income on our investment securities portfolio during the decrease in interest income on the investment securities portfolio totaling million or was due primarily to decreases in both investment securities market yields and the average outstanding balance in our investment securities portfolio 
the average yield on the investment securities portfolio decreased from in to in  while the average outstanding balance of the portfolio decreased from million in to million in during  we experienced significant turnover in our investment securities portfolio due to sales  maturities or calls and increased the average outstanding balances of the loan portfolio 
these factors drove down the average outstanding balance of the investment securities portfolio 
in addition  the proceeds from these activities were reinvested into new investment securities at lower effective yields 
on a combined basis  we recorded thousand in interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks during this compares to thousand in interest income during the decrease in interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks between comparable years was principally due to a precipitous drop in market interest rates between and between and  the rate on all categories of interest bearing liabilities decreased 
the weighted average rate on all interest bearing liabilities totaled in  as compared to in similarly  total interest expense decreased million between comparable years in spite of a million or increase in average outstanding interest bearing liabilities 
we recorded million in total interest expense during  as compared to million in the significant decrease in market interest rates between comparable years allowed us to reduce the average rate paid on all categories of our interest bearing liabilities  including money market deposit accounts and time and other deposit accounts  our two largest and highest cost interest bearing deposit liabilities 
k 
index during  we recorded million of interest expense on our money market deposit accounts at an average rate of 
by comparison  during we recorded million of interest expense at an average rate of 
the basis point decrease in the average rate on these deposit liabilities was principally due to a significant reduction in the interest rate offered on our wealth management money market deposit account 
the average outstanding balance of money market accounts increased from million in to million in we attribute this increase to our depositors willingness to hold investable funds in readily available money market accounts and their corresponding reluctance to invest funds into certificates of deposit during a time when market interest rates for short term time deposits were at historical lows 
similarly  the interest expense recorded on time and other deposit accounts decreased million between comparable years 
during the average rate paid on time and other deposit accounts was  versus in  a basis point decrease 
as market rates for certificates of deposit remained very low during our maturing certificates of deposit were renewed or replaced by new certificates at lower rates of interest 
the average outstanding balance of time and other deposits decreased from million in to million in because certificate of deposit yields were low  which  we believe  caused our depositors to invest their funds into now and money market accounts that could be accessed quickly without penalty 
between and  the average outstanding balance of now accounts increased million or  but the average interest rate paid decreased basis points  from during to during as a result of these changes  interest expense on now accounts decreased from million in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease between comparable years 
during  our municipal depositors increased the level of their operating account balances held in now accounts due to significant reductions in short term certificate of deposit rates 
the effective yield on municipal now accounts exceeded the effective yield on certificates of deposits with maturities of one year or less throughout most of between comparable years  the average rate paid on savings accounts decreased from in to in although the interest rate offered on savings accounts were at historical lows throughout  the average outstanding balance in savings accounts increased slightly from million during to million during  a million or increase 
interest expense on savings accounts decreased from thousand in to thousand in we attribute the slight increase in average outstanding savings account deposits between and to our depositors reluctance to invest their funds in short term certificates of deposit at historically low rates of interest 
interest expense on borrowings decreased slightly from million during to million during  a thousand or decrease 
although average total borrowings outstanding increased between periods  the average rate paid on borrowings decreased from in to in due to a precipitous decrease in the interest rates paid on repurchase agreements with our customers 
rate and volume analysis 
the following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume change in average balance multiplied by prior year rate  changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and the net change in net interest income 
the net change attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate has been allocated to each in proportion to the absolute dollar amount of change

index rate and volume table year ended december  vs 
rate volume total in thousands earning assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits securities loans total earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts money market accounts now accounts time other deposit accounts borrowings total interest bearing liabilities change in net interest income the purpose of a rate volume analysis is to identify the dollar amount of change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates versus changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased million between and between the periods we recorded a thousand increase in interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income between comparable periods was driven by a significant increase in the average loan balances outstanding 
the decrease in interest expense was driven by a reduction in the average interest paid on all categories of interest bearing liabilities  offset  in part  by an increase in the average volume of money market accounts  now accounts and borrowings  and to a much lesser extent  savings 
between september and december  the federal open market committee lowered the federal funds target rate by basis points due to a weakening national economy 
the precipitous drop in the federal funds rate and other market interest rates caused a significant reduction in both our interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs 
conversely  the strategy adopted in to increase the company s earning assets contributed to increases in both interest income and interest expense due to volume factors 
more specifically  net interest income increased million between the years due to volume factors  as compared to million due to rate factors 
between and  the volume of earning assets on a net basis increased million  including a million increase in average loans outstanding between the periods 
throughout  and the first quarter of  we focused our personnel and marketing resources on increasing the outstanding balances in our loan portfolio with the goal of increasing interest income 
due to these efforts  we steadily increased the average outstanding balances in our loan portfolio 
although we curbed the rate of asset growth during the last three quarters of  on a comparable period basis  average outstanding loan balances increased from million in to million in the growth in the average outstanding loan balances contributed million of additional interest income between comparable years 
this improvement  however  was offset by a million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in the average yield on loans between comparable years as market interest rates dropped 
due to these two factors  the interest income recorded on loans increased million between comparable years 
we recorded only thousand in interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks during during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve bank of new york changed its long standing policy of not paying interest on required and excess reserves held by member institutions to paying interest on required and excess reserves 
given the comparable federal reserve deposit interest rate and the open market rates for federal funds sold during  we invested the large majority of our overnight excess reserve balances at the federal reserve bank of new york 
due to these factors  the combined interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits decreased thousand  thousand attributable to rate and thousand attributable to volume 
k 
index the interest income recorded on the investment securities portfolio decreased million between and due to both rate and volume factors 
during the last three quarters of and the first two quarters of  we significantly increased the average volume of loans outstanding 
to help fund this growth in loans outstanding and take advantage of an increase in the value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio  we reduced our average investment securities balances outstanding by million between comparable years 
similarly  due to a declining interest rate environment and the high level of turnover within the investment securities portfolio during  the yield on our investment securities portfolio decreased from in to between comparable years  the interest income earned on investment securities decreased million due to volume and thousand due to rate factors 
we recorded million in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts during  as compared to million in we offered lower rates of interest on new and renewed certificates as interest rates dropped between the later part of and december  as interest rates dropped  many of our customers opted to deposit their funds in nonmaturity deposit accounts  primarily money market deposit accounts 
the decrease in interest rates and the corresponding decline in time and other deposit account balances drove down interest expense million or between comparable periods  million due to rate and thousand due to volume 
interest expense on money market deposit accounts decreased thousand between and as short term interest rates decreased between comparable periods  we lowered the interest rate paid on money market deposit accounts causing a million decrease in interest expense due to rate factors 
between comparable periods  however  we increased the average volume of money market accounts outstanding due to an increase in municipal deposits and our wealth management accounts 
this increased interest expense on this deposit liability portfolio thousand between comparable years due to volume factors 
as interest rates dropped over the last several quarters we decreased the interest rates paid on statement savings and passbook savings accounts  resulting in a thousand decrease in interest expense between and this was offset  in part  by an increase in interest expense on savings accounts due to an increase in average outstanding balances totaling thousand 
the average rate paid on now accounts decreased from in to in despite the decrease in the average rate paid on these accounts  the average outstanding balance in the now account portfolio increased from million in to million in due principally to an increase in municipal deposit accounts 
between comparable periods  interest expense on now accounts decreased thousand 
the increase in the volume of now accounts increased interest expense thousand between comparable periods  but was offset by a thousand decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in rate 
in the second half of  we secured long term borrowings to fund our long term fixed rate residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans 
the interest rates on these new long term borrowings were generally less than the interest rates on maturing long term borrowings 
in addition  due to lower market interest rates between and  we decreased the average rate paid on our customer repurchase agreements 
these actions caused a drop in our average cost of borrowings from in to in an increase in the average volume of borrowings increased interest expense by thousand  while the decrease in the average rate paid on borrowings decreased interest expense by thousand  resulting in a thousand net decrease in interest expense on borrowings 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded million in the provision for loan losses during this compares to million during  a million increase 
during  we experienced a significant decline in most of our loan quality metrics  nonperforming loans  delinquent loans  impaired loans and potential problem loans 
this trend  coupled with deteriorating economic conditions and a significant increase in net charge offs during  resulted in a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses 
we recorded million in net charge offs during versus thousand in net charge offs in  a million increase 
net charge offs to average loans outstanding totaled in  as compared to in  a basis point increase 
loans to days delinquent increased from million or of total loans outstanding at december  to million or of total loans outstanding at december  nonperforming loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding at december   as compared to million or of total loans outstanding at december  this represents a million increase in nonperforming loans and a basis point increase in nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding between the periods 
although total impaired loans increased from million at december  to million at december   the allowance for impaired loans decreased from million at december  to thousand at december  lastly  potential problem loans increased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december  k 
index noninterest income 
noninterest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  net investment securities gains losses  net gain on sale of loans  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees and other income 
in addition  during the first two quarters of we held a majority ownership interest in an insurance agency subsidiary 
during that period we recorded commission income on the policies sold through the agency  as well as a gain on the sale of the agency in the second quarter of we recorded million in noninterest income during  versus million in  a million or increase between comparable years 
the largest contributing factor toward the increase in noninterest income was a substantial increase in net investment securities gains between comparable periods  and to a lesser extent  increases in service charges on deposit accounts  the net gain on sale of loans and other service fees 
we recorded million in net investment securities gains during  as compared to thousand in service charges on deposit accounts  net gain on sale of loans and other service fees increased thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  between and the improvements in these items were offset  in part  by a thousand decrease in trust fees  a thousand decrease in income on bank owned life insurance and a thousand decrease in other income

and finally  between comparable years the average outstanding balance of our insurable deposits increased substantially in connection with the bank s growth strategy

liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund our current and planned expenditures 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position 
accordingly  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis through our daily funds management process 
this includes maintaining the appropriate levels of currency throughout our branch system to meet the daily cash needs of our customers  balancing our mandated deposit or reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank of new york  maintaining adequate cash balances at our correspondent banks  and assuring that adequate levels of federal funds sold  liquid assets  and borrowing resources are available to meet obligations  including reasonably anticipated daily fluctuations 
the following list represents the sources of funds available to meet our liquidity requirements 
our primary sources of funds are denoted by an asterisk

the monthly evaluation report  known as the liquidity contingency scorecard  is reviewed by the alco and the bank s board of directors 
the report provides management with various ratios and financial market data that are compared to limits established within the bank s asset and liability management policy 
it was designed to provide an early warning signal for a potential liquidity crisis 
based on the limits established in our asset and liability management policy  at december  the bank maintained adequate levels of liquidity

however  our overall liquidity position  including our off balance funding facilities  improved significantly between december  and december  because in we were approved to participate in a nationally recognized fdic approved brokered certificate of deposit program 
the unused portion of the facility allows us to bid weekly for fdic insured certificate of deposits as long as we continue to meet program conditions including maintaining our well capitalized status 
the certificate of deposit terms range from weeks to years with higher levels of availability in the shorter term pools 
at december  we maintained million in cash and cash equivalents  million in unpledged available for sale at estimated fair value and held to maturity investment securities  and million of readily available lines of credit at other banks excluding the brokered certificate of deposit line of credit to fund any anticipated or unanticipated growth in earning assets 
this compares to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in unpledged available for sale at estimated fair value and held to maturity investment securities  and million of readily available lines of credit at other banks on december  in aggregate  these potential funding sources provided million of short and long term liquidity at december   as compared to million at december   a million increase between periods 
our total loan to total asset ratios of at december  and at december  were low relative to those of our comparative peer group of financial institutions 
our commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit decreased between december  and december  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit totaled million at december   versus million at december   a million or decrease 
the decrease between periods was principally due to decreases in commitments to fund commercial real estate construction loans 
our experience indicates that draws on the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we  however  will closely monitor our liquidity position over the next several quarters to assure adequate levels of short term funding are available to fund our off balance sheet commitments 
on a quarterly basis we also prepare a forward looking day sources and uses report to determine future liquidity needs 
based on this report  our deposit retention experience  anticipated loan and investment funding and prepayment activity  the product offerings of our competitors  the level of interest rates  the level of regional economic activity  and our current pricing strategies  we anticipate that we will have sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our funding commitments over the next several quarters prospectively 
f 
capital resources and dividends the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors

during  we recorded net income of million 
in addition  we recorded a decrease in the net actuarial loss on our defined benefit plan and split dollar life insurance benefit totaling thousand 
these were offset  in part  by cash dividend payments totaling million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to a decrease  net of tax in the market value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio 
and finally  during  we raised million of shareholders equity by reissuing our common stock  
par value  through a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan the plan 
the company registered  treasury shares with the sec under the plan and reissued  of these shares during under the plan  the company s registered shareholders may reinvest all or part of their dividend payments on each dividend payable date  and or purchase additional shares monthly through the optional cash investment feature 
in addition  prospective shareholders may purchase the shares directly from the company 
during the fourth quarter of  we offered a discount on shares issued by the company through december  the maximum amount of optional cash investments that can be made by individual participants is  in any calendar year 
the company and the bank are both subject to regulatory capital guidelines as established by federal bank regulators 
under these guidelines  in order to be adequately capitalized the company and the bank must both maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets and tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of 
tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity less intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income 
total capital for this risk based capital standard includes tier capital plus allowable portions of the company s allowance for loan losses 
similarly  for the bank to be considered well capitalized  it must maintain a tier capital to average assets ratio of  a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
the company exceeded all capital adequacy guidelines  and the bank exceeded all well capitalized guidelines at december  and december  in addition  the bank s board of directors has established a minimum capital policy that exceeds well capitalized regulatory standards to ensure the safety and soundness of the company s banking subsidiary 
the bank s tier capital to average assets ratio  tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at december  were  and  respectively 
this compares to  and  respectively  at december  the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its subsidiary bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries  as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
at december   under statutory limitations  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiary to the company without special regulatory approval was approximately million 
these statutory limitations notwithstanding  the bank entered into an informal agreement with the occ during the third quarter of  which requires the bank s board of directors to obtain occ approval prior to declaring a dividend 
the ability of the company and the bank to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies and practices  capital guidelines  and applicable laws
