item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions improved through the course of the year began with a sharp decline in customer demand that resulted from the worldwide economic downturn and difficult credit markets 
demand gradually improved after the first quarter as customers reduced their inventory destocking and as end market demand began to recover 
net sales in declined by from the decline in sales compared with was greater during the first half of the year  driven by reduced demand in most end market applications including automobiles  construction  electronics and appliances 
quarterly sales improved sequentially during and by the fourth quarter sales were higher than in the prior year period when demand began to be adversely affected by worldwide economic issues 
for the full year  sales declined in each segment and in all regions 

table of contents beyond the fundamental customer demand for our products  the factors that influenced results included the following cost and expense reduction initiatives 
these initiatives included restructuring actions that consolidated manufacturing facilities and reduced employee positions 
the actions resulted in restructuring and other charges  and also contributed to lower operating costs and expenses 
reduced impairment of goodwill and other assets 
increased interest expense 
interest expense increased due to higher interest rates and increased borrowing levels  including borrowing to satisfy requirements for cash collateral related to precious metal consignment agreements 
borrowing levels were reduced in november as a result of using a portion of the proceeds from an equity offering to reduce debt 
gross margin declined in  compared with  driven by the decline in sales 
primarily because of our cost reduction efforts  gross margin percentage increased compared with the prior year period 
cost reductions included staffing reductions  plant closures  benefit reductions and unpaid furloughs for certain salaried employees 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense declined during the year 
the decline was primarily due to expense reduction efforts that resulted in lower staffing levels and reductions in spending in response to our reduced sales levels 
an increase in pension expense partially offset the effects of the expense reduction actions 
we recorded an million impairment of goodwill related to our pharmaceuticals business during the impairment was triggered by changes made to the assumptions used to determine valuation under the market approach 
the impairment charge recorded in was substantially smaller than the charge for goodwill and asset impairments in restructuring charges were recorded during  primarily related to manufacturing rationalization activities in europe and other cost reduction activities 
restructuring charges were lower than in the prior year period 
interest expense increased during compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher average borrowing levels 
as a result of an amendment to our credit facilities that was signed in march  the interest rate on our term loans and revolving credit borrowings increased  contributing to the higher interest expense 
the requirement to provide cash collateral for precious metal leases was a major contributor to our increased borrowing levels 
in november  we sold common stock in an equity offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt and will be used to fund future restructuring actions and strategic growth initiatives 
we recorded a loss from continuing operations in the loss was due to a decline in gross profit resulting from reduced sales driven by the worldwide economic downturn  as well as restructuring charges  impairment charges  and increased interest expense 
lower selling  general and administrative expense  compared with the prior year period  helped to reduce the loss from continuing operations 
during  we sold our fine chemicals business 
results related to our fine chemicals business  which had previously been combined with the results from our pharmaceuticals business and reported as other businesses  are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
outlook general economic conditions around the world deteriorated sharply in late and early as a result  demand for our products declined 
during  particularly in the second half of the year  there was modest improvement in demand  however our sales and manufacturing volumes continue to be less than they were prior to the economic downturn 
during  our customers reduced their inventories  including inventories of our products  which contributed to the decline in demand for our products 
it appears that customers inventories have stabilized  and inventory destocking largely has been completed 
in aggregate  demand for our products has improved since the first quarter of and is expected to improve modestly in future quarters 
however  economic conditions are expected to remain challenging  and there likely will be disparities in the timing and rate of recovery of different regions and end markets we serve 

table of contents we expect to continue to record charges associated with our current and future restructuring programs  including the restructuring efforts funded by our equity offering 
the restructuring programs are intended to further rationalize our manufacturing operations in europe  align our worldwide operations to reduced customer demand  and lower our selling  general and administrative expense 
factors that could adversely affect our future financial performance are contained within risk factors included under item a

these covenants are negotiated with the group of lenders 
the covenants include requirements for a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
definitions of the covenants and our required performance can be found in our amended and restated credit facility  which was filed as exhibit to our current report on form k dated october  our ability to meet these covenants is primarily driven by our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  our total debt  and our interest payments 
our total debt is primarily driven by cash flow items  including net income before amortization  depreciation  and other noncash charges  our capital expenditures  requirements for deposits from participants in our precious metals program  our customers ability to make payments for purchases and the timing of such payments  and our ability to manage inventory and other working capital items 
our interest payments are driven by debt level  external fees  and interest rates  primarily prime and libor 
domestic receivable sales program we have an asset securitization program for substantially all of ferro s us trade accounts receivable 
this program accelerates cash collections at favorable financing costs and helps us manage the company s liquidity requirements 
in june  we replaced the prior program with a new program that expires in june and reduced the program s size from million to million 
we legally sell these trade accounts receivable to ferro finance corporation ffc  which finances its acquisition of trade receivable assets by selling undivided variable percentage interests in the receivables to certain purchasers under the program 
advances by the purchasers are secured by  and repaid through collections on  the receivables owned by ffc 
ffc and the purchasers have no recourse to ferro s other assets for failure of payment of the receivables as a result of the lack of creditworthiness or financial inability to pay of the related obligor 
ffc is a wholly owned subsidiary  which until december was a qualified special purpose entity qspe and  therefore  was not consolidated 
in december  ffc ceased to meet the requirements of a qspe and is included in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  this program is now accounted for as an on balance sheet arrangement 
at december   ferro s consolidated balance sheet includes outstanding trade accounts receivable legally transferred to ffc of million and short term debt from advances by the purchasers for their interests in those receivables of million 
after reductions for non qualifying receivables  we had million of additional borrowings available under the program at december  off balance sheet arrangements international receivable sales programs 
we maintain several international programs to sell trade accounts receivable 
at december   the commitments supporting these programs  which can be withdrawn at any time  totaled million  the amount of outstanding receivables sold under these programs was million  and ferro had received net proceeds under these programs of million for outstanding receivables 
based on available and qualifying receivables  there was no additional availability under these programs at december  consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
in the production of some of our products  we use precious metals  primarily silver for electronic materials products and gold for color and glass performance materials products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements generally referred to as our precious metals program 
the financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign 
these fees were million for at 
table of contents december   we had on hand million of precious metals  measured at fair value  owned by participants in our precious metals program 
we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
the consignment agreements involve short term commitments that typically mature within to days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis 
as a result  the company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity 
beginning in february  several participants in our precious metals program renewed their requirement for us to deliver cash collateral to secure our obligations arising under the consignment agreements 
at december   ferro had delivered million in cash collateral to induce those financial institutions to continue participating in ferro s precious metals program 
as participants in our precious metals program require cash collateral to secure our obligations  ferro may choose to provide such collateral or purchase the precious metal outright as an alternative to continuing the consignment arrangements 
this requires us to borrow under our revolving credit facility or raise funds from other financing sources 
such borrowings reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 
ferro is pursuing a variety of initiatives intended to reduce the amount of precious metals required to support our manufacturing operations and reduce our dependence on consignment agreements 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs  foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangement we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  the unused portions of these lines provided million of additional liquidity at december  liquidity requirement our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  labor costs  working capital requirements  restructuring expenditures  capital investments  precious metals cash collateral requirements  and postretirement obligations 
we expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under replacement credit facilities or other financing arrangements 
cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs 
in  net decreases in our borrowings under existing credit facilities  requirements for deposits from participants in our precious metals program  and capital expenditures were funded by our equity offering and reductions in certain working capital items  particularly inventory 
we have already provided collateral for substantially all precious metals under consignment  however the value of the consigned materials and our required collateral will vary with the price of the metals and the quantity of metals used in our manufacturing operations  which may result in a further use of our liquidity resources 
to enhance liquidity  we have taken actions that include staffing reductions  control of discretionary spending  and reduced capital spending 
in the near term  should we need cash for operating activities  we would use availability under existing credit facilities and further adjust our operations to conserve cash through restructuring activities that lower manufacturing costs  reduce staffing  lower discretionary spending  and lower capital spending 
these actions could impact our operating flexibility and ability to achieve operating objectives 
our level of debt  debt service requirements  and ability to access credit markets could have important consequences to our business operations and uses of cash flows 
the credit shortage in the global capital markets has not prohibited us from accessing the capital markets  but it has increased our cost of borrowing 
we issued the convertible senior notes in the third quarter of  amended our revolving credit and term loan facility in the first and fourth quarters of  replaced our expiring asset securitization facility in the second quarter of  and sold million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of in addition  financial market 
table of contents conditions and access to credit has improved over the last several quarters  evidenced by the number of financing transactions consummated in the credit markets and the pricing of these offerings 
recent difficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit  receivable sales programs  forward contracts  and precious metal lease programs 
these counterparties are major  reputable  multinational institutions  all having investment grade credit ratings except for one  which is not rated 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counterparty default 
however  an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition 
we assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses  as well as our financial and capital structure  to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives 
as part of this process  from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and  where appropriate  pursue the sale of such businesses 
we also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position 
we generally announce publicly divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into definitive agreements relating to those transactions 
the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands loans payable to banks asset securitization program convertible notes revolving credit facility term loan facility other long term notes obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases purchase commitments obligations for interest costs  income taxes  and contributions to our post employment benefit plans are not included in the table above  but are discussed below 
cash required for interest costs in was million 
we expect cash interest in to be significantly lower due to the significant reduction in november in our overall debt levels as a result of our common stock offering  as well as anticipated lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility as a result of lower leverage ratios 
we pay taxes as part of our normal operations as a profitable company 
the amount of taxes we pay depends on a variety of factors described in more detail in critical accounting policies below 
however  the principal factors are the level of our profitability and the countries in which we earn our taxable income 
we have paid and expect to continue to pay taxes for the foreseeable future 
under the financial accounting standards board s fasb fasb accounting standards codification tm asc topic  income taxes  we anticipate that between and million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits may be reversed within the next months 
these liabilities relate to non us tax issues and are expected to reverse due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations periods 
related to the unrecognized tax benefits  the company recognized million of benefit in  million of benefit in  and million of expense in for interest  net of tax  and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid or reversed in years beyond settlement of these liabilities could require the utilization of working capital 
we expect to contribute approximately million in and million in to our pension plans  retiree medical plan and deferred contribution retirement plans 
we have not projected contributions past due to the current economic uncertainty and volatility in the global capital markets 
we determined these funding 
table of contents amounts based on the minimum contributions required under various applicable regulations in each respective country 
the pension protection act of was enacted in august while this act has had some effect on specific plan provisions in our us retirement programs  its primary effect has been to change the minimum funding requirements 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation  and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating 
table of contents losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate taxable income where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 
we earn a significant portion of our pre tax income outside the us many of these us tax jurisdictions have statutory income tax rates that are lower than that in the us because we carry a majority of our debt in the us  we also have significant cash needs in the us to service this debt 
as a result  it is necessary for us to perform significant tax and treasury planning and analysis to determine the best actions to achieve the goals of meeting our us cash needs  while also reducing our worldwide taxable income 
in this tax and treasury planning  we consider future taxable income in the us and non us jurisdictions  future cash needs in the non us  and the timing and amount of dividend repatriations 
our ability to balance future taxable income and cash flows between the us and foreign locations depends on various strategies  such as the charging of management fees for intercompany services  transfer pricing  intercompany royalties  intercompany sales of technologies and intellectual property  and choosing between allowable tax methods 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
codified primarily in asc topic  income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  codified in asc topic 
fin no 
provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more likely than not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s or s p  but exclude certain bonds  such as callable bonds  bonds with small amounts outstanding  and bonds with unusually high or low yields 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 

table of contents the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
for the market related value of plan assets  we use fair value  rather than a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
our target asset allocation percentages are fixed income and equity investments for us plans and fixed income  equity  and other investments for non us plans 
in  our pension plan assets incurred gains of within us plans and within non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease basis point decrease in asset return in discount rate assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans we base the expected return on plan assets at the beginning of the year on the weighted average expected return for the target asset allocations of the major asset classes held by each plan 
in determining the expected return  the company considers both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions 
our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans increased million to million in from million in in  our amortization of net actuarial unrecognized losses increased by million 
these unrecognized losses arise from differences between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognized in future periods 
in addition  our expected return on plan assets decreased by million due to lower asset balances largely resulting from market losses in these 
table of contents unfavorable effects were partially offset by several factors 
service costs declined by million primarily as a result of various restructuring activities  including the closing of our rotterdam  netherlands  porcelain enamel manufacturing facility in net curtailment gains increased by million 
in  we recorded a curtailment gain of million related to terminations in france and mexico  and a settlement gain of million related to lump sum payouts in italy 
also  interest costs decreased by million due to lower total benefit obligations resulting from higher discount rates and actuarial gains in for  we expect our overall net periodic benefit cost to decrease to approximately million  a decrease of million 
the substantial improvement through december in the valuation of investments in the global capital markets increased the amount of our expected return on plan assets for in addition  our unrecognized net actuarial losses  which must be amortized in future periods  declined in by million due to amortization and actuarial gains 
at december   our unrecognized net actuarial losses totaled million  with an estimated million to be recognized in restructuring and cost reduction programs between and  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america  europe and asia pacific 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives  as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made or actions are completed 
in total  we recorded million  million  and million of pre tax restructuring charges in  and  respectively 
these charges included both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimated accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyzed the carrying value of long lived assets and recorded estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or recorded an asset impairment 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  for example  a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report gross revenues with a separate display of cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions we enter into and take title and the risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory we process  although the timing of when we take title to the inventory during the production process may vary 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other non amortizing intangibles while goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded on our balance sheet are no longer amortized  we review these assets for impairment each year using a measurement date of october st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit associated with these assets using the weighted average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate a more representative fair value 
the income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting unit over its useful life and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting unit in the process 
we use historical results and trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of similar businesses  including offers from potential acquirers 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
the significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analysis of goodwill were as follows significant assumptions weighted average cost of capital residual growth rate our estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our business units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in previous levels of capital spending could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the value of one or more of our business units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
we had three reporting units with goodwill balances as of our most recent measurement date 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from to at the measurement date 
there were no known material uncertainties that would have led to an indicator of impairment for while no impairment was indicated as a result of our annual test for any reporting unit that had a goodwill balance  a future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results should differ materially from forecasted results 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and as a result not support the carrying values of our assets are new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process reducing operating margins  new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment  and substantial downturns in economic conditions such as those experienced in late and for most of assessment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  and amortizing intangible assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment and amortize amortizable intangible assets on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we continually assess long lived assets for the appropriateness of their estimated useful lives 
when circumstances indicate that there has been a reduction in the economic useful life of an asset or an asset group  we revise our estimates 
we also review property  plant and equipment and intangibles for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use and eventual disposition are less than the asset group s recorded value 
in the event of impairment  we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value of the asset group over its fair value 
the long term nature of these assets requires that we estimate cash inflows and outflows for several years into the future and only take into consideration technological advances known at the time of impairment 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex  and observable market based inputs are available to measure their fair value 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major  reputable  multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
except as noted below  we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
we hedge a portion of this exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps are settled quarterly in cash  and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense 
we mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income 
in  the fair value of the interest rate swaps was based on settlement prices provided by the counterparties 
beginning in  in connection with the adoption of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  which is codified primarily in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  the fair value of the swaps is based on the present value of expected future cash flows  which reflects assumptions about current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the company that market participants would use in pricing the swaps 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
we also manage a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities using swap arrangements that allow us to fix the price of the commodities for future purchases 
these swap arrangements are settled in cash at their maturities 
we mark these contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income 
after the contracts mature and the materials are sold  the gains and losses are recognized as a part of cost of sales 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials products 
we also use precious metals in our color and glass performance materials products 
when we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer s request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content 
prior to  most precious metal contracts were marked to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and the resulting gains or losses were recognized as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
beginning in  most precious metal contracts were designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
we also purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
our objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the pricing of the commodities for future purchases 
we also enter into forward purchase arrangements with precious metals suppliers to completely cover the value of the precious metals content of fixed price sales contracts 
most of these agreements are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas and electricity requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of these costs 
these energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december
