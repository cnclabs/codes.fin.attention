our solutions integrate with existing operations and enterprise software systems of our customers and provide financial improvement with minimal upfront costs or capital expenditures 
our operations and customers are primarily located throughout the united states and to a lesser extent  canada 
medassets delivered strong financial performance in our full year results included total consolidated net revenue of million  a increase over  net income almost doubled to reach million  or earnings of per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of million  up over last year 
these results were primarily driven by growth in our comprehensive revenue cycle services capabilities as well as increased demand for our reimbursement technology tools 
in particular  we saw strength in our charge capture audit  claims management and contract management tools 
although our core gpo volume grew in the low single digits during the year  we continued to experience significant growth in our supply chain consulting business 
during  we launched a number of product and service capabilities 
in our spend management segment  we upgraded our strategic information si analytics tool  and introduced service line analytics to help our customers identify and drive sustainable financial improvement in the management of high cost medical devices  supplies  pharmaceuticals  and other ancillary cost drivers 
we also expanded and improved our suite of solutions in the revenue cycle management segment  such as the addition and integration of capabilities from our accuro acquisition as well as the development and launch of our rac recovery audit contractor solution set 
despite the challenges of the economic environment over the last to months  we finished the year with solid business momentum heading into we are confident that our business model and solution sets will continue to provide our customer base the requisite direction  support and increased cash flow that they need in the near term and the long term as the economic effects from continues to impact their provision of care 
management s primary metrics to measure the consolidated financial performance of the business are net revenue  non gaap gross fees  non gaap revenue share obligation  non gaap adjusted ebitda  non gaap adjusted ebitda margin and non gaap diluted cash eps 

table of contents for the fiscal years ended december   and  our primary results of operations included the following fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  change change amount amount amount amount amount amount in millions in millions gross fees revenue share obligation total net revenue operating income net income adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin diluted cash eps nm nm nm these are non gaap measures 
see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
the comparison of non gaap adjusted diluted eps and non gaap diluted cash eps to performance is not meaningful due to the significant non recurring preferred stock dividends accrued or paid in prior to the company s initial public offering in december of that year 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the accuro acquisition  organic growth in our revenue cycle management segment from our reimbursement technologies  revenue cycle services and decision support software  and organic growth in our spend management segment from our technology solutions consulting services 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated operating income of million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above partially offset by the following increases in the amortization of acquired intangibles  increased share based compensation expense from our long term performance incentive plan  increased cost of revenue attributable to a higher percentage of net revenue being derived from service based engagements within our revenue cycle management and spend management segments  and higher operating expenses  exclusive of those mentioned above  relating to such items as legal expense  new employee compensation expense and bad debt expense partially mitigated by certain cost control initiatives 
for the fiscal year ending december   increases in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above  as well as lower expense growth due to certain management cost control initiatives and lower cash based incentive compensation expense during the year 
in addition  we had a reduction in certain discretionary expenses within our operating infrastructure such as advertising and marketing costs as well as a higher percentage of our product development being capitalized during the year 
this increase in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin was 
table of contents offset primarily by increased cost of revenue from segment revenue and product mix including a shift to more service based revenue and increased corporate operating expenses 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the accuro acquisition  and strong performance by our spend management segment primarily due to higher purchasing volumes by existing customers under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors in addition to an increase in contingent revenue with respect to meeting certain performance targets during the fiscal year 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we generated operating income of million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above partially offset by the following increases in the amortization of acquired intangibles  non recurring charges incurred during the fiscal year ended december   including million in intangible asset impairment charges  primarily related to the accuro acquisition  and a million interest rate swap cancellation charge  expenses related to acquisition integration efforts at our revenue cycle management segment  and higher general and administrative costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
for the fiscal year ending december   increases in non gaap adjusted ebitda compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the following a million increase in non gaap adjusted ebitda from our revenue cycle management segment and a million increase from our spend management segment  offset by million of increased corporate expenses excluding interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and other non recurring or non cash items  and continued market acceptance of our saas based solutions and acquisition based growth at the revenue cycle management segment and growth in our administrative fee net revenue in our spend management segment 
segment structure and revenue streams we deliver our solutions through two business segments  revenue cycle management or rcm and spend management or sm 
management s primary metrics to measure segment financial performance are net revenue  non gaap gross fees and segment adjusted ebitda 
all of our revenues are from external customers and inter segment revenues have been eliminated 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements herein for discussion on segment adjusted ebitda and certain items of our segment results of operations and financial position 
revenue cycle management our revenue cycle management segment provides a comprehensive suite of saas based software services spanning the hospital revenue cycle workflow from patient admission  charge capture  case management and health information management through claims processing and accounts receivable management 
our workflow solutions  together with our data management and business intelligence tools  increase revenue capture and cash collections  reduce accounts receivable balances and improve regulatory compliance 
our revenue cycle management segment revenue is listed under the caption other service fees on our 
table of contents consolidated statements of operations and consists of the following components  which are also discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements subscription and implementation fees 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis on multi year contracts for customer access to our software as a service saas based solutions 
we also charge our customers upfront fees for implementation services 
implementation fees are earned over the subscription period or estimated customer relationship period  whichever is longer 
transaction fees 
for certain revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees that vary based on the volume of customer transactions or enrolled members 
licensed software fees 
we earn license  implementation  maintenance and other software related service fees for our business intelligence  decision support and other software products 
we have certain revenue cycle management contracts that are sold in multiple element arrangements and include software products 
we have considered rule of regulation s x for these types of multiple element arrangements that include software products and determined the amount is below the threshold that would require separate disclosure on our statement of operations 
service fees 
for certain revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees based on a percentage of cash remittances collected  fixed fee and cost plus consulting arrangements 
the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
spend management our spend management segment provides a suite of technology enabled services that help our customers manage their non labor expense categories 
our solutions lower supply and medical device pricing and supply utilization by managing the procurement process through our group purchasing organization s portfolio of contracts  our consulting services and analytical tool sets 
our spend management segment revenue consists of the following components administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
we earn administrative fees from manufacturers  distributors and other vendors of products and services with whom we have contracts under which our group purchasing organization customers may purchase products and services 
administrative fees represent a percentage  which we refer to as our administrative fee ratio  typically ranging from to of the purchases made by our group purchasing organization customers through contracts with our vendors 
our group purchasing organization customers make purchases  and receive shipments  directly from the vendors 
generally on a monthly or quarterly basis  vendors provide us with a report describing the purchases made by our customers through our group purchasing organization vendor contracts  including associated administrative fees 
we recognize revenue upon the receipt of these reports from vendors 
some customer contracts require that a portion of our administrative fees are contingent upon achieving certain financial improvements  such as lower supply costs  which we refer to as performance targets 
contingent administrative fees are not recognized as revenue until the customer confirms achievement of those contractual performance targets 
prior to customer confirmation that a performance target has been achieved  we record contingent administrative fees as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
often  recognition of this revenue occurs in periods subsequent to the recognition of the associated costs 
should we fail to meet a performance target  we may be contractually obligated to refund some or all of the contingent fees 
additionally  in many cases  we are contractually obligated to pay a portion of the administrative fees to our hospital and health system customers 
typically this amount  which we refer to as our revenue share obligation  is calculated as a percentage of administrative fees earned on a particular customer s purchases from our vendors 
our total net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations is shown net of the revenue share obligation 

table of contents other service fees 
the following items are included as other service fees in our consolidated statement of operations consulting fees 
we consult with our customers regarding the costs and utilization of medical devices and implantable physician preference items  or ppi  and the efficiency and quality of their key clinical service lines 
our consulting projects are typically fixed fee projects with an average duration of six to nine months  and the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
subscription fees 
we also offer technology enabled services that provide spend management analytics and data services to improve operational efficiency  reduce supply costs  and increase transparency across spend management processes 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly basis for these company hosted saas based solutions 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct labor costs incurred to generate our revenue 
direct labor costs consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and other direct costs and share based compensation expenses related to personnel who provide services to implement our solutions for our customers 
as the majority of our services are generated internally  our costs to provide these services are primarily labor driven 
a less significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of costs of third party products and services and client reimbursed out of pocket costs 
cost of revenue does not include allocated amounts for rent  depreciation or amortization because we do not consider the inclusion of these items in cost of revenue relevant to our business 
however  cost of revenue does include the amortization for the cost of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of the accuro acquisition and related integration  there may be some re allocation of expenses primarily between cost of revenue and general and administrative expense resulting from the implementation of our accounting expense allocation policies that could affect period over period comparability 
in addition  any changes in revenue mix between our revenue cycle management and spend management segments  specifically related to service type arrangements  may cause significant fluctuations in our cost of revenue and have a favorable or unfavorable impact on operating income 
product development expenses 
product development expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  and share based compensation expense of the technology professionals who develop  support and maintain our software related products and services 
product development expenses are net of capitalized software development costs 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing programs including trade shows and brand messaging  personnel related expenses for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense  certain meeting costs and travel related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense and travel related expenses  occupancy and other indirect costs  insurance costs  professional fees  and other general overhead expenses 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of software  including capitalized costs of software developed for internal use 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets with the exception of software  primarily resulting from acquisitions 
key considerations certain significant items or events must be considered to better understand differences in our results of operations from period to period 
we believe that the following items or events have had a material impact on 
table of contents our results of operations for the periods discussed below or may have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods long term performance incentive plan on january   the compensation committee of our board granted equity awards totaling million underlying shares to certain employees at a fair value of per share  of which approximately of the total grant was allocated to the company s named executive officers or neos  under the company s long term performance incentive plan 
our stock based compensation expense increased significantly in and is expected to be higher in future periods as compared to prior periods as a result of the issuance of equity awards under the long term performance incentive plan 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
cash based incentive compensation historically  we have fully funded our discretionary bonus and incentive pool 
during  we did not fund a significant majority of our discretionary bonus and incentive pool 
this decrease in compensation expense provided for a favorable impact on our operating expenses  net income and adjusted ebitda for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal years ended december  and revenue cycle management acquisitions the results of operations of acquired businesses the revenue cycle management acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
since january   material acquisitions include for details regarding these acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements accuro  acquired on june   provides saas based revenue cycle management products and services to a broad range of healthcare providers 
md x  acquired on july   provides revenue cycle products and services for hospitals and health systems 
xactimed  acquired on may   provides saas based revenue cycle products and services that focus on claims management  remittance management  and denial management 
purchase accounting deferred revenue and cost adjustment 
upon acquiring accuro and xactimed  we made certain purchase accounting adjustments to reduce the acquired deferred revenue and deferred cost to the fair value of outstanding services and products to be provided post acquisition 
on june   we reduced the acquired deferred revenue and deferred cost from accuro by million and million  respectively 
on may   we reduced the acquired deferred revenue from xactimed by million 
these changes only impacted our revenue cycle management segment 
in process research and development  or ipr d 
upon acquiring xactimed  we made certain purchase accounting adjustments to write off acquired ipr d 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred charges of million related to the xactimed acquisition to impair the value of acquired intangibles associated with software development costs for products that were not yet available for general release and had no alternative future use at the time of acquisition 
the charge only impacted our revenue cycle management segment 
credit facility amendment in may  in connection with the completion of the accuro acquisition  we entered into the third amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the amendment increased our term loan facility by million and the commitments to loan amounts under our revolving credit facility from million to million 

table of contents the amendment also increased the applicable margins on the rate of interest we pay under our credit agreement 
upon closing this amendment  we received million of proceeds less debt issuance costs under our increased term loan facility  and we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the million in increased borrowings and existing cash on hand were used to fund the cash portion of the accuro acquisition purchase price 
termination of interest rate swaps in june  we terminated two floating to fixed rate libor based interest rate swaps that were originally set to terminate july in consideration of the early terminations  we paid to the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the swaps are no longer recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  impairment of assets during  certain of our assets were deemed to be impaired as they no longer provided future economic benefit 
such assets primarily included certain acquired trade names  developed technology  and internally developed software 
hence  we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling million during the fiscal year ended december  initial public offering on december   we closed on our initial public offering of common stock 
as a result of the offering  we issued  shares of common stock for proceeds of million net of underwriting fees of million and other offering costs of million

total net revenue 
total net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in total net revenue was comprised of a million increase in revenue cycle management revenue and a million increase in spend management revenue 
revenue cycle management revenue 
revenue cycle management revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following accuro related revenue 
the operating results of accuro were included in our full fiscal year ended december  and were only included in the comparable prior period for approximately seven months from the date of the accuro acquisition on june  in  million of the net revenue increase was attributable to the accuro acquisition 
given the significant impact of the accuro acquisition on our revenue cycle management segment  we believe acquisition affected measures are useful for the comparison of our year over year net revenue growth

spend management net revenue 
spend management net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the net revenue increase was the result of a net increase in gross administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in revenue share obligation  and an increase in other service fees of million 
gross administrative fees 
non gaap gross administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  primarily due to slightly higher purchasing volumes by new and existing customers under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors 
this net increase in non gaap gross administrative fee revenue was comprised of a million  or increase  in non gaap gross administrative fee revenue not associated with performance targets 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in contingent revenue  which is recognized upon confirmation from certain customers that respective performance targets had been achieved  during the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  we may have fluctuations in our non gaap gross administrative fee revenue in future periods as the timing of vendor reporting and customer acknowledgement of achieved performance targets vary in their timing and may not result in discernable trends 
in addition  a decrease in customer patient volume and supply utilization  the effect of continued hospital budget challenges and the lingering effect of the weakened economy may negatively impact non gaap gross administrative fees in the future 
revenue share obligation 
non gaap revenue share obligation increased million  or  as compared to the prior period 
we analyze the impact of our non gaap revenue share obligation on our results of operations by calculating the ratio of non gaap revenue share obligation to non gaap gross administrative fees or the revenue share ratio 
our revenue share ratio was and for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
we have not had any significant changes in our customer revenue mix during the year that would cause a notable impact on our revenue share ratio 
we may experience fluctuations in our revenue share ratio because of the timing of vendor reporting and the timing of revenue recognition based on performance target achievement for certain customers 
other service fees 
the million  or  increase in other service fees primarily related to million in higher revenues from medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services partially offset by a million decrease in our market research services 
the growth in supply chain consulting was mainly due to an increased number of engagements from new and existing customers

the remaining million increase was attributable to the direct costs resulting from the continuing shift in our revenue mix towards our rcm segment  which contributed and of consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
specifically  the increase in saas based revenue and other consulting services within the rcm segment resulted in a higher associated cost of revenue than does gpo activities in our sm segment 
in addition  we had an increase in service related engagements in both our rcm and sm segments  which provides for a higher cost of revenue given these activities are more labor intensive

the decrease in interest income during the fiscal year ended december  compared to the prior year was attributable to the change in our cash management policy that occurred in the third quarter of which significantly reduced our cash balance 
other expense for the fiscal year ended december  was million  comprised principally of a million expense to terminate our interest rate swap arrangements  partially offset by approximately million in interest income and million in rental income 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million from an income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended december   which was primarily attributable to i increased income before taxes resulting in higher federal income tax expense of million  and  ii additional foreign and state income taxes totaling million 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in income tax expense related to research and development credits recorded during the year 
the income tax expense recorded during the fiscal year ended december  and reflected an annual effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to research and development tax credits 
as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded against the deferred tax assets on certain state net operating loss carryforwards because apportioned taxable income to certain states may not be sufficient for these loss carryforwards to be utilized 
in addition  certain restrictions within section of the internal revenue code will limit the usage of certain state net operating losses and may make the utilization of these net operating losses uncertain 
we will analyze our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards periodically to ensure our valuation allowance is accurately stated

partially offsetting the increase in our software related subscription fees was an approximate million decrease in revenue from our decision support software and services 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a million revenue loss due to a scheduled and planned step down in software support and maintenance fees from a large decision support customer

spend management net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the revenue increase was primarily the result of an increase in administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in revenue share obligations  and an increase in other service fees of million 
gross administrative fees 
non gaap gross administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  primarily due to higher purchasing volumes by existing customers under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors which totaled million

spend management expenses 
spend management expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the growth in spend management expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expense to new and existing consulting and support staff  contributing million of the overall increase 
we also incurred higher share based compensation expense to new and existing employees of million compared to the prior period 
partially offsetting these expense increases was a million decrease in the amortization of identified intangible assets as certain of these assets are amortized under an accelerated method and are nearing the end of their useful life 

table of contents as a percentage of spend management segment net revenue  segment expenses decreased from during the fiscal year ended december  to during the fiscal year ended december   primarily because of a decline in the amortization of identified intangibles 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december   or and of total net revenue  respectively

critical accounting policy disclosure the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we find reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions 
management believes that the following accounting judgments and uncertainties are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when a there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the fee is fixed or determinable  c services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
inclusive in our revenue recognition policies  we are required to make certain critical judgments that impact the period over which revenue is recognized 
these judgments are described below 
subscription and implementation fees we apply the revenue recognition guidance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or us gaap relating to software for our hosted solutions 
we provide subscription based revenue cycle and spend management services through software tools accessed by our customers while the data is hosted and maintained on our servers 
in many arrangements  customers are charged set up fees for implementation and monthly subscription fees for access to these web based hosted services 
implementation fees are typically billed at the beginning of the arrangement and recognized as revenue over the greater of the subscription period or the estimated customer relationship period 
we estimate the customer relationship period based on historical customer retention rates 
we currently estimate our customer relationship period to be between four and five years for our hosted services 
revenue from monthly hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the customer uses the service 
contract subscription periods typically range from three to five years from execution 
we consistently monitor our customer relationship periods and as a result  our estimated customer relationship period may change due to the changing attrition rates of our customers 
we have historically changed our estimates of customer relationship periods for certain of our web hosted customers 
these changes in estimated customer lives have typically deferred revenue over longer periods 
licensed software fees we license certain revenue cycle decision support software products 
software revenues are derived from three primary sources i software licenses  ii software support  and iii services  which include consulting  product services and training programs 
we recognize revenue for our software arrangements based on generally accepted accounting principles relating to software 
we evaluate vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in certain of our multi element software arrangements we are unable to establish vsoe for certain of our deliverables 
the majority of our software licenses are for a term of one year which results in undeterminable vsoe 
in arrangements where vsoe cannot be determined for the separate elements of the arrangement  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are expected to be performed or over the software support period  whichever is longer  beginning with the delivery and acceptance of the software  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
as a result  we are required to make assumptions regarding the implementation period of each particular arrangement in order to determine the appropriate period to recognize revenue 
we evaluate the expected implementation period in which services are expected to be performed based on historical trends and current customer specific criteria 
our actual implementation periods may differ from our estimates 
in the event we have to adjust our estimate  we would record a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is changed 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers the following to be important factors that could trigger an impairment review and may result in an impairment charge significant and sustained underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  significant 
table of contents and sustained adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant negative changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles relating to goodwill and other intangibles 
this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires us to make market participant assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability and growth of future business strategies to determine estimated future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we measure the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit or asset group using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  capital expenditures and cost of capital  similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of a reporting unit or asset group  and therefore can affect the amount of the impairment 
the following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections business projections 
we make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume  mix  and pricing 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors 
long term growth rate 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to the present value of the debt free cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 
discount rate 
when measuring possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 
weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk adjusted after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
economic projections 
assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry sales volumes and interest rates 
our estimates of future cash flow used in these valuations could differ from actual results 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
based on our sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical decrease applied to our assumed growth rates or a hypothetical increase applied to our weighted average cost of capital applied to our discounted cash flow analysis would not result in an impairment of our intangible assets nor would it cause us to further evaluate goodwill for impairment 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we adopted revised generally accepted accounting principles relating to business combinations as of january  the revised guidance retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and requires a number of changes to the previous guidance  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
other changes include requiring the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requiring the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requiring the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
our purchase price allocation methodology requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities 
table of contents based upon appraised market values  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
management determines the fair value of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology or customer relationships  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies  and result in an impairment or a new allocation of purchase price 
given our history of acquisitions  we may allocate part of the purchase price of future acquisitions to contingent consideration as required by generally accepted accounting principles for business combinations 
the fair value calculation of contingent consideration will involve a number of assumptions that are subjective in nature and which may differ significantly from actual results 
we may experience volatility in our earnings to some degree in future reporting periods as a result of these fair value measurements 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as whether a customer declares bankruptcy 
other factors include the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may experience a higher or lower expense 
our bad debt expense to total net revenue ratio for the fiscal years ended december  and was and or and of other service fee revenue  respectively 
the increase was attributable to approximately million for potential uncollectible accounts which includes certain bankruptcies that occurred during the fiscal year with respect to customers in our revenue cycle management segment 
in addition  as more revenues are being generated from certain saas based solutions and consulting services within our revenue cycle management segment  we may continue to experience a higher bad debt expense to total revenue ratio percentage 
given the lingering effect of the weakened economy and customer financial constraints  we may experience additional collectibility challenges that affect our ability to collect customer payments in future periods 
this could require additional charges to bad debt expense 
a hypothetical increase in bad debt expense would result in approximately million and million of additional bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  as needed  based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
our tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the forecasted amount and timing of future taxable income 
we estimate the company s effective tax rate based upon the known rates and estimated state tax apportionment 
this rate is determined based upon location of company personnel  location of company assets and determination of sales on a jurisdictional basis 
we currently file returns in approximately jurisdictions 

table of contents we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity when realized 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
if tax law does not specify the ordering in a particular circumstance  then a pro rata approach is used 
effective january   we adopted generally accepted accounting principles relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
upon adoption of this guidance  our policy is to include interest and penalties in our provision for income taxes 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and certain state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
each quarter we assess our uncertain tax positions and adjust our reserve accordingly based on the most recent facts and circumstances 
if there is a significant change in the underlying facts and circumstances or applicable tax law modifications  we may be exposed to additional benefits or expense 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for the impact of uncertain tax positions in we expect a significant increase in our cash taxes in future years  primarily attributable to exhausting the majority of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan  which includes non qualified stock options  non vested share awards and stock settled stock appreciation rights 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  note  stockholders equity and note  share based compensation  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
prior to our initial public offering  valuing our share price as a privately held company was complex 
we used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with us gaap for privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  in assessing and determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
the fair value of our common stock was determined through periodic valuations 
our stock valuations used a combination of the market comparable approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value of our company at each valuation date 
there was a high degree of subjectivity involved in using option pricing models and there was no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates resulting from these valuation models  nor was there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
for grants following the initial public offering  we utilized market based share prices of our common stock in the black scholes option pricing model to calculate fair value of our common stock option awards 
this valuation technique will continue to involve highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and estimated forfeitures 
it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  required by existing accounting requirements  given our limited history as a publicly traded company 
once we have sufficient history as a public company  we will calculate the expected volatility of our share price based on our trading history  which may impact our future share based compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for stock compensation  we have estimated grant date fair value of our shares using 
table of contents volatility calculated calculated volatility from an appropriate industry sector index of comparable entities 
we identified similar public entities for which share and option price information was available  and considered the historical volatilities of those entities share prices in calculating volatility 
dividend payments were not assumed  as we did not anticipate paying a dividend at the dates in which the various option grants occurred during the year 
the risk free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for zero coupon treasury bonds over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of the awards represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
based on our limited history  we utilized the simplified method as prescribed in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate expected term 
for service based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using an accelerated method over the vesting or service period and is net of estimated forfeitures 
for performance based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using a straight line method over the vesting or performance period and is adjusted each reporting period in which a change in performance achievement is determined and is net of estimated forfeitures 
self insurance reserves beginning january   we established a company wide self insurance plan for employee healthcare and dental insurance 
we accrue self insurance reserves based upon estimates of the aggregate liability of claim costs which are probable and estimable 
we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure on certain catastrophic claims 
our current insurance policy contains a stop loss amount of million per individual and a maximum aggregated stop loss limit of million per policy year on certain catastrophic claims 
reserves for claim costs are estimated using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and our historical experience 
self insurance reserves are based on management s estimates of the costs to settle employee insurance claims 
as such  differences between actual costs and management s estimates could be significant 
additionally  changes in actuarial assumptions used in the development of these reserves could affect net income in a given period 
changes in the nature of claims or the number of employees could also impact our estimate 
our current estimated aggregate maximum payment exposure under the insurance plan  for the current plan year  is approximately and million as of december  and  respectively 
based on the trend of rising healthcare costs  we may experience higher employee healthcare expense in future periods 
a hypothetical change in our self insured liabilities as of december  would have affected net earnings by approximately million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements involve payment of ordinary expenses  working capital fluctuations  debt service obligations and capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures typically consist of software purchases  internal product development capitalization and computer hardware purchases 
historically  the acquisition of complementary businesses has resulted in a significant use of cash 
our principal sources of funds have primarily been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we believe we currently have adequate cash flow from operations  capital resources and liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements including the following near term obligations i our working capital needs  ii our debt service obligations including a required excess cash payment to our lenders  iii planned capital expenditures for the remainder of the year  iv our revenue share obligation and rebate payments  and v estimated federal and state income tax payments 
historically  we have utilized federal net operating loss carryforwards nols for both regular and alternative minimum tax payment purposes 
consequently  our federal cash tax payments in past reporting periods have been minimal 
however  given the current amount and limitations of our nols  we expect our cash paid for taxes to increase significantly in future years 
we have not historically utilized borrowings available under our credit agreement to fund operations 
however  pursuant to the change in our cash management practice in  we currently use the swing line 
table of contents component of our revolver for funding operations while we voluntarily apply our excess cash balances to reduce our swing line loan on a daily basis and to reduce our revolving credit facility on a routine basis 
as of december   we had zero dollars drawn on our revolving credit facility resulting in million of availability under our revolving credit facility inclusive of the swing line netted for a million letter of credit 
based on our analysis as of december   we are in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements of our credit agreement 
we may observe fluctuations in cash flows provided by operations from period to period 
certain events may cause us to draw additional amounts under our swing line or revolving facility and may include the following changes in working capital due to inconsistent timing of cash receipts and payments for major recurring items such as trade accounts payable  revenue share obligation  incentive compensation  changes in deferred revenue  and other various items  acquisitions  and unforeseeable events or transactions 
we may continue to pursue other acquisitions or investments in the future 
we may also increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure  software solutions  and personnel  and as we expand our market presence 
cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund such expenditures 
accordingly  in addition to the use of our available revolving credit facility  we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds for such purposes 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters including higher interest costs  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be limited 
discussion of cash flow as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively

these non cash expenses include depreciation for fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  stock compensation expense  bad debt expense  deferred income tax expense  excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  loss on sale of assets  impairment of intangibles and non cash interest expense 
the total for these non cash expenses was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents working capital is a measure of our liquid assets 
changes in working capital are included in the determination of cash provided by operating activities 
for the fiscal year ended december   working capital changes resulting in a reduction to cash flow from operations of million were an increase in accounts receivable of million related to the timing of invoicing and cash collections and our revenue growth  an increase in other long term assets of million related to the timing of cash payments for our deferred sales expenses  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million primarily related to sales incentive compensation payments  a decrease in accrued payroll and benefits of million due to payroll cycle timing and cash incentive compensation accruals  and a decrease in other accrued expenses of million due to the timing of various payment obligations

we also received million from the issuance of common stock and million from the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
this was offset by payments made on our credit facility of million inclusive of the million excess cash flow payment in addition to payments of million that were made on our finance obligation 
our credit agreement requires an annual payment of excess cash flow which amounted to million for the fiscal year ended december  we have adequate liquidity to fund this payment and expect to pay it in the first quarter of financing activities provided million of cash for the fiscal year ended december  we borrowed million on our credit facility during the period

credit agreement we are party to a credit agreement  with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  bnp paribas  as syndication agent  cit healthcare llc  as documentation agent  and the other lenders party thereto  or the lenders  as amended 
the agreement provides for a i term loan facility and ii a revolving loan facility with a million aggregate loan commitment amount available  including a million sub facility for letters of credit and a million swing line facility 
we utilize the revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  equal to the eurodollar rate for a eurodollar rate loan as defined in the credit agreement  or the base rate for a base rate loan as defined in the credit agreement  plus an applicable margin 
under the revolving loan facility we also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving loan facility ranging from to based on the same consolidated leverage ratio and a quarterly fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans on the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit

table of contents the term loan facility matures on october  and the revolving loan facility matures on october  we are required to make quarterly principal amortization payments of approximately million on the term loan facility 
such required quarterly principal payments were reduced from million after partially prepaying our term loan using proceeds from our initial public offering 
no principal payments are due on the revolving loan facility until the revolving facility maturity date 
we are also required to prepay our debt obligations based on an excess cash flow calculation for the applicable fiscal year which is determined in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement 
in may  we entered into the third amendment to our existing credit agreement in connection with the completion of the accuro acquisition 
the third amendment increased our term loan facility by million and the commitments to loan amounts under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
the third amendment also increased the applicable margins on the rate of interest we pay under our credit agreement 
as set forth above  the additional debt is subject to certain financial covenants of the original credit agreement 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  there are no provisions in the credit agreement that require us to maintain a lock box arrangement 
the third amendment became effective upon the closing of the accuro acquisition on june  we utilized cash on hand and approximately million of the increased borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of accuro 
in july  we entered into the fourth amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the fourth amendment increased the swing line loan sublimit from million to million 
the balance outstanding under our swing line loan is a component of the revolving credit commitments 
the total commitments under the credit facility  including the aggregate revolving credit commitments  were not increased as a result of the fourth amendment 
during september  we voluntarily changed our cash management practice to reduce our interest expense by instituting an auto borrowing plan with the agent under our credit agreement 
as a result  all of our excess cash on hand is voluntarily used to repay our swing line credit facility on a daily basis and we now fund our cash expenditures by using swing line loans 
as of december   we had a zero balance on our swing line loan and million was available under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to million of outstanding but undrawn letters of credit on such date 
we also had million outstanding of bank debt and a cash balance of million as of december  our credit agreement contains financial and other restrictive covenants  ratios and tests that limit our ability to incur additional debt and engage in other activities 
for example  our credit agreement includes covenants restricting  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  engage in certain lines of business  engage in mergers or consolidations  dispose of assets  make investments or acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into negative pledges or pay dividends or make other restricted payments 
our credit agreement also includes financial covenants including requirements that we maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of to and a minimum consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio of to as of december  the consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio thresholds adjust in future periods 
the following table shows our future covenant thresholds covenant requirements table maximum consolidated minimum total debt consolidated to adjusted fixed ebitda charge leverage coverage period ratio ratio october  through september  october  through september  thereafter 
table of contents the components that comprise the calculation of the aforementioned covenants are specifically defined in our credit agreement and require us to make certain adjustments to derive the amounts used in the calculation of each ratio 
based on our analysis as of december   our consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio  calculated in accordance with the credit agreement  was approximately to and our consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio was approximately to  both of which are in compliance with the requirements of our credit agreement 
refer to the table in the earlier part of this section for a summary of the pricing tiers and the applicable rates 
the determination of our pricing tier is based on the consolidated leverage ratio that was calculated in the most recent compliance certificate received by our administrative agent which would have been for the nine month reporting period ended september  in addition  our loans and other obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed  subject to specified limitations  by our present and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   we were not in default of any restrictive or financial covenants or ratios under our credit agreement 
summary disclosure concerning contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have contractual obligations under our credit agreement and a capital lease finance obligation 
in addition  we maintain operating leases for certain facilities and office equipment

in july  we extended the terms of our office building lease agreement by an additional four years through july  which increased our total finance 
table of contents obligation by million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading finance obligations for additional information regarding this transaction and the related obligation 
aggregation of other purchase obligations 
effective january   we adopted generally accepted accounting principles relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the above amount relates to management s estimate of uncertain tax positions 
as a result of our nols  we have several tax periods with open statutes of limitations that will remain open until our nols are utilized 
as such  we cannot predict the precise timing that this liability will be applied or utilized 
additionally the liability may increase or decrease if management s estimate of uncertain tax positions changes when new information arises or changes in circumstances occur 
indemnification of product users 
we provide a limited indemnification to users of our products against any patent  copyright  or trade secret claims brought against them 
the duration of the indemnifications vary based upon the life of the specific individual agreements 
we have not had a material indemnification claim  and we do not believe we will have a material claim in the future 
as such  we have not recorded any liability for these indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
acquisition contingent consideration 
in august  the former owner of med data management  inc or med data disputed our earn out calculation made under the med data asset purchase agreement and alleged that we failed to fulfill our obligations with respect to the earn out 
in november  the former owner filed a complaint alleging that we failed to act in good faith with respect to the operation of med data subsequent to the acquisition which affected the earn out calculation 
the company refutes these allegations and is vigorously defending itself against these allegations 
on march  we filed an answer  denying the plaintiffs allegations and also filed a counterclaim  alleging that the plaintiffs fraudulently induced us to enter into the purchase agreement by intentionally concealing the status of their relationship with their largest customer 
discovery has been completed and briefing has been completed on medassets and plaintiffs dispositive motions  but we currently cannot estimate any probable outcome and have not recorded a loss contingency in our consolidated statement of operations 
the maximum earn out payable under the asset purchase agreement is million 
in addition  the plaintiffs claim that ms 
hodges  one of the plaintiffs  is entitled to the accelerated vesting of options to purchase  shares of our common stock that she received in connection with her employment agreement with the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a million letter of credit to guarantee our performance under the terms of a ten year lease agreement 
the letter of credit is associated with the capital lease of a building located in cape girardeau  missouri under a finance obligation 
we do not believe that this letter of credit will be drawn 
we lease office space and equipment under operating leases 
some of these operating leases include rent escalations  rent holidays  and rent concessions and incentives 
however  we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term utilizing total future minimum lease payments 
as of december   we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future significant effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board in its financial and operational decision making  we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures gross fees  gross administrative fees  revenue share obligation  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue and cash diluted earnings per share 

table of contents these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
we compensate for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
we provide reconciliations of non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures  where possible 
investors are encouraged to carefully review those reconciliations 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by us  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross fees  gross administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
gross fees include all gross administrative fees we receive pursuant to our vendor contracts and all other fees we receive from customers 
our revenue share obligation represents the portion of the gross administrative fees we are contractually obligated to share with certain of our gpo customers 
total net revenue a gaap measure reflects our gross fees net of our revenue share obligation 
these non gaap measures assist management and the board and may be helpful to investors in analyzing our growth in the spend management segment given that administrative fees constitute a material portion of our revenue and are paid to us by over  vendors contracted by our gpo  and that our revenue share obligation constitutes a significant outlay to certain of our gpo customers 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the overview and results of operations section of item ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
we define i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and other non recurring  non cash or non operating items  and iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we use ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance consistently over time as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges and amortization of debt issuance costs  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes  as well as other non cash purchase accounting adjustments  and imputed rental income and non recurring items  from our operational results 
adjusted ebitda also removes the impact of non cash share based compensation expense 
our board and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs  as well as for incentive compensation plans for employees generally 
additionally  research analysts  investment bankers and lenders may use these measures to assess our operating performance 
for example  our credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are  in part  based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and our board 
the principal difference is that the measurement of adjusted ebitda considered by our lenders under our credit agreement allows for certain adjustments eg  inclusion of interest income  franchise taxes and other non cash expenses  offset by the deduction of our capitalized lease payments for one of our office leases that result in a higher adjusted ebitda than the adjusted ebitda measure reviewed by our board and management and disclosed in our annual report on form k 
additionally  our credit agreement contains provisions that utilize other measures  such as excess cash flow  to measure liquidity 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical 
table of contents tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  we encourage you to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
we also strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in this section  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to ebitda to adjusted ebitda are either i non cash items eg  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangibles and share based compensation expense or ii items that management does not consider in assessing our on going operating performance eg  income taxes  interest expense and expenses related to the cancellation of an interest rate swap 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 

table of contents the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda for the fiscal years ended december   and fiscal year ended december  in thousands net income depreciation amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles included in cost of revenue interest expense  net of interest income income tax benefit ebitda impairment of intangibles share based compensation expense rental income from capitalizing building lease accuro xactimed purchase accounting adjustments interest rate swap cancellation adjusted ebitda interest income is included in other income expense and is not netted against interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of intangibles during the fiscal year ended december  primarily relates to acquired developed technology from prior acquisitions  revenue cycle management tradename and internally developed software products  mainly due to the integration of accuro s operations and products 
impairment of intangibles during fiscal year ended december  represents the write off of in process research and development from the xactimed acquisition in may represents non cash share based compensation to both employees and directors 
the increase in is due to share based grants made under our long term performance incentive plan 
the increase in is due to share based grants made subsequent to our initial public offering 
the significant increase in is due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we believe excluding this non cash expense allows us to compare our operating performance without regard to the impact of share based compensation expense  which varies from period to period based on the amount and timing of grants 
the imputed rental income recognized with respect to a capitalized building lease is deducted from net income loss due to its non cash nature 
we believe this income is not a useful measure of continuing operating performance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this rental income 
these adjustments include the effect on revenue of adjusting acquired deferred revenue balances  net of any reduction in associated deferred costs  to fair value as of the respective acquisition dates for accuro and xactimed 
the reduction of the deferred revenue balances materially affects period to period financial performance comparability and revenue and earnings growth in future periods subsequent to the acquisition and is not indicative of changes in underlying results of operations 
in  these adjustments will no longer be reconciling items related to acquired deferred revenue balances because the amounts were fully amortized in we may have this adjustment in future periods if we have any new acquisitions 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded an expense associated with the cancellation of our interest rate swap arrangements 
in connection with the cancellation  we paid the counterparty million in termination fees 
we believe such expense is infrequent in nature and is not indicative of continuing operating performance 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue includes the revenue of accuro prior to our actual ownership 
the accuro acquisition 
table of contents was consummated on june  this measure assumes the acquisition of accuro occurred on january  revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue is used by management and the board to better understand the extent of organic period over period growth of the revenue cycle management segment 
given the significant impact that this acquisition had on the company during the fiscal years ended december  and  we believe such acquisition affected net revenue may be useful and meaningful to investors in their analysis of such growth 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue is presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our results of operations would have been if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of such period 
this measure also should not be considered representative of our future results of operations 
reconciliations of revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue to its most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the results of operations section of item diluted cash earnings per share the company defines diluted cash eps as diluted earnings per share excluding non cash acquisition related intangible amortization  non recurring expense items on a tax adjusted basis and non cash tax adjusted shared based compensation expense 
diluted cash eps is not a measure of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and is not an alternative to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
diluted cash eps growth is used by the company as the financial performance metric that determines whether certain equity awards granted pursuant to the company s long term performance incentive plan will vest 
use of this measure for this purpose allows management and the board to analyze the company s operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non cash and non recurring items from our operations and reward organic growth and accretive business transactions 
as a significant portion of senior management s incentive based compensation is based on the achievement of certain diluted cash eps growth over time  investors may find such information useful  however  as a non gaap financial measure  diluted cash eps is not the sole measure of the company s financial performance and may not be the best measure for investors to gauge such performance 
twelve months ended december  per share data diluted eps nm pre tax non cash  acquisition related intangible amortization nm pre tax non cash  share based compensation nm pre tax interest rate swap cancellation nm pre tax non cash  impairment of intangibles nm tax effect on pre tax adjustments nm non gaap diluted cash eps nm weighted average shares diluted the comparison of non gaap adjusted diluted eps and non gaap diluted cash eps to performance is not meaningful due to the significant non recurring preferred stock dividends accrued or paid in prior to the company s initial public offering in december of that year 
represents the per share impact  on a tax adjusted basis of non cash share based compensation to both employees and directors 
the significant increase in is due to share based grants made from the long term performance incentive plan previously discussed 
we believe excluding this non cash expense allows us to compare our operating performance without regard to the impact of share based compensation expense  which varies from period to period based on the amount and timing of grants 
represents the per share impact  on a tax adjusted basis of an expense associated with the cancellation of our interest rate swap arrangement during the fiscal year ended december  in connection with the cancellation  we paid the counterparty million in termination fees 
we believe such expense is infrequent in nature and is not indicative of continuing operating performance 

table of contents represents the per share impact  on a tax adjusted basis of impairment of intangibles during the fiscal year ended december  the impairment primarily relates to acquired developed technology from prior acquisitions  revenue cycle management tradename and internally developed software products deemed impaired as a result of the accuro acquisition 
this amount reflects the tax impact to the adjustments used to derive non gaap diluted cash eps 
the company uses its effective tax rate for each respective period to tax effect the adjustments 
the effective tax rate for the three months ended december  and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december  and was and  respectively

new accounting pronouncements accounting standards codification in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb made the fasb accounting standards codification the codification the single source of us gaap used by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative accounting guidance for sec registrants 
the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into approximately accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for the company beginning july  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
as a result of adopting this standard  we will no longer reference specific standards under the pre codification naming convention and all references to accounting standards will be made in plain english as defined by the sec 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the update addressed the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
the update also addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in the update significantly expand the disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with the objective of providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the accounting standards update will be applicable for annual periods beginning after june   however  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements 
software in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update relating to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the update will change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
among other things  tangible products containing software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
certain of our contracts are denominated in canadian dollars 
as our canadian sales have not historically been significant to our operations  we do not believe that changes in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar will have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as we continue to grow our operations  we may increase the amount of our sales to foreign customers 
although we do not expect foreign currency exchange risk to have a significant impact on our future operations  we will assess the risk on a case specific basis to determine whether a forward currency hedge instrument would be warranted 
on august   we entered into a series of forward contracts to fix the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates on a canadian customer contract  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
we have one other canadian dollar contract that we have not elected to hedge 
we currently do not transact any other business in any currency other than the us dollar 
we continue to evaluate the credit worthiness of the counterparty of the hedge instruments 
considering the current state of the credit markets and specific challenges related to financial institutions  the company continues to believe that the size  international presence and us government cash infusion  and operating history of the counterparty will allow them to perform under the obligations of the contract and are not a risk of default that would change the highly effective status of the hedged instruments 
interest rate risk 
we had outstanding borrowings on our term loan and revolving credit facility of million as of december  the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
on may   we entered into a london inter bank offered rate or libor interest rate swap with a notional amount of million beginning june   which effectively converts a portion of our variable rate term loan credit facility to a fixed rate debt 
the notional amount subject to the swap has pre set 
table of contents quarterly step downs corresponding to our anticipated principal reduction schedule 
the interest rate swap converts the three month libor rate on the corresponding notional amount of debt to an effective fixed rate of exclusive of the applicable bank margin charged by our lender 
the interest rate swap terminates on march  and qualifies as a highly effective cash flow hedge under generally accepted accounting principles for derivatives and hedging 
as such  the fair value of the derivative will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the interest rate swap matures on march  as of december   the interest rate swap had a market value of million million net of tax 
the liability is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  the unrealized loss is recorded in other comprehensive loss  net of tax  in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
we entered into an interest rate collar in june which effectively sets a maximum libor interest rate of and a minimum libor interest rate of on the interest rate we pay on million of our term loan debt outstanding  effectively limiting our base interest rate exposure on this portion of our term loan debt to within that range to 
the collar does not hedge the applicable margin that the counterparty charges on our revolving credit facility and term loan see rate schedule in our discussion of cash flow section 
settlement payments are made between the hedge counterparty and us on a quarterly basis  coinciding with our term loan installment payment dates  for any rate overage on the maximum rate and any rate deficiency on the minimum rate on the notional amount outstanding 
the collar terminates on september  and no consideration was exchanged with the counterparty to enter into the hedging arrangement 
as of december   we pay an effective interest rate of on million of notional term loan debt outstanding before applying the applicable margin 
we continue to evaluate the credit worthiness of the counterparty of the hedge instruments when assessing effectiveness 
the company believes that given the size of the hedged instruments and the likelihood that the counterparty would have to perform under the contracts mitigates any potential credit risk and risk of non performance under the contract 
in addition  the company understands the interest rate hedge counterparty has been acquired by a much larger financial institution 
we believe that the creditworthiness of the acquirer mitigates risk and will allow the interest rate hedge counterparty to be able to perform under the terms of the contract 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in libor would have resulted in an approximate million change to our interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   which represents potential interest rate change exposure on our outstanding unhedged portion of our term loan and revolving credit facility
