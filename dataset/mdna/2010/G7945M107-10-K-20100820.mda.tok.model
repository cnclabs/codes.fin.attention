table of contents critical accounting estimates 
accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
our company we are the world s leading provider of hard disk drives based on revenue 
we design  manufacture  market and sell hard disk drives 
hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives  hard drives or hdds  are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces 
the performance attributes of disk drives  including their cost effectiveness and high storage capacities have resulted in disk drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data 
we produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications  where our products are designed for enterprise servers  mainframes and workstations  client compute applications  where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers  and client non compute applications  where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs  personal data backup systems  portable external storage systems and digital media systems 
in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives  we provide data storage services for small to medium sized businesses  including online backup  data protection and recovery solutions 
business overview our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning  financial condition and results of operations 
demand trends for disk drives we believe the total available market tam for disk drives  in aggregate  increased approximately in fiscal year  over the prior fiscal year 
we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage  back up and use such content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products 
however  the disk drive industry is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions as experienced in fiscal year historically  the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives 
solid state drives ssds  using nand flash memory  are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage 
nand flash memory is a type of non volatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data 
however  we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client non compute markets  will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industry s ability to deliver reliable  power consumption efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 
disk drives for enterprise storage 
we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 
mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises  requiring high performance  and high reliability disk drives 
we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to be driven by enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings 
we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient  smaller form factor disk drives 
these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 
nearline applications are defined as applications that are less time critical but capacity intensive  such as reference data environments or redundancy for recovery purposes  which require high capacity and low power consumption disk drives featuring lower costs per gigabyte 
we expect such applications  which 
table of contents include storage for cloud computing and backup services  will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes as data centers expand and proliferate 
we believe that the enterprise storage tam increased  as compared to the prior fiscal year  due to the deferral of information technology equipment purchases experienced in fiscal year  when storage utilization rates of existing disk drives in data centers increased 
ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives 
in addition  enterprises are beginning to use ssds in applications where rapid processing and or lower power consumption is required 
the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the pricing and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 
disk drives for client compute 
we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications 
in the near term  we believe that demand growth in client compute applications will be driven by what we believe to be an accelerating corporate technology refresh cycle 
in the long term  we believe that the proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market 
we believe that the client compute storage tam increased as compared to the prior fiscal year mainly due to the strength in consumer spending for technology for most of the fiscal year 
as the proliferation of client compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets and netbooks continues  nand flash technology could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 
disk drives for client non compute 
we define client non compute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external and network attached storage nas 
disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity  lower cost per gigabyte storage solution 
disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup  portable external storage and to augment the consumer s current desktop  notebook or dvr disk drive capacities 
client non compute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater 
we believe the proliferation of high definition and media rich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions  as evidenced by an increase in the client non compute tam of  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology  which have contributed to rapid product life cycles 
as a result  success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the first to market with new products  allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced 
also  because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion  the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness 
changing technology also necessitates on going investments in research and development  which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines 
further  there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions  as factors such as quality  reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 
price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity  performance and feature sets like for like products 
price declines for like for like products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share  
table of contents few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings  temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand  and seasonally weaker demand  which may cause excess supply 
disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity  better performance and additional feature sets and or product cost reductions 
to remain competitive  we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products 
we experienced muted price erosion for the first nine months of fiscal year as our industry experienced unmet demand due to industry wide supply constraints during the first half of fiscal year  and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march quarter 
however  in the june quarter  industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter 
seasonality the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year 
this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back to school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 
in addition  corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 
for most of fiscal year  our industry observed a muted seasonal pattern as the hard disk drive industry experienced unmet demand due to industry wide supply constraints  while in the march quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced 
however  in the june quarter  industry supply exceeded demand  which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter 
disk drive industry consolidation due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so  the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry 
the trend toward consolidation is more pronounced during times of macroeconomic contraction 
for example  toshiba corporation acquired fujitsu limited s hard disk drive business in october the increasing technological challenges  associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of large scale operations may also drive future industry consolidation 
additionally  we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 
suppliers of components and industry constraints due to industry consolidation  there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components  such as recording heads and media  available to disk drive manufacturers 
vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers  who manufacture their own components  are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 
we believe the supply chain was generally tight for the industry during most of fiscal year availability of glass substrates  finished media and heads improved during the june quarter 
however  supply of these critical components is still expected to be generally tight for the second half of the calendar year  reflecting typical seasonal patterns 

table of contents recording heads and media we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products  such as recording heads and media 
a vertically integrated model  however  tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates because it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 
the extent of our use of externally sourced recording heads  media and aluminum substrates varies based on product mix  technology and our internal capacity levels 
we purchase from third parties all of our glass substrates  which we use to manufacture disk drives for our inch products 
commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires precious metals  scarce alloys and industrial commodities  which are subject to fluctuations in prices  and the supply of which has at times been constrained 
we believe that currently there is an adequate supply of these precious metals  scarce alloys and industrial commodities 
additionally  volatility in fuel costs may increase our costs related to commodities  manufacturing and freight 
as a result  we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 
industry supply balance from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand 
to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize  price erosion may become more pronounced 
conversely  during periods where demand exceeds supply  price erosion is generally muted 
for the first half of fiscal year  our industry experienced unmet demand due to industry wide supply constraints  while in the march quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced 
however  in the june quarter  industry supply exceeded demand  which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter 
fiscal year summary revenues for fiscal year were billion and gross margins were  which represented a increase in revenues and growth in our gross margins from in the prior fiscal year 
we shipped million units during fiscal year  which represents an growth over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in revenue reflects an industry wide supply constraint experienced in the first half of fiscal year and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march quarter resulting in muted price erosion 
however  in the june quarter  industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter 
given that over of seagate s revenues are from sales to oems  where pricing agreements are negotiated in advance of the quarter  a large part of our business was insulated from price declines in the june quarter 
in the september quarter  however  we anticipate the adverse pricing environment will carry through to our entire product portfolio and will have a more pronounced impact on our gross margin 
we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in fiscal year we generated operating cash flow of  million  used approximately million to repurchase million of our common shares and used million for capital expenditures 
in may  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may the notes 
additionally  we repaid approximately million in existing debt and short term borrowings during the year

product development expense 
product development expenses for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year  which was a week fiscal year 
these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of million in headcount related expenses in fiscal year  million due to the cessation of certain product development activities  and million due to the non recurrence of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh facility 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million for variable performance based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year compared to none in fiscal year  and a million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year marketing and administrative expense 
marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year  which was a week fiscal year 
these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of million in headcount related expenses  million in advertising costs  and million in legal expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million for variable performance based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year compared to none in fiscal year  and a million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year as certain intangibles relating to the maxtor corporation maxtor and metalincs  inc acquisitions have been fully amortized 
restructuring and other  net 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million mainly comprised of charges related to our amk restructuring plan announced in august and additional restructuring charges related to our pittsburgh facility and facilities acquired as a part of the maxtor acquisition 
restructuring and other  net decreased approximately million when compared to the prior fiscal year  which include restructuring plans announced in january and may that were intended to realign our cost structure with the fiscal year macroeconomic business environment 
see prior year explanation for further details 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries 
during fiscal year  we committed to a plan to sell certain equipment related to certain research activities that had ceased 
in connection with this plan  we reclassified these assets as held for sale and recorded a net impairment charge of approximately million to adjust the carrying value of these assets to the estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries decreased approximately billion when compared to the prior fiscal year due to the non recurrence of the billion impairment charge we recorded in fiscal year as a result of the significant adverse change to our business climate

the change in other income expense  net for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense resulting from higher average borrowing costs  a decrease in gains from foreign currency remeasurements of million  a million write down of an equity investment in fiscal year  a million decrease in interest income as a result of lower yields on our cash and investments and an million non recurring gain recognized on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal year these were partially offset by a million loss related to our deferred compensation plan assets recorded in fiscal year income taxes fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change provision for benefit from income taxes as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of  applied on a retrospective basis 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year compared to a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal year our fiscal year provision for income taxes included million of income tax expense recorded in the second quarter associated with an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets related to a reduction in our forecasted us taxable income 
in connection with our previously announced plans to move our corporate headquarters to ireland  we initiated certain pre reorganization steps which resulted in our existing cayman parent holding company becoming an irish tax resident in fiscal year our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and non us subsidiaries that operate in multiple non irish taxing jurisdictions 
our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china  malaysia  singapore  switzerland and thailand 
these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 
table of contents since we became an irish tax resident in fiscal year  the irish statutory rate of is used for purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for income taxes at the statutory rate and our effective tax rate 
for fiscal years and  a notional statutory rate was used 
our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to earnings in countries where we have tax holidays and tax incentive programs which are indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
our provision for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july  differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i non deductible goodwill impairments  ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  iv tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs  and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
based on our non us ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings our subsidiaries outside of ireland  we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 
dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed 
the amount of temporary differences including undistributed earnings related to outside basis differences in the stock of non irish resident subsidiaries considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland for which irish income taxes have not been provided was approximately billion 
the determination of the amount of irish tax that would accrue if such amount was remitted into ireland is not practicable 
at july   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately billion reflecting a decrease of approximately million in fiscal year the decrease in the valuation allowance includes a million reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year associated with revisions to our forecasts of us taxable income and a decrease associated with the utilization of tax net operating loss carry forwards in fiscal year as of july   the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately billion reflecting an increase of approximately million in fiscal year the increase in valuation allowance resulted primarily from the liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary  maxtor  effective june  and represented the net effects of the extinguishment of all deferred tax assets related to historical carryover tax attributes of maxtor and the increase in deferred tax assets related to tax net operating losses incurred in connection with the liquidation transaction 
at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain us taxable income in future periods 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we re evaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain us taxable income 
during fiscal year ended july   an enacted legislative change in us tax law was taken into account in computing our income tax provision 
the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  was enacted on november  this law allowed us to elect an increased carryback period for net operating losses incurred in or from two years to three  four or five years at our option 
we recorded an million income tax benefit as a result of the increased carryback period 

table of contents approximately million and million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  respectively  are subject to an annual limitation of million pursuant to us tax law 
effective at the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions in income taxes 
this guidance contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as a result of the implementation of the guidance  we increased our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption 
we accounted for the increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of million and an increase to goodwill of million 
the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million excluding interest and penalties 
as of july  and july   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties 
the unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate were million and million as of july  and july   respectively  subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of million as compared to a net benefit of million during fiscal year as of july   we had million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as compared to million as of july  during the fiscal year ended july   our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately million primarily due to i reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of million  ii reductions associated with effectively settled positions of million  iii a reduction of million associated with interpretation of tax law as a result of the final th circuit court of appeals decision relating to stock based compensation deductions  iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of million  and v increases from other activity  including non us exchange losses  of million 
during the months beginning july   we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next months 
however  the resolution and or timing of closure on open audits are highly uncertain as to when these events occur 
we file us federal  us state  and us tax returns 
the internal revenue service irs is currently examining fiscal years through for state and non us tax returns  we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year the statute of limitation for us federal returns is open for fiscal year and forward 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  june  change change revenue 
table of contents revenue in fiscal year decreased approximately  or billion  from fiscal year primarily due to declining global macroeconomic conditions 
these conditions resulted in a decrease in the number of disk drives shipped and a reduction in our asp from to per unit 
the decrease in our asp  as compared to fiscal year  resulted from an unfavorable product mix  as higher priced enterprise drives comprised a smaller percentage of the units shipped  and a near double digit price erosion during each of the first two quarters of fiscal year the near double digit price erosion we experienced was due to time to market delays in certain markets and a supply and demand imbalance resulting from a sharp decline in the tam in the december quarter 
sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately and of our gross revenue  for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  june  change change cost of revenue gross margin gross margin percentage for fiscal year  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased basis points primarily due to price erosion  lower capacity utilization  particularly in the december and the march quarters  and the delay in transitioning to more market competitive and cost efficient products in certain markets due to the residual effects of fiscal year execution issues 
in the december quarter  the supply and demand imbalance resulted in a very competitive pricing environment and significant price erosion  especially in the inch and inch ata markets

product development expense 
the decrease in product development expense for fiscal year was primarily due to million of variable performance based compensation expense in fiscal year while none was recognized in fiscal year restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to a further million reduction in product development expenses  as compared to fiscal year these cost reduction measures included the closure of the pittsburgh facility  headcount reductions and wage decreases that took place in the second half of fiscal year in addition  other employee benefits decreased by million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities and a million research grant was received in fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a week fiscal year in compared to 
table of contents weeks in fiscal year  million in operating expenses resulting from increased product development and licensing activities  and million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh facility 
marketing and administrative expense 
the decrease in marketing and administrative expense for fiscal year was primarily due to million of variable performance based compensation expense in fiscal year while none was recognized in fiscal year in the second half of the fiscal year  restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to further reductions of million in wages  million for reduced use of consultants and outside services  and million as a result of reduced travel 
additionally  other employee benefits decreased by million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a week fiscal year in compared to weeks in fiscal year amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was relatively flat for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year restructuring and other  net 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million comprised mainly of charges related to the restructuring plans announced in january and may  both intended to realign our cost structure with the macroeconomic business environment 
these charges consisted of million of employee termination benefits  million related to lease obligations associated with the site closures and million of other exit costs 
as of the dates we committed to these restructuring plans we estimated annual savings upon completion of million and million from the january and may restructuring plans  respectively  and million  million and million from the pittsburgh  milpitas and limavady site closures  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
during the december quarter  we determined that a significant adverse change to our business climate had occurred  which required that we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  principally intangible assets and property  equipment and leasehold improvements  for impairment 
we made this determination as evidence of a sustained and sharp deterioration in the general business environment  and specifically  all of our major markets  was building rapidly through the quarter 
several of our customers and other technology companies in the supply chain of our customers  as well as our competitors  reduced their financial outlook and or otherwise disclosed that they were experiencing very challenging market conditions with little visibility of a rebound 
in addition  prior to the start of the december quarter  the tam was estimated to be approximately million units 
at about eight weeks into the quarter  the outlook for the tam had decreased to be approximately million units 
after the close of the quarter  preliminary industry data indicated actual shipments for the december quarter were approximately million units 
in response to these adverse business indicators and the rapidly declining revenue trends experienced during our fiscal second quarter  we reduced our near term and long term financial projections 
consequently  we performed an analysis of goodwill for impairment  and of the recoverability and impairment of other long lived assets  in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and asc  property  plant  and equipment previously sfas no

our provision for income taxes recorded for fiscal year ended june  differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs  ii a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  and iii tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
in fiscal year  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately billion 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately million in fiscal year the increase in valuation allowance resulted primarily from the liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary  maxtor  effective june  and represented the net effects of the extinguishment of all deferred tax assets related to historical carryover tax attributes of maxtor and the increase in deferred tax assets related to losses incurred in connection with the liquidation transaction 
as of june   the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million 
approximately million of this amount was related to deferred tax assets acquired in the maxtor acquisition for which the related benefit would have been credited to goodwill if realized 
the net increase in the valuation allowance in fiscal year was million 

table of contents at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of million of these deferred tax assets was primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain us taxable income in future periods 
although realization was not assured  we believed that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
during fiscal year   several enacted us tax law changes were taken into account in computing our income tax provision as follows 
on july   the housing and economic recovery act of was enacted 
under this law  we could elect to accelerate a portion of our unused amt and research tax credits in lieu of the percent bonus depreciation enacted in february on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted to extend the acceleration of amt and research credits in lieu of bonus depreciation based on qualified capital additions through the end of calendar year we concluded that we qualified for and recorded income tax benefits of approximately million related to these accelerated credits 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law 
under this law  the research credit was retroactively extended through december  from december  this extension had no immediate impact on our tax provision due to valuation allowances that were recorded for the us deferred tax assets related to these additional credits 
as of july  and june   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties 
the unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate were million and million as of july  and june   respectively  subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 
as a result of the adoption of asc  business combinations in fiscal year  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of july  that would impact the effective tax rate was approximately million 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of million as compared to an expense of million during fiscal year as of july   we had million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as compared to million as of june  during fiscal year  our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately million primarily due to i reductions associated with audit activity of million  ii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of million  iii reductions associated with the maxtor liquidation transactions of million  iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of million  and v reductions from non us exchange gains of million 
approximately million of reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the period was recorded as a reduction to goodwill

these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries  nor do we expect them to in the next months 
we are not aware of any downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short term investments and accordingly  we do not believe the fair value of our short term investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july  the change in restricted cash and investments from the fiscal year ended july   was primarily due to the repayment of our million floating rate senior notes due at maturity and approximately million of open market purchases of our notes and senior notes due october the notes

liquidity sources  cash requirements and commitments our primary sources of liquidity as of july   consisted of approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and cash we expect to generate from operations 
we also had million in restricted cash and investments of which million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital  research and development  and capital expenditure needs  and to service our debt 
our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations  performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

during fiscal year  we terminated our credit facility  having repaid the previously drawn million earlier in the fiscal year 
in addition  our million floating rate senior notes were due and paid on october  we also repurchased approximately million of various debt issuances on the open market to reduce our outstanding debt obligations  and repaid our notes for million at maturity 
on may   we issued the notes for an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes were offered in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were issued by seagate hdd cayman  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of seagate technology cayman  and guaranteed by seagate technology cayman on a full and unconditional basis 
on july   we became a guarantor under the notes 
we intend to use the proceeds from the debt issuance to redeem  repay or repurchase existing debt and for general corporate purposes 
on january   our board of directors authorized an anti dilution share repurchase program  which was publicly announced on february  the repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our ordinary shares to offset increases in diluted shares  such as those caused by employee stock plans and convertible debt  used in the determination of diluted net income per share 
the timing and number of shares to be repurchased by us will be dependent on general business and market conditions  cash flows generated by future operations  the price of our ordinary shares  cash requirements for other investing and financing activities  and maintaining compliance with our debt covenants 
repurchases may be made through open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to rule b trading plans or other available means  such as by way of an accelerated share repurchase program  through block trades or through the purchase of call options or the sale of put options 
additionally  there is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the authority for the anti dilution share repurchase program will continue until terminated by our board of directors 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million of our common shares

purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services  which are enforceable and legally binding on us  and that specify all significant terms 
as of july   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million  none of which is expected to be paid within one year 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals  establishment of warranty accruals  accounting for income taxes  and the accounting for goodwill and other long lived assets 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts  valuation of inventory  valuation of share based payments and restructuring 
we believe that 
table of contents these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
establishment of sales program accruals 
we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand 
for the distribution channel  these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor s level of sales  order size  advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments 
for oem sales  rebates are typically based on an oem customer s volume of purchases from seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs 
we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements 
we estimate these contra revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors  including price reductions during the period reported  estimated future price erosion  customer orders  distributor sell through and inventory levels  program participation  customer claim submittals and sales returns 
our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals  and inventory and sell through levels reported by our distribution customers 
while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments  actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations 
as a result  actual payments under these programs  which may spread over several months after the related sale  may vary from the amount accrued 
accordingly  revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 
for example  if the pricing environment is more competitive than we anticipated  accruals for forward price protection rebates may be inadequate 
in periods when pricing is less competitive  accruals for forward price protection rebates may exceed actual payments 
in addition  during periods in which our distributors inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels  our contra revenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher 
currently  our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 
significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contra revenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
for fiscal years and  total sales programs have ranged from to of gross revenues 
in fiscal year  sales programs dropped to approximately of gross revenue  reflecting a more stable pricing environment resulting from industry wide supply constraints during the first half of fiscal year and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march quarter 
adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods have averaged of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years through any future shifts in the industry supply demand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels 
if such rebates and incentives trend upwards  revenues and margins will be reduced 
establishment of warranty accruals 
we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years 
our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods  estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues  if any 
we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates  or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

table of contents the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure  the cost to repair a unit  or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims differ from those we used in determining the warranty accrual 
since we typically outsource our warranty repairs  our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates 
we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives 
to the extent such sales fall below our forecast  warranty cost will be adversely impacted 
we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty 
any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income 
since fiscal year  favorable or unfavorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals have approximated or less of revenue 
our warranty cost was and of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates 
in fiscal year  the cost of new warranties issued exclusive of the impact of any adjustment to prior warranty liabilities was close to the historical range and amounted to approximately of revenue  but total warranty cost decreased to of revenue  which is at the low end of the historical range 
the decrease in total warranty cost for fiscal year was due to a favorable adjustment to pre existing liabilities as a result of changing to a lower cost repair vendor  other efforts to better leverage our warranty service infrastructure  and lower product failure rates 
any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as in repair or replacement costs may result in increased warranty accruals 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic asc  income taxes previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in applying  asc  we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions 
if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or provision will result 
the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain non us jurisdictions 
each period  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and  if necessary  we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly  our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 
as a result of improvements in the outlook for our future us taxable income  we completed a reassessment of our valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets 
in the june quarter  we decreased the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
accounting for goodwill  and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by asc  we test goodwill of our reporting units annually during our fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change  such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets previously sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test other long lived assets  
table of contents including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc step two and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group 
the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

a portion of these risks are hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
additionally  we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
at july   with the exception of our auction rate securities  we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than months and determined that no investments were other than temporarily impaired 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have fixed rate debt obligations 
we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt

we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures 
our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during fiscal years and  we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc  derivatives and hedging previously sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
all these forward contracts mature within months 
we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness during fiscal year  nor did we discontinue any material cash flow hedges for a forecasted transaction in the same period

other market risks 
we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our accounts receivable balances  our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio 
we monitor and limit our credit exposure for both our accounts receivable balances and our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations 
we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty  and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions 
additionally  the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
as of july   we had counterparty credit exposure of million comprised of the mark to market valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position 
changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results  but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 
we have exposure to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our non qualified deferred compensation plan the seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp 
in the quarter ended july   we entered into a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp plan liabilities 
we pay a floating rate  based on libor plus a spread  on the notional amount of the trs 
the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp plan liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees 
the contract term of the trs is one year and is settled on a monthly basis therefore limiting counterparty performance risk 
the terms of the trs required us to pledge initial collateral of million to the counterparty for the term of the contract 
additional collateral may be posted contingent on the counterparty s exposure to the market value of the trs 
as of july   we had million pledged to the counterparty  recorded as restricted cash 
during fiscal year  approximately million of our auction rate securities were called by the issuers 
as of july   we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately million  all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program 
beginning in the march quarter  these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction 
as of july   the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was million 
we believe that the impairments totaling million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis 
as such  the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as long term investments
