we expect to make a cash contribution to our pension plans in critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected 
for all other customers  it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions 
the company evaluates all receivables that are over days old and will reserve specifically on a day basis 
the company has a secured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases 
this allows the company  in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy usually chapter  to repossess the customer s inventory 
this also allows alamo group to maintain only a reserve over its cost  which usually represents the margin on the original sales price 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  at december   and  at december  the increase was mainly from the company s european operations 
sales discounts at december   the company had  in reserves for sales discounts compared to  at december  on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs 
the decrease was due primarily to lower sales activity of the company s agricultural products during the pre season  which runs from september to december of each year with orders shipped through the first quarter of the company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time 
the company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
historically  between and of the company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available 
inventories obsolete and slow moving the company had a reserve of  at december  and  at december  to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the increase in the reserve was mainly from the company s us operations 
the obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows no inventory usage over a three year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent  and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three year supply 
there are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the company  based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification 
in cases where there is no historical data  management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves  if any  are appropriate 
new products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three year history has been established 
the reserve is reviewed and  if necessary  adjustments are made on a quarterly basis 
the company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve 
the company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated 
warranty the company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and days on parts 
warranty reserve  as a percentage of sales  is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety day to six month lag period 
the company s historical experience is that an end user takes approximately days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim 
a warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group 
reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required 
the current liability warranty reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  the increase came mainly from the acquisition of bush hog 
goodwill goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually 
in the fourth quarter of each year  or when events and circumstances warrant such a review  the company tests the goodwill of all of its reporting units for impairment 
the goodwill impairment test is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  then a charge is recorded to reduce goodwill to the implied goodwill 
the implied goodwill is calculated based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation similar to the requirements of sfas no  business combinations  in that it takes the implied fair value of the reporting unit and allocates such fair value to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty 
the company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios  which require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses 
the company believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 
the company recognized goodwill impairment in the north american industrial segment of  in and  in the north american agricultural segment in no goodwill impairment was recorded in as of december   goodwill was  which represents of total assets 
during the impairment analysis review  it was noted that even though the schwarze reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different 
at december   there was approximately million of goodwill related to the schwarze reporting unit 
this reporting unit would be most likely affected by changes in the company s assumptions and estimates 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates  discount rates  etc 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various financial market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk international sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france  canada and australia 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financials  specifically the value of its foreign assets  could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the company distribute their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company s uk subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
at december   the fair value of these agreements was in a favorable position  therefore  the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a gain of  which has been recognized in other income expense  net 
exposure to exchange rates the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominantly in european countries  canada and australia  as a result of the sale of its products in international markets 
foreign currency forward contracts in the uk are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ended december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a gain of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and the euro closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and the euro closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
however  the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty
