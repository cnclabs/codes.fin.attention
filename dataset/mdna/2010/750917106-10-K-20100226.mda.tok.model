risk factors risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
see also special note regarding forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
risks associated with our business  industry and market conditions if market leaders do not adopt our innovations  our results of operations could decline 
an important part of our strategy is to penetrate our target market segments by working with leaders in those market segments 
this strategy is designed to encourage other participants in those segments to follow such leaders in adopting our innovations 
if a high profile industry participant adopts our innovations but fails to achieve success with its products or adopts and achieves success with a competing technology  our reputation and sales could be adversely affected 
for example  if our commercial relationships with samsung do not achieve success  our reputation could be adversely affected given the market position of samsung as a leading memory manufacturer 
in addition  some industry participants have adopted  and others may in the future adopt  a strategy of disparaging our memory solutions adopted by their competitors or a strategy of otherwise undermining the market adoption of our solutions 
we target system companies to adopt our chip interface technologies  particularly those that develop and market high volume business and consumer products  which were traditionally focused on pcs  including pc graphics processors  and video game consoles  and now include hdtvs  cellular and digital phones  pdas  digital cameras and other consumer electronics that incorporate all varieties of memory and chip interfaces 
in particular  our strategy includes gaining acceptance of our technology in high volume consumer applications  including video game consoles  such as the sony playstation  hdtvs and set top boxes 
as we diversify our technologies  such as through the establishment of our lighting technology division  we will seek out other target markets in and related to computing  gaming and graphics  consumer electronics  mobile and general lighting applications 
we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence whether or not a potential licensee or partner company will adopt our technologies  including  among others competition faced by a company in its particular industry  the timely introduction and market acceptance of a company s products  the engineering  sales and marketing and management capabilities of a company  technical challenges unrelated to our innovations faced by a company in developing its products  the financial and other resources of a company  the supply of semiconductors from our memory and chip interface licensees in sufficient quantities and at commercially attractive prices  the ability to establish the prices at which the chips containing our chip interfaces are made available to system companies  and the degree to which our licensees promote our innovations to their customers 
there can be no assurance that consumer products that currently use our technology will continue to do so  nor can there be any assurance that the consumer products that incorporate our technology will be successful in their markets in order to generate expected royalties  nor can there be any assurance that any of our technologies selected for licensing will be implemented in a commercially developed or distributed product 
if any of these events occur and market leaders do not successfully adopt our technologies  our strategy may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations could decline 

table of contents we have traditionally operated in an industry that is highly cyclical and in which the number of our potential customers may be in decline as a result of industry consolidation  and we face intense competition in all of our target markets that may cause our results of operations to suffer 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been impacted by price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition 
as the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  significant economic downturns characterized by diminished demand  erosion of average selling prices  production overcapacity and production capacity constraints could affect the semiconductor industry 
we are currently experiencing such a period of economic downturn 
as a result  we may face a reduced number of licensing wins  tightening of customers operating budgets  difficulty or inability of our customers to pay our licensing fees  extensions of the approval process for new licenses and consolidation among our customers  all of which may adversely affect the demand for our technology and may cause us to experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our customers operate in industries that have experienced significant declines as a result of the current economic downturn 
in particular  dram manufacturers  which make up a majority of our existing and potential licensees  have suffered material losses and other adverse effects to their businesses 
these factors may result in industry consolidation as companies seek to reduce costs and improve profitability through business combinations 
consolidation among our existing dram and other customers may result in loss of revenues under existing license agreements 
consolidation among companies in the dram and other industries within which we license our technology may reduce the number of future licensees for our products and services 
in either case  consolidation in the dram and other industries in which we operate may negatively impact our short term and long term business prospects  licensing revenues and results of operations 
some semiconductor companies have developed and support competing logic chip interfaces including their own serial link chip interfaces and parallel bus chip interfaces 
we also face competition from semiconductor and intellectual property companies who provide their own ddr memory chip interface technology and solutions 
in addition  most dram manufacturers  including our xdrtm licensees  produce versions of dram such as sdr  ddrx  gddrx sdram and lpddrx which compete with xdrtm chips 
we believe that our principal competition for memory chip interfaces may come from our licensees and prospective licensees  some of which are evaluating and developing products based on technologies that they contend or may contend will not require a license from us 
in addition  our competitors are also taking a system approach similar to ours in seeking to solve the application needs of system companies 
many of these companies are larger and may have better access to financial  technical and other resources than we possess 
wider applications of other developing memory technologies  including flash memory  may also pose competition to our licensed memory solutions 
jedec has standardized what it calls extensions of ddr  known as ddr and ddr other efforts are underway to create other products including those sometimes referred to as gddr and gddr  as well as new ways to integrate products such as system in package dram 
to the extent that these alternatives might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost than xdrtm memory chips  or are perceived to require the payment of no or lower royalties  or to the extent other factors influence the industry  our licensees and prospective licensees may adopt and promote alternative technologies 
even to the extent we determine that such alternative technologies infringe our patents  there can be no assurance that we would be able to negotiate agreements that would result in royalties being paid to us without litigation  which could be costly and the results of which would be uncertain 
in the industry standard and leadership serial link chip interface business  we face additional competition from semiconductor companies that sell discrete transceiver chips for use in various types of systems  from semiconductor companies that develop their own serial link chip interfaces  as well as from competitors  such as arm and synopsys  which license similar serial link chip interface products and digital controllers 
at the gb s speed  competition will also come from optical technology sold by system and semiconductor companies 
there are standardization efforts under way or completed for serial links from standard bodies such as pci sig and oif 
we may face increased competition from these types of consortia in the future that could negatively impact our serial link chip interface business 
in the flexiotm processor bus chip interface market segment  we face additional competition from semiconductor companies who develop their own parallel bus chip interfaces  as well as competitors who license similar parallel bus chip interface products 
we may also see competition from industry consortia or standard setting bodies that could negatively impact our flexiotm processor bus chip interface business 
as with our memory chip interface products  to the extent that competitive alternatives to our serial or parallel logic chip interface products might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost  or are perceived to require the payment of no or 
table of contents lower royalties  or to the extent other factors influence the industry  our licensees and prospective licensees may adopt and promote alternative technologies  which could negatively impact our memory and logic chip interface business 
our newly established lighting technology division faces competition from system and subsystem providers of backlighting and general lighting solutions  some of which have substantial resources and operations 
if for any of these reasons we cannot effectively compete in these primary market segments  our results of operations could suffer 
if our new lighting technology division does not succeed  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the future success of our new lighting technology division  formed in connection with the recent acquisition of certain technology and a portfolio of advanced lighting and optoelectronics patents of global lighting technologies  depends on our ability to improve the visual capabilities  form factor  power efficiency and cost effectiveness of backlighting of lcd displays in products for computing  gaming and graphics  consumer electronics  mobile and general lighting applications 
we will need to keep pace with rapid changes in advanced lighting and optoelectronics technology  changing consumer requirements  new product introductions and evolving industry standards  any of which could render our existing technology obsolete if we fail to respond in a timely manner 
the development  application and licensing of new backlit lighting technologies is a complex process subject to a number of uncertainties  including the integration of our lighting technology division into the rest of our company and the small size of the lighting technology division 
our competitors have significant marketing  workforce  financial and other resources and longer operating history which could make acceptance of our lighting technologies more difficult 
if others develop innovative proprietary lighting technology that is superior to ours or if we fail to accurately anticipate technology and market trends  respond on a timely basis with our own new enhancements and technology  and achieve broad market acceptance of these enhancements and technology  our competitive position may be harmed and our operating results may be adversely affected 
in order to grow  we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated  which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  our entry into new markets  and or development of new technologies or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts  our operating expenses would increase 
for the years ended december   and  research and development expenses were million  million and million  respectively  including stock compensation of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue  especially with respect to our new lighting technology division and any other new technologies that we pursue outside of our core memory and chip interface technologies  our operating results could decline 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development  including as a result of our investment in new technologies  and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 
in order to grow  which may include entering new markets and or developing new technologies  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as selectively hiring additional employees 
our revenue is concentrated in a few customers  and if we lose any of these customers  our revenue may decrease substantially 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration 
as a result of our settlement with samsung  samsung is expected to account for a significant portion of our ongoing licensing revenue commencing in our top five licensees represented approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue from amd  fujitsu  nec  panasonic  and toshiba  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from amd  elpida  fujitsu  nec  panasonic  and sony  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from elpida  fujitsu  qimonda and toshiba  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
we expect to continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
in addition  some of our commercial agreements require us to provide certain customers with the lowest royalty rate that we provide to other customers for similar technologies  volumes and schedules 
these clauses may limit our ability to effectively price differently among our customers  to respond quickly to market forces  or otherwise to compete on the basis of price 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and 
table of contents prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we anticipate that revenue will continue to be concentrated in a limited number of licensees 
we are in negotiations with licensees and prospective licensees to reach patent license agreements for dram devices and dram controllers 
we expect that patent license royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
a number of our material license agreements are scheduled to expire throughout  including certain ones that accounted for more than of our revenue in the year ended december  we are currently in discussions with those licensees whose agreements are scheduled to expire in however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will reach agreement on renewal terms or that the royalty rates we will be entitled to receive under the new agreements will be as favorable to us as our current agreements 
if we are unsuccessful in renewing any of these patent license agreements  our results of operations may decline significantly 
weak global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services 
our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions  and the us and world economies continue to experience weak economic conditions 
uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and declines in income or asset values  which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the products of our licensees in the foreseeable future 
other factors that could influence demand include continuing increases in fuel and energy costs  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures  from companies that have competing products  changes in the credit market  conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets  consumer confidence  and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior 
if our licensees experience reduced demand for their products as a result of economic conditions or otherwise  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
if our counterparties are unable to fulfill their financial and other obligations to us  our business and results of operations may be affected adversely 
any downturn in economic conditions could threaten the financial health of our counterparties  including companies with whom we have entered into licensing arrangements  settlements agreements or that have been subject to litigation judgments that provide for payments to us  and their ability to fulfill their financial and other obligations to us 
economic downturns such as the one we are currently experiencing lead to financial pressures on our counterparties and may eventually lead to bankruptcy proceedings or other attempts to avoid financial obligations that are due to us under licenses  settlement agreements or litigation judgments 
because bankruptcy courts have the power to modify or cancel contracts of the petitioner which remain subject to future performance and alter or discharge payment obligations related to pre petition debts  we may receive less than all of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from any such counterparty as a result of a bankruptcy proceedings 
in  two of our counterparties  qimonda and spansion  were subject to insolvency proceedings in their applicable jurisdictions as a result of a downturn in business 
qimonda  which was a party to a settlement and licensing agreement with us  is under the process of being liquidated under its german insolvency proceeding 
as part of the process  the administrator for qimonda s insolvency informed us that our license agreement was terminated 
under the license agreement  if we entered into licenses with certain other dram manufacturers  qimonda would have been required to make certain additional payments to us up to an aggregate of million 
given the status of qimonda s liquidation and the notice of termination of the license agreement  we do not believe that even if we satisfied the conditions for additional payments  we will obtain any future payment from qimonda or the successors to its business 
spansion  which was one of our licensees that owed us an immaterial amount  is in the process of exiting a voluntary chapter reorganization 
if we are unable to collect all of such payments owed to us  or if other of our counterparties enter into bankruptcy or otherwise seek to renegotiate their financial obligations to us as a result of the deterioration of their financial health  our business and results of operations may be affected adversely 
our business and operating results may be harmed if we undertake any restructuring activities or if we are unable to manage growth in our business 
from time to time  we may undertake to restructure our business 
there are several factors that could cause a restructuring to have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these include potential disruption of our operations  
table of contents the development of our technology  the deliveries to our customers and other aspects of our business 
employee morale and productivity could also suffer and we may lose employees whom we want to keep 
loss of sales  service and engineering talent  in particular  could damage our business 
any restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work 
employee reductions or other restructuring activities also cause us to incur restructuring and related expenses such as severance expenses 
moreover  we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans  which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense 
our business historically experienced periods of rapid growth that placed significant demands on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
in the event that we return to such a period of growth  whether through internal expansion or acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  we would need to improve and expand our management  operational and financial systems and controls 
we also would need to expand  train and manage our employee base 
we cannot assure you that in connection with any such growth we will be able to timely and effectively meet demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and licensees 
if we ineffectively manage our growth or we are unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining personnel  our business and operating results will be harmed 
if we cannot respond to rapid technological change in our target markets by developing new innovations in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results will suffer 
we derive most of our revenue from our chip interface technologies that we have patented 
we expect that this dependence on our fundamental technology will continue for the foreseeable future 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with new generations of semiconductors being introduced periodically and with ongoing improvements 
the introduction or market acceptance of competing chip interfaces that render our chip interfaces less desirable or obsolete would have a rapid and material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the announcement of new chip interfaces by us could cause licensees or system companies to delay or defer entering into arrangements for the use of our current chip interfaces  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on the semiconductor industry to develop test solutions that are adequate to test our chip interfaces and to supply such test solutions to our customers and us 
our continued success depends on our ability to introduce and patent enhancements and new generations of our chip interface technologies that keep pace with other changes in the semiconductor industry and which achieve rapid market acceptance 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to addressing the ever increasing need for higher speed chip interfaces associated with increases in the speed of microprocessors and other controllers 
the technical innovations that are required for us to be successful are inherently complex and require long development cycles  and there can be no assurance that our development efforts will ultimately be successful 
in addition  these innovations must be completed before changes in the semiconductor industry render them obsolete  available when system companies require these innovations  and sufficiently compelling to cause semiconductor manufacturers to enter into licensing arrangements with us for these new technologies 
significant technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before their commercial viability can be determined  and this concept applies to all of our target markets 
there can be no assurance that we have accurately estimated the amount of resources required to complete our innovation efforts  or that we will have  or be able to expend  sufficient resources required for the development of our innovations 
in addition  there is market risk associated with these products for which we develop technological innovations  and there can be no assurance that unit volumes  and their associated royalties  will occur 
if our technology fails to capture or maintain a portion of the high volume target consumer market  our business results could suffer 
some of our revenue is subject to the pricing policies of our licensees over whom we have no control 
we have no control over our licensees pricing of their products and there can be no assurance that licensee products using or containing our chip interfaces will be competitively priced or will sell in significant volumes 
one important requirement for our memory chip interfaces is for any premium charged by our licensees in the price of memory and controller chips over alternatives to be reasonable in comparison to the perceived benefits of the chip interfaces 
if the benefits of our technology do not match the price 
table of contents premium charged by our licensees  the resulting decline in sales of products incorporating our technology could harm our operating results 
our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly and our marketing and licensing efforts may be unsuccessful 
the process of persuading customers to adopt and license our chip interface and other technologies can be lengthy and  even if successful  there can be no assurance that our technologies will be used in a product that is ultimately brought to market  achieves commercial acceptance  or results in significant royalties to us 
we generally incur significant marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements  generating a license fee and establishing a royalty stream from each licensee 
the length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship can take many months or even years 
in addition  our ongoing intellectual property litigation and regulatory actions have and will likely continue to have an impact on our ability to enter into new licenses and renewals of licenses 
as such  we may incur costs in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins  if at all 
if our marketing and sales efforts are very lengthy or unsuccessful  then we may face a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of delay or failure to obtain royalties 
future revenue is difficult to predict for several reasons  and our failure to predict revenue accurately may cause us to miss analysts estimates and result in our stock price declining 
our lengthy and costly license negotiation cycle and our ongoing intellectual property litigation make our future revenue difficult to predict because we may not be successful in entering into licenses with our customers on our estimated timelines and we are reliant on the litigation timelines for any results or settlements  such as our january settlement with samsung 
while some of our license agreements provide for fixed  quarterly royalty payments  many of our license agreements provide for volume based royalties  and may also be subject to caps on royalties in a given period 
the sales volume and prices of our licensees products in any given period can be difficult to predict 
as a result  our actual results may differ substantially from analyst estimates or our forecasts in any given quarter 
in addition  a portion of our revenue comes from development and support services provided to our licensees 
depending upon the nature of the services  a portion of the related revenue may be recognized ratably over the support period  or may be recognized according to contract accounting 
contract revenue accounting may result in deferral of the service fees to the completion of the contract  or may be recognized over the period in which services are performed on a percentage of completion basis 
there can be no assurance that the product development schedule for these projects will not be changed or delayed 
all of these factors make it difficult to predict future licensing revenue and may result in our missing previously announced earnings guidance or analysts estimates which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results are unpredictable and fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to be volatile and decline 
since many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profitability 
factors other than those set forth above  which are beyond our ability to control or assess in advance  that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include semiconductor and system companies acceptance of our chip interface products  the success of high volume consumer applications  such as the sony playstation  the dependence of our royalties upon fluctuating sales volumes and prices of licensed chips that include our technology  the seasonal shipment patterns of systems incorporating our chip interface products  the loss of any strategic relationships with system companies or licensees  semiconductor or system companies discontinuing major products incorporating our chip interfaces  the unpredictability of litigation results or settlements and the timing and amount of any litigation expenses  changes in our customers development schedules and levels of expenditure on research and development  
table of contents our licensees terminating or failing to make payments under their current contracts or seeking to modify such contracts  whether voluntarily or as a result of financial difficulties  the results of our efforts to expand into new target markets  such as with our lighting technology division  changes in our strategies  including changes in our licensing focus and or acquisitions of companies with business models or target markets different from our own  and changes in the economy and credit market and their effects upon demand for our technology and the products of our licensees 
we believe that royalties will continue to represent a majority of total revenue for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december   and  royalties accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
royalties are generally recognized in the quarter in which we receive a report from a licensee regarding the sale of licensed chips in the prior quarter  however  royalties are recognized only if collectability is assured 
as a result of these uncertainties and effects being outside of our control  royalty revenue is difficult to predict and makes it difficult to develop accurate financial forecasts  which could cause our stock price to become volatile and decline 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sources outside of the united states and this revenue and our business generally are subject to risks related to international operations that are often beyond our control 
for the years ended december   and  revenue from our sales to international customers constituted approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
as a result of our continued focus on international markets  we expect that future revenue derived from international sources will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
to date  all of the revenue from international licensees has been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties which are based as a percentage of the customer s sales that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
we currently have international operations in india design  japan business development  taiwan business development and germany business development 
our international operations and revenue are subject to a variety of risks which are beyond our control  including export controls  tariffs  import and licensing restrictions and other trade barriers  profits  if any  earned abroad being subject to local tax laws and not being repatriated to the united states or  if repatriation is possible  limited in amount  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes  including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding  income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions  foreign government regulations and changes in these regulations  social  political and economic instability  lack of protection of our intellectual property and other contract rights by jurisdictions in which we may do business to the same extent as the laws of the united states  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  cultural differences in the conduct of business both with licensees and in conducting business in our international facilities and international sales offices  
table of contents operating centers outside the united states  hiring  maintaining and managing a workforce remotely and under various legal systems  and geo political issues 
we and our licensees are subject to many of the risks described above with respect to companies which are located in different countries  particularly home video game console  pc and other consumer electronics manufacturers located in asia and elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the risks associated with our international operations could not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or enter into mergers  strategic transactions or other arrangements that could cause our business to suffer 
as part of our strategic initiatives  we have completed  currently are evaluating  and expect to continue to engage in  investments in or acquisitions of companies  products or technologies  and the entry into strategic transactions or other arrangements 
these acquisitions  investments  transactions or arrangements are likely to range in size  some of which may be significant 
after completing an acquisition  including the recent acquisition of technology and a patent portfolio from global lighting technologies  we may experience difficulty integrating that company s or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition the key personnel of the acquired entity or business may decide not to work for us or may not perform according to our expectations  we may experience additional legal  financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as licensing  tax planning  cash management and financial reporting  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not be able to recognize the financial benefits we anticipated  both with respect to our ongoing business and the acquired entity or business  our increasing international presence resulting from acquisitions may increase our exposure to international currency  tax and political risks  and our lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies may cause us to fail to recognize the forecasted financial and strategic benefits of the acquisition 
in connection with our strategic initiatives related to future acquisitions or mergers  strategic transactions or other arrangements  we may incur substantial expenses regardless of whether any transactions occur 
further  the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions simultaneously 
in addition  we may be required to assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire 
by assuming the liabilities  we may incur liabilities such as those related to intellectual property infringement or indemnification of customers of acquired businesses for similar claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which could involve restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or in the tax laws and regulations could expose us to additional income tax liabilities which could affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision or benefit for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as other factors 
our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision 
although we believe that our tax estimates are 
table of contents reasonable  the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions which could affect our operating results 
our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations  including the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as described elsewhere in this report 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  such as percentage of completion contracts  investments  income taxes  litigation  goodwill and intangibles  and other contingencies 
such methods  estimates  and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties  and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates  and judgments 
in addition  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in those methods  estimates  and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 
in particular  the measurement of share based compensation expense requires us to use valuation methodologies and a number of assumptions  estimates  and conclusions regarding matters such as expected forfeitures  expected volatility of our share price  and the exercise behavior of our employees 
changes in these factors may affect both our reported results including cost of contract revenue  research and development expenses  marketing  general and administrative expenses and our effective tax rate and any forward looking projections we make that incorporate projections of share based compensation expense 
furthermore  there are no means  under applicable accounting principles  to compare and adjust our reported expense if and when we learn about additional information that may affect the estimates that we previously made  with the exception of changes in expected forfeitures of share based awards 
factors may arise that lead us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future share based compensation arrangements  resulting in variability in our share based compensation expense over time 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business and operations could suffer 
our success is dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  compensate  motivate and retain qualified personnel  especially engineers  who can enhance our existing technologies and introduce new technologies 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant industry experience  is intense  in particular in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered and in the area of bangalore  india where we have a design center 
we are also dependent upon our senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management personnel  or key sales personnel in critical markets  or critical members of staff  or of a significant number of our engineers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could cause our business and operations to suffer 
our operations are subject to risks of natural disasters  acts of war  terrorism or widespread illness at our domestic and international locations  any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facility  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in the san francisco bay area 
the san francisco bay area is in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones 
our facility and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires  floods and similar events 
should an earthquake or other catastrophes  such as fires  floods  power loss  communication failure or similar events disable our facilities  we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business  which stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results 
acts of terrorism  widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities 
risks related to corporate governance and capitalization matters the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for holders to resell their shares when desired or at attractive prices 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol rmbs 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations which we expect to continue in the future in response to  among other things  the following 
table of contents new litigation or developments in current litigation  including an unfavorable outcome to us from court proceedings relating to our litigation with hynix  micron  nanya and nvidia and reaction to any settlements that we enter into with former litigants  such as samsung  any progress  or lack of progress  real or perceived  in the development of products that incorporate our innovations  our signing or not signing new licensees  announcements of our technological innovations or new products by us  our licensees or our competitors  positive or negative reports by securities analysts as to our expected financial results  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and other events or factors  and issuance of additional securities by us  such as our issuance of approximately million shares of common stock to samsung in connection with our settlement agreement in january in addition  the stock market in general  and prices for companies in our industry in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
because our outstanding senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of our notes 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that those sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including new securities and exchange commission  regulations and nasdaq rules  have historically created uncertainty for companies such as ours 
any new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
any new investment of resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed and our business and operations would suffer 
we have been party to  and may in the future be subject to  lawsuits relating to securities law matters which may result in unfavorable outcomes and significant judgments  settlements and legal expenses which could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
in connection with our stock option investigation  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors  as well as our current auditors  were subject to several stockholder derivative actions  securities fraud class actions and or individual lawsuits filed in federal court against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the complaints generally allege that the defendants violated the federal and state securities laws and state law claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty 
while we have settled the derivative and securities fraud class actions  the individual lawsuits continue to be adjudicated 
for more information about the historic litigation described above  see note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount of time to resolve these current and any future lawsuits is uncertain  and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
although we have expensed or accrued for certain liabilities that we believe will result from certain of these actions  the actual costs and expenses to defend and satisfy all of these lawsuits and any potential future litigation may exceed our current estimated accruals  possibly significantly 
unfavorable outcomes and significant judgments  settlements and legal expenses in litigation related to our past and any future securities law claims could have material adverse impacts on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents we are leveraged financially  which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs  and to defend our intellectual property 
we have indebtedness 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due june the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  litigation  general corporate or other purposes may be limited  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of the principal of our indebtedness as we are required to pay the principal amount of our convertible notes in cash upon conversion if specified conditions are met or when due  if upon any conversion of our notes we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with shares of our common stock or we are required to pay a make whole premium with shares of our common stock  our existing stockholders interest in us would be diluted  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments could result in events of default under such instruments  which could permit acceleration of all of our notes 
any required repayment of our notes as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 
if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due  we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness  seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms  that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
if securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us  our business or our market 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan  delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
pursuant to such provisions our board of directors is authorized  without prior stockholder approval  to create and issue preferred stock  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of common stock  our board of directors is staggered into two classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting  stockholder action by written consent is prohibited  
table of contents nominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements  certain provisions in our bylaws and certificate of incorporation such as notice to stockholders  the ability to call a stockholder meeting  advance notice requirements and action of stockholders by written consent may only be amended with the approval of stockholders holding of our outstanding voting stock  the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders is prohibited  and our board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws 
in addition  the provisions in our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to consummate an acquisition of our company 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which provides  subject to enumerated exceptions  that if a person acquires or more of our outstanding voting stock  the person is an interested stockholder and may not engage in any business combination with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired or more of our outstanding voting stock 
certain provisions of our outstanding convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change  holders of the notes will have the right  at their option  to require us to repurchase  at a cash repurchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes  all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in multiples of  we may also be required to issue additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of such notes in the event of certain fundamental changes 
litigation  regulation and business risks related to our intellectual property we face current and potential adverse determinations in litigation stemming from our efforts to protect and enforce our patents and intellectual property  which could broadly impact our intellectual property rights  distract our management and cause a substantial decline in our revenue and stock price 
we seek to diligently protect our intellectual property rights 
in connection with the extension of our licensing program to sdr sdram compatible and ddr sdram compatible products  we became involved in litigation related to such efforts against different parties in multiple jurisdictions 
in each of these cases  we have claimed infringement of certain of our patents  while the manufacturers of such products have generally sought damages and a determination that the patents in suit are invalid  unenforceable  and not infringed 
among other things  the opposing parties have alleged that certain of our patents are unenforceable because we engaged in document spoliation  litigation misconduct and or acted improperly during our to participation in the jedec standard setting organization including allegations of antitrust violations and unfair competition 
see note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that any or all of the opposing parties will not succeed  either at the trial or appellate level  with such claims or counterclaims against us or that they will not in some other way establish broad defenses against our patents  achieve conflicting results  or otherwise avoid or delay paying royalties for the use of our patented technology 
moreover  there is a risk that if one party prevails against us  other parties could use the adverse result to defeat or limit our claims against them  conversely  there can be no assurance that if we prevail against one party  we will succeed against other parties on similar claims  defenses  or counterclaims 
in addition  there is the risk that the pending litigations and other circumstances may cause us to accept less than what we now believe to be fair consideration in settlement 
any of these matters  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly  may cause delays including delays in negotiating licenses with other actual or potential licensees  will tend to discourage future design partners  will tend to impair adoption of our existing technologies and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from other business operations 
in addition  we may be unsuccessful in our litigation if we have difficulty obtaining the cooperation of former employees and agents who were involved in our business during the relevant periods related to our litigation and are now needed to assist in cases or testify on our behalf 
furthermore  any adverse determination or other resolution in litigation could result in our losing certain rights beyond the rights at issue in a particular case  including  among other things our being effectively barred from suing others for violating certain or all of our intellectual property rights  our patents being held invalid or unenforceable or not infringed  our being subjected to significant liabilities  our being required to seek licenses from third parties  our being prevented from licensing our patented technology  or our being required to renegotiate with current licensees on a temporary or permanent basis 
even 
table of contents if we are successful in our litigation  or any settlement of such litigation  there is no guarantee that the applicable opposing parties will be able to pay any damages awards timely or at all as a result of financial difficulties or otherwise 
delay or any or all of these adverse results could cause a substantial decline in our revenue and stock price 
an adverse resolution by or with a governmental agency could result in severe limitations on our ability to protect and license our intellectual property  and would cause our revenue to decline substantially 
from time to time  we are subject to proceedings by government agencies 
these proceedings may result in adverse determinations against us or in other outcomes that could limit our ability to enforce or license our intellectual property  and could cause our revenue to decline substantially 
in addition  third parties have and may attempt to use adverse findings by a government agency to limit our ability to enforce or license our patents in private litigations and to assert claims for monetary damages against us 
although we have successfully defeated certain attempts to do so  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not be successful in the future or that additional claims or actions arising out of adverse findings by a government agency will not be asserted against us 
further  third parties have sought and may seek review and reconsideration of the patentability of inventions claimed in certain of our patents by the us patent and trademark office pto and or the european patent office the epo 
currently  we are subject to several re examination proceedings  including proceedings initiated by hynix  micron and nvidia as a defensive action in connection with our litigation against those companies 
an adverse decision by the pto or epo could invalidate some or all of these patent claims and could also result in additional adverse consequences affecting other related us or european patents  including in our intellectual property litigation 
if a sufficient number of such patents are impaired  our ability to enforce or license our intellectual property would be significantly weakened and this could cause our revenue to decline substantially 
the pendency of any governmental agency acting as described above may impair our ability to enforce or license our patents or collect royalties from existing or potential licensees  as our litigation opponents may attempt to use such proceedings to delay or otherwise impair any pending cases and our existing or potential licensees may await the final outcome of any proceedings before agreeing to new licenses or pay royalties 
litigation or other third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to expend substantial resources and could prevent us from developing or licensing our technology on a cost effective basis 
our research and development programs are in highly competitive fields in which numerous third parties have issued patents and patent applications with claims closely related to the subject matter of our programs 
we have also been named in the past  and may in the future be named  as a defendant in lawsuits claiming that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event of a third party claim or a successful infringement action against us  we may be required to pay substantial damages  to stop developing and licensing our infringing technology  to develop non infringing technology  and to obtain licenses  which could result in our paying substantial royalties or our granting of cross licenses to our technologies 
threatened or ongoing third party claims or infringement actions may prevent us from pursuing additional development and licensing arrangements for some period 
for example  we may discontinue negotiations with certain customers for additional licensing of our patents due to the uncertainty caused by our ongoing litigation on the terms of such licenses or of the terms of such licenses on our litigation 
we may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a reasonable cost  or at all  which could cause us to expend substantial resources  or result in delays in  or the cancellation of  new product 
if we are unable to successfully protect our inventions through the issuance and enforcement of patents  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we have an active program to protect our proprietary inventions through the filing of patents 
there can be no assurance  however  that any current or future us or foreign patent applications will be approved and not be challenged by third parties  our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be challenged by third parties  the validity of our patents will be upheld  our patents will not be declared unenforceable  
table of contents the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  congress or the us courts or foreign countries will not change the nature or scope of rights afforded patents or patent owners or alter in an adverse way the process for seeking patents  changes in law will not be implemented that will affect our ability to protect and enforce our patents and other intellectual property  new legal theories and strategies utilized by our competitors will not be successful  or others will not independently develop similar or competing chip interfaces or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
if any of the above were to occur  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our inability to protect and own the intellectual property we create would cause our business to suffer 
we rely primarily on a combination of license  development and nondisclosure agreements  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  and contractual provisions to protect our non patentable intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
the growth of our business depends in large part on the use of our intellectual property in the products of third party manufacturers  and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights against them to obtain appropriate compensation 
in addition  effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  if we fail to do so  our business will suffer 
we rely upon the accuracy of our licensees recordkeeping  and any inaccuracies or payment disputes for amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements may harm our results of operations 
many of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis 
while licenses with such terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information  audits rarely are undertaken because they can be expensive  time consuming  and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees 
therefore  we typically rely on the accuracy of the reports from licensees without independently verifying the information in them 
our failure to audit our licensees books and records may result in our receiving more or less royalty revenue than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements 
if we conduct royalty audits in the future  such audits may trigger disagreements over contract terms with our licensees and such disagreements could hamper customer relations  divert the efforts and attention of our management from normal operations and impact our business operations and financial condition 
any dispute regarding our intellectual property may require us to indemnify certain licensees  the cost of which could severely hamper our business operations and financial condition 
in any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property  our licensees could also become the target of litigation 
while we generally do not indemnify our licensees  some of our license agreements provide limited indemnities  and some require us to provide technical support and information to a licensee that is involved in litigation involving use of our technology 
in addition  we may agree to indemnify others in the future 
any of these indemnification and support obligations could result in substantial expenses 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to indemnify or supply such support to our licensees  a licensee s development  marketing and sales of licensed semiconductors could be severely disrupted or shut down as a result of litigation  which in turn could severely hamper our business operations and financial condition as a result of lower or no royalty payments
