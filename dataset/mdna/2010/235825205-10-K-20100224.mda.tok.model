business strategy we continue to evaluate the strategy for each of our operating segments and to focus on driving operational improvements and restructuring our operations to improve profitability 
in  we began implementing the dana operating system an operational excellence system patterned after the toyota production system in our manufacturing facilities 
the lean operational standards and global metrics rolled out through this system were instrumental in helping us achieve the significant cost reductions in that enabled us to largely offset the effects of substantially lower production levels 
driving our cost structure down and improving our manufacturing efficiency will be critical to our future success as lower production levels will continue to be a major challenge affecting our business 

table of contents our business strategies will increasingly be directed at opportunities for profitably growing the business 
over the past two years  we ve worked with our customers to address program pricing 
the improvements on this front  combined with reductions to our cost structure  have improved the underlying profitability of our major customer programs 
these operational improvements  along with the actions we took in to reduce debt and strengthen our cash position through an equity offering  significantly improved our financial position 
as a result  we are better positioned today to pursue attractive growth opportunities in a number of our businesses  particularly outside north america 
our growth strategies include reinvigorating our product portfolio and capitalizing on technology advancement opportunities 
material advancements are playing a key role in this endeavor  with an emphasis on research and development of efficient technologies such as lightweight  high strength aluminum applications currently in demand 
further  we recently announced the consolidation of our heavy vehicle products north american engineering centers in kalamazoo  mi and statesville  nc with our light vehicle engineering center in maumee  oh 
a principal reason for this move was the opportunity to better share technologies among our businesses 
as we drive additional operational improvements  restructure the businesses and pursue growth opportunities  we intend to do so with a discipline that ensures continued improvement in profitability and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
sale of the structural products business in keeping with the strategy of continually evaluating our businesses  we announced in december that we had signed an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our structural products business to metalsa  sa de sa  the largest vehicle frame and structures supplier in mexico 
we will retain and continue to operate our longview  tx structural products operation 
the parties expect to complete the sale of all but the venezuelan operations in march  with venezuela being completed as soon as the necessary governmental approvals are obtained 
our structural products business had external sales of and segment ebitda of segments we manage our operations globally through six operating segments 
our products in the light vehicle market primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers oems with products for light trucks  sport utility vehicles  crossover utility vehicles  vans and passenger cars 
the operating segments in the light vehicle markets are lvd  structures  sealing and thermal 
as of january   the light axle and driveshaft segments were combined in line with our new management structure into the lvd segment with certain operations from these former segments moving to our commercial vehicle and off highway segments 
two operating segments  commercial vehicle and off highway  support the oems of medium duty classes and heavy duty class commercial vehicles primarily trucks and buses and off highway vehicles primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction and agricultural applications 
we revised our definition of segment earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization segment ebitda in the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements in item trends in our markets light vehicle markets rest of the world markets outside of north america will take on increasing importance for us as they experience greater growth 
during  overall global economic weakness impacted light vehicle production in these markets  just as it has in north america 
light vehicle production outside of north america of around million units in  was about lower than outside of north america  the production decline was most significant in europe where production levels were down 
table of contents about from in south america production was down around and asia pacific down about 
signs of improving market conditions were evident in the fourth quarter of in each of these three regions  fourth quarter production levels were the strongest of any quarter during for  our current outlook for light vehicle markets outside north america is unit production of around million 
we expect european production in to be flat to up around as compared to  with the other two regions being somewhat stronger south america up in the range and asia pacific higher than source global insight and csm worldwide 
north america production levels in the north american markets were negatively impacted by overall economic conditions beginning in the second half of and continuing through adding to the market challenges were bankruptcy reorganizations by two of the major north american automakers gm and chrysler 
as a consequence  north american light vehicle production of about million units in was about lower than in the light truck segment of the market where more of our programs are focused  production was down about 
while down significantly year over year  production levels increased dramatically during the second half of as gm and chrysler both emerged from relatively short bankruptcy reorganizations and improving market and overall economic conditions led to increased vehicle sales 
second half light vehicle unit production was around million units  nearly times first half production levels

north american light vehicle industry inventory levels have improved from the end of the days supply of total light vehicles in north america was at december   down from at the end of light truck inventory was days at december   down from days at december  with the reduction that has occurred  inventory levels at the end of are more in line with historical norms 
as such  near term production levels are likely to be driven more directly by vehicle sales 
source ward s automotive 
while the overall economic environment continues to be somewhat fragile  we expect the improving conditions during the second half of to carry into we expect north american light vehicle production to be around to million units  an increase of over we believe the strongest increases will be in passenger car production levels 
as we look at our primary pick up and suv light truck programs  we are forecasting production level increases in the range 
rapid technology changes on may   the us government announced plans for a new national fuel economy policy 
the program  which still requires us congressional approval  covers model years and would increase corporate average fuel economy cafe standards by five percent each year through the proposal requires that passenger vehicles achieve an industry standard of miles per gallon by  an average increase of eight miles per gallon per vehicle from the requirements 
while providing the regulatory certainty and predictability of nationwide standards versus previously proposed state by state standards  this change will require a rapid response by automakers 
it also represents an opportunity for suppliers that are able to produce highly engineered products that will help oems quickly meet these stricter carbon emission and fuel economy requirements 
the national academy of sciences estimates that fuel economy could be increased by percent without sacrificing vehicle size  performance  or safety 
midsize cars could average miles per gallon and large pickups nearly miles per gallon  all using existing technology to develop new components and applications 
suppliers such as dana that are able to provide these new components and applications will fare best in this new environment 
our materials and process competencies  product enhancements and new product technologies can provide oems with needed vehicle weight reduction  friction management and improved engine performance  assisting them in their efforts to meet the new and more stringent cafe requirements 

table of contents medium heavy vehicle markets rest of the world outside of north america  medium and heavy duty truck production has been severely impacted by the overall global economic weakness 
after increasing to about million units in  commercial vehicle production levels outside north america for declined more than to around million units in production levels in europe  particularly  declined about from the previous year 
with improving economic conditions  we expect that commercial vehicle production levels outside north america will begin to rebound in mostly during the second half of the year 
we currently expect production outside north america in to be around to million units 
source global insight and act 
north america developments in this region have a significant impact on our results as north america accounts for approximately of our sales in the commercial vehicle market 
production of heavy duty class vehicles during of approximately  units compares to  units produced in  a decline of 
in the medium duty class market  production of around  units was down from the prior year s production of  units 
the north american medium heavy truck market is being impacted by many of the same overall economic conditions negatively impacting the light vehicle markets  as customers are being cautious about the economic outlook and  consequently  new vehicle purchases 
we have begun to see signs of improving market conditions with new truck orders picking up in recent months  and we expect the strengthening market conditions to continue into we currently expect class production in north america to be around  to  units an increase of to as much as from on the medium duty class side  we expect production of about  to  units a slightly higher year over year increase than for class source global insight and act 
off highway markets our off highway business has become an increasingly more significant component of our total operations over the past few years 
unlike our on highway businesses  our off highway business is largely outside of north america  with more than of its sales coming from outside north america 
we serve several segments of the diverse off highway market  including construction  agriculture  mining and material handling 
our largest markets are the european and north american construction and agricultural equipment segments 
after being relatively strong through the first half of  customer demand in these markets began softening during the latter part of during  the adverse effects of a weaker global economy significantly reduced demand levels in these markets 
demand in the construction market was down from while demand in the agricultural market was down 
unlike the light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets  we have not seen signs of improvement in this market  and we do not expect to see improving conditions until late we currently expect that this segment s primary construction and agriculture markets could be somewhat weaker in than  or at the top end of our estimates  relatively flat year on year 
sales  earnings and cash flow outlook with the lower level of sales in  we focused on aggressively right sizing our costs 
we reduced the work force during by about  people and in we reduced our workforce by another  people 
additional reductions are expected in as we complete remaining restructuring actions and continue to identify opportunities to reduce our costs 
further  given the structural cost improvements that we have made  we are not expecting to bring back a large share of the salaried and indirect cost that was eliminated as sales levels improve in partially offsetting these expected operational cost improvements will be some higher costs associated with pension benefits and restoration of certain additional compensation programs 
we also completed several pricing and material recovery initiatives during the latter part of and into that benefited 
table of contents margins in these years 
while certain of these actions will provide additional margin improvement in  on balance we do not expect that pricing will be a significant factor in our year over year profitability 
during  we generated free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less bankruptcy related claim payments and capital expenditures of improved profitability  reduced working capital and disciplined capital expenditures all contributed to the free cash flow generated 
included in this amount is that was used for right sizing and restructuring the business 
based on the production outlook in our markets and the addition of some net new business  we currently expect our sales for to be higher by  growing to approximately  to  in addition to the margin contribution from higher sales  as indicated above  cost reduction actions are expected to provide incremental profit improvement 
combined  we expect these factors to improve profitability by approximately we expect to again generate positive free cash flow in these sales  earnings and cash flow projections are before considering the effects of the sale of substantially all of the structural products business 
a number of factors  including the timing of the sale  the duration of transition services  and our ability to impact retained costs will have an impact on these projections

additional debt reduction occurred in the second and third quarters of when the combination of dana repayments and purchases of debt by a wholly owned non us subsidiary of dana reduced our outstanding principal under our term facility by net of oid of with a cash outlay of covenants at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the amended term facility with a leverage ratio of compared to a maximum of and an interest coverage ratio of compared to a minimum of 
based on our current forecast assumptions  which include cost reduction actions  and other initiatives  we expect to be able to maintain compliance for the next twelve months and we believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt obligations and other commitments during this period 
however  there is uncertainty in the current environment and it is possible that the factors affecting our business could result in our not being able to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements or to maintain sufficient liquidity 
based on our financial covenants  we had additional borrowing capacity of at december  the borrowing available from our credit facilities was based on the borrowing base collateral of those lines 

table of contents global liquidity our global liquidity at december  was as follows cash and cash equivalents less deposits supporting obligations available cash additional cash availability from lines of credit in the us and europe total global liquidity as of december   the consolidated cash balance totaled  with of this amount located in the us approximately of our cash balance is in cash deposits that support certain of our obligations  primarily workers compensation 
in addition  is held by less than wholly owned subsidiaries where our access may be restricted 
our ability to efficiently access other cash balances in certain subsidiaries and foreign jurisdictions is subject to local regulatory  statutory or other requirements 
our current credit ratings are b and b from standard and poor s and moody s 
the principal sources of liquidity for our future cash requirements are expected to be i cash flows from operations  ii cash and cash equivalents on hand  iii proceeds related to our trade receivable securitization and financing programs and iv borrowings from the revolving facility 
our future ability to borrow the full amount of availability under our revolving credit facilities could be effectively limited by our financial covenants 
at december   there were no borrowings under our european trade receivable securitization program and of availability based on the borrowing base 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving facility but we had utilized for letters of credit 
based on our borrowing base collateral  we had availability at that date under the revolving facility of after deducting the outstanding letters of credit

table of contents contractual obligations we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts under various agreements 
these include payments under our long term debt agreements  rent payments under operating lease agreements and payments for equipment  other fixed assets and certain raw materials under purchase agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payments leases unconditional purchase obligations pension contribution retiree healthcare benefits uncertain income tax positions total contractual cash obligations notes principal payments on long term debt 
excludes oid and deferred fees which were prepaid 
these amounts represent future interest payments based on the debt balances at december payments related to variable rate debt are based on december  interest rates 
capital and operating leases related to real estate  vehicles and other assets 
the unconditional purchase obligations presented are comprised principally of commitments for procurement of fixed assets and the purchase of raw materials 
these amounts represent estimated contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans 
we have not estimated pension contributions other than the us beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
our us estimate for is a contribution of which is not included in the table above 
this amount represents estimated obligations under our non us retiree healthcare programs 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of the payments to be made in the future consider recent payment trends and certain of our actuarial assumptions 
there are no expected payments in related to the uncertain tax positions as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the fin liability in individual years beyond due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
as disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements in item  we expect to make a payment of approximately during the first half of in connection with finalizing the settlement of us income tax audits from through dividend obligations of approximately per quarter are accrued while all shares of our preferred stock are outstanding 
the payment of preferred dividends was suspended in november under the terms of our amended exit facility 
we are permitted under the terms of our amended exit facility to resume a dividend when our total leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 
at december  our ratio was

table of contents dividends accrued but not paid at december  of is at the discretion of the board of directors 
at december   we maintained cash balances of on deposit with financial institutions to support surety bonds  letters of credit and bank guarantees and to provide credit enhancements for certain lease agreements 
these surety bonds enable us to self insure our workers compensation obligations 
we accrue the estimated liability for workers compensation claims  including incurred but not reported claims 
accordingly  no significant impact on our financial condition would result if the surety bonds were called 
we have agreed  subject to certain conditions  to increase our equity interest in dongfeng dana axle co  ltd 
from to 
under the agreement  our additional interest is based on a valuation of the business which would result in an additional investment of to the actual investment could vary significantly from this range in the event that the parties mutually agree that the operating results and prospects of the venture at the expected closing date of june  support a higher valuation of the business 
contingencies for a summary of litigation and other contingencies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these contingencies are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations 
critical estimates are those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note to our consolidated financial statements in item income taxes accounting for income taxes is complex  in part  because we conduct business globally and therefore file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax provision  uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in our judgment  based upon available information  it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we consider the historical and projected future taxable income or loss in different tax jurisdictions and we review our tax planning strategies 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and other foreign jurisdictions where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
we are regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provisions include amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing 
table of contents authorities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
see additional discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in note to our consolidated financial statements in item retiree benefits accounting for pensions and opeb involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
these plan expenses and obligations are dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries and other consultants and are generally calculated independently of funding requirements 
the assumptions used  including inflation  discount rates  investment returns  life expectancies  turnover rates  retirement rates  future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and modified when appropriate based on historical experience  current trends and the future outlook 
changes in one or more of the underlying assumptions could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement  turnover and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates are developed based on our actual historical claims experience  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for our largest plans  discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is developed based on a subset of these high quality fixed income investments those with yields between the th and th percentiles 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
for our largest defined benefit pension plans  expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns  the impact of active management and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
opeb benefits are funded as they become due 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under the applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over future periods 
in we experienced significant differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets 
the most significant of our funded plans exist in the us and canada 
our us and canadian pension plans were heavily invested in government securities at the end of these securities were in great demand at that time due to the global financial crisis 
as the global crisis began to ease in  investors started to sell these securities as their appetite for risk and higher yields began to increase 
this shift in demand resulted in a declining market value for these securities 
a decrease in the fair value of plan assets will increase next year s pension cost because of the lower expected return on plan assets 
our financial position is also sensitive to changes in the high quality bond yield rates used to determine an appropriate discount rate 
over the later part of and into  the credit markets have stabilized resulting in a general decline in the yields on high quality corporate bonds of all maturities 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the benefit obligation 

table of contents as a result  at the end of  we have significant unrecognized net losses in accumulated other comprehensive income  principally in the us the amortization of these unrecognized losses is resulting in increased domestic net periodic pension cost 
our normal net periodic pension cost will change from a benefit of in before any curtailment impacts to a charge of in no cash contributions are required in however  we estimate a contribution approximating to our us plans will be required in a change in the pension discount rate of basis points would result in a change in our pension obligations of approximately and a change in pension expense of approximately a basis point change in the rate of return would change pension expense by approximately restructuring actions involving facility closures and employee downsizing and divestitures frequently give rise to adjustments to employee benefit plan obligations  including the recognition of curtailment or settlement gains and losses 
upon the occurrence of these events  the obligations of the employee benefit plans affected by the action are also re measured based on updated assumptions as of the re measurement date 
see additional discussion of our pension and opeb obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements in item long lived asset impairment we perform periodic impairment analyses on our long lived amortizable assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indications are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review of the fair value of the operations 
in structures we have impaired the long lived assets based on the expected proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of this segment 
in all of our other segments  a reduction in either the projected cash flows or the peer multiples would not result in impairment of long lived assets including the definite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of october of each year for all of our reporting units  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value of our off highway reporting unit and our intangible assets were reasonable 
in addition  a reduction in either the projected cash flows or the peer multiples in the off highway segment would not result in additional impairment in this segment 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the results 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we recorded goodwill impairment of in related to our driveshaft business segment 
indefinite lived intangible asset valuations are generally based on revenue streams 
we impaired indefinite lived intangible assets by in and in the eleven months ended december  additional reductions in forecasted revenue could result in additional impairment 
warranty costs related to product warranty obligations are estimated and accrued at the time of sale with a charge against cost of sales 
warranty accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate 
table of contents based on occurrences giving rise to potential warranty exposure and associated experience 
warranty accruals and adjustments require significant judgment  including a determination of our involvement in the matter giving rise to the potential warranty issue or claim  our contractual requirements  estimates of units requiring repair and estimates of repair costs 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
contingency reserves we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
fresh start accounting as required by gaap  in connection with emergence from chapter  we adopted fresh start accounting effective february  accordingly  the reorganization value represents the fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of dana immediately after restructuring 
the reorganization value is allocated to the respective fair value of assets 
the excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill 
liabilities  other than deferred taxes  are stated at present values of amounts expected to be paid 
fair values of assets and liabilities represent our best estimates based on our appraisals and valuations 
where the foregoing were not available  industry data and trends or references to relevant market rates and transactions were used 
these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond our reasonable control 
moreover  the market value of our common stock may differ materially from the fresh start equity valuation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse movements in commodity prices for products we use in our manufacturing and adverse changes in interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to these risks  we maintain risk management controls to monitor these risks and take appropriate actions to attempt to mitigate such forms of market risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risks we have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
our operating results are impacted by buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies 
wherever possible  we mitigate the impact by focusing on natural hedging techniques which include the following i structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flow subject to conversion risk  ii avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency and iii managing cash flows on a net basis both in timing and currency to minimize the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
after considering natural hedging techniques  some portions of remaining exposure  especially for anticipated inter company and third party commercial transaction exposure in the short term  may be hedged using financial derivatives  such as foreign currency exchange rate forwards 
some of our foreign entities were party to foreign currency contracts for anticipated transactions in us dollars  british pounds  swedish krona  euros  south african rand  indian rupees and australian dollars at the end of in addition to the transactional exposure discussed above  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate translation exposure 
risk from adverse movements in commodity prices we purchase certain raw materials  including steel and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by fluctuations in supply and 
table of contents demand as well as other factors 
to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices we have consolidated our supply base and negotiated fixed price supply contracts with many of our commodity suppliers 
in addition  we continue to negotiate with our customers to provide for the sharing of increased raw material costs 
no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of increased commodity costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
we had no derivatives in place at december  to hedge commodity price movements 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our floating rate exposure on borrowing under the amended exit facility 
under the terms of the exit facility we were required to enter into interest rate hedge agreements and to maintain agreements covering a notional amount of not less than of the aggregate loans outstanding under the term facility until january we have hedged interest on of the  outstanding at december  with an interest rate cap on the london interbank borrowing rate libor portion of the interest rate
