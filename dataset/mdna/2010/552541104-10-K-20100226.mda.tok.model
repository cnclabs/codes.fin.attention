item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates and assumptions made by management regarding specific business and operating factors as well as discount rates 
changes in estimates and assumptions  as well as the occurrence of various events or changes in circumstances  could have a material impact on the fair value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods  which in turn may result in material asset impairments 
similar considerations apply to any impairment evaluation of our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets as well as our determinations as to whether interim impairment tests are necessary 

table of contents the company periodically updates its long range business plans and forecasts  which include financial projections that are incorporated in the annual impairment tests 
estimated revenue growth rates for all reporting units may be lower than past projections due to the various factors discussed in this report  including  but not limited to  the following the continued adverse economic environment  which may negatively affect future revenue and margins as a result of lower demand and pricing pressure  check unit declines that have continued at a higher rate than in the past and are expected to continue to decline at higher rates than in recent years  which may negatively affect future revenue for our harland clarke segment  and continued worldwide consumption declines in tobacco products using licorice  which may negatively affect future revenue for our licorice products segment 
depending on the nature of these factors and the expected relative magnitude and permanency of their effects  the company s businesses may not be able to achieve previous levels of performance even when overall economic conditions improve 
during the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived tradenames  the company determined the fair value of the harland clarke tradename was less than its carrying value due to declines in revenues from check unit volumes that are projected to decline at rates that are higher than recent years and also due to the continuing economic downturn 
as a result of this impairment  the useful life of the harland clarke tradename was reassessed and determined to no longer be indefinite 
based on an analysis of future cash flows attributable to the harland clarke tradename  the company determined the economic life for the harland clarke tradename is years 
a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of based on the current fair value of the harland clarke tradename being less than its carrying value and the useful life was reclassified from an indefinite life to a life of years 
future impairment tests may result in a determination that there have been additional material asset impairments 
any asset impairment would be reported as a non cash operating loss  would have a negative effect on the company s earnings and total assets  and could have a negative impact on the market prices of the company s outstanding securities 
impairment charges in the future would not impact the company s consolidated cash flows  current liquidity  capital resources and covenants under its existing credit facilities 
difficult conditions in the financial markets and a general economic downturn may adversely affect the business and results of operations of the company and we cannot determine if these conditions will improve or worsen in the near future 
the economic conditions in late and and the volatility in the financial markets during this period have contributed and may continue to contribute to high unemployment levels  decreased consumer spending  reduced credit availability and or declining business and consumer confidence 
during this period  a number of financial institutions have taken significant write downs of asset values 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with other institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
we cannot determine whether the difficult conditions in the economy in general and or the financial markets will improve or worsen in the near future 
our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by these difficult conditions 
harland clarke may experience reduced revenues due to losses of customers in the event the financial institutions upon which it depends either merge with or are sold to other institutions  or fail  or in the event that consumer spending continues to decline  or checking account openings continue to decrease  resulting in further acceleration in the decline of check usage and the use of harland clarke s other products 
similarly  harland financial solutions  which also depends on its financial institution customers  may be adversely affected due to losses of financial institution customers from mergers  consolidations or failures 
reductions in financial institution information technology budgets in response to market difficulties could continue to result in further delays or cancellations of harland financial solutions client purchases  as well as potential pricing pressure on harland financial solutions products 
economic slowdown and liquidity constraints may also cause state and local public and private education budgets to be further reduced  which could continue to result in reduced revenues at scantron  as well as pricing pressure on 
table of contents scantron products 
in addition  further disruptions in the credit and other financial markets could  among other things  impair the financial condition of suppliers of the company  thereby increasing the risk of supplier performance 
account data breaches involving stored client data or misuse of such data could adversely affect our reputation  revenues  profits and growth 
we  our clients  and other third parties store customer account information relating to our harland clarke segment s checks 
in addition  a number of clients use our harland financial solutions products and scantron products to store and manage sensitive customer and student information 
scantron also provides services which involve the storage of non public customer information 
any breach of the systems on which sensitive customer data and account information are stored or archived and any misuse by our own employees  by employees of data archiving services or by other unauthorized users of such data could lead to fraudulent activity involving our clients and our financial institution clients customers information and or funds  damage the reputation of our brands and result in claims against us 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any lawsuit involving such data security breaches or misuse  we may be forced to pay damages  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes  revenue and future growth prospects 
in addition  such breaches could adversely affect our financial institution clients perception as to our reliability  and could lead to the termination of client contracts 
legislation and contracts relating to protection of personal data could limit or harm our future business 
we are subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as non public personal information 
examples include the federal financial modernization law known as the gramm leach bliley act and the regulations implementing its privacy and information security requirements  as well as other privacy and data security federal and state laws and regulations 
we are also subject to additional requirements in many of our contracts with financial institution clients  which are often more restrictive than the regulations 
these laws  regulations and agreements require us to develop and implement policies to protect non public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically thereafter 
the laws  regulations  and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose non public personal information for other than the purposes originally intended 
where not preempted by the provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  states may enact legislation or regulations that are more restrictive on our use of data 
in addition  more restrictive legislation or regulations have been introduced in the past and could be introduced in the future in congress and the states and could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or prospects 
additionally  future contracts may impose even more stringent requirements on us which could increase our operating costs  as well as interfere with the cost savings we are trying to achieve 
the financial services sector is also subject to various federal and state regulations and oversight 
as a supplier of services to financial institutions  certain operations of our harland clarke and harland financial solutions segments are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation  among other agencies  to confirm our ability to maintain data security 
these agencies regulate and audit services we provide and the manner in which we operate  and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 
adverse audit findings could impact our ability to continue to render services or require investment in corrective measures 
moreover  current laws and regulations may be amended in the future or interpreted by regulators in a manner which could negatively impact the operations of our harland clarke or harland financial solutions segments or limit their future growth 
the use of our scantron products and services to store and manage student and other educational data may be subject to the family education rights and privacy act of  commonly known as ferpa  which is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records in connection with scantron s web based assessment services 
many states have enacted similar laws to protect the privacy of student data 
the 
table of contents operation of websites by scantron that are accessed by children under the age of may be subject to the children s online privacy protection act of  commonly known as coppa 
the collection of patient data through scantron s survey services is subject to the health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  which protects the privacy of patient data 
scantron is also subject to the gramm leach bliley act 
new laws and regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet  e commerce or marketing practices generally relating to consumer privacy 
such laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet and or use of other sales or marketing vehicles 
as an example  new privacy laws could decrease traffic to our websites  decrease telemarketing opportunities and decrease the demand for our products and services 
additionally  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing property ownership  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may remain uncertain for a considerable length of time 
we may experience processing errors or software defects that could harm our business and reputation 
we use sophisticated software and computing systems in our harland clarke  harland financial solutions and scantron segments 
we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients 
furthermore  certain financial institution clients of our harland clarke segment have integrated certain components of their systems with ours  permitting our operators to effect certain operations directly into our financial institution clients customers accounts 
errors or delays in the processing of check orders  software defects or other difficulties could result in loss of clients  additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources  negative publicity  or exposure to liability claims 
we may not successfully implement any or all components of our business strategies or realize all of our continued cost savings  which could reduce our revenues and profitability 
important components of our business strategies for the businesses operated by harland clarke holdings are to cross sell between business segments  capitalize on complementary offerings across the client base of our harland clarke segment  cross sell software products into our combined client base  continue focusing on software enabled testing and assessment products while expanding the offering of survey services to financial institutions  and continue to reduce costs and generate strong cash flow 
we may not be able to fully implement any or all components of our business strategies or realize  in whole or in part or within the timeframes anticipated  the efficiency improvements or cost savings from these strategies 
these strategies are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
financial industry turmoil and the general economic slowdown may continue to adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategies 
additionally  our business strategies may change from time to time 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve our expected results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property  and third party infringement or misappropriation may materially adversely affect our profitability 
we rely on a combination of measures to protect our intellectual property  among them  registering trademarks and copyrights  patenting inventions  implementing procedures that afford trade secret status and protection to our proprietary information  such as entering into third party non disclosure and intellectual property assignment agreements  and maintaining our intellectual property by entering into licenses that grant only limited rights to third parties 
we may be required to spend significant resources to protect  monitor and police our trade secrets  proprietary know how trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
despite our 
table of contents efforts to protect our intellectual property  third parties or licensees may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property 
the confidentiality agreements that are designed to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how could be breached  or our trade secrets and proprietary know how might otherwise become known by others 
we may not have adequate remedies for infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights or for breach of our confidentiality agreements 
the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and ability to compete 
we may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property on favorable terms 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products by our harland clarke segment bearing third party trademarks or designs pursuant to royalty bearing licenses 
typically  these licenses are for a term of between two and three years  and some licenses may be terminated at the licensor s option upon a change of control 
there can be no guarantee that such licenses will be renewed or will continue to be available to us on terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably 
third parties may claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future 
in particular  there has been a substantial increase in the issuance of patents for internet related systems and business methods  which may have broad implications for participants in technology and service sectors 
claims for infringement of these patents are increasingly becoming a subject of litigation 
because patent application information may not always be readily available  there is also a risk that we could adopt a technology without knowledge of a pending patent application  which technology would infringe a third party patent once that patent is issued 
responding to these infringement claims may require us to enter into royalty bearing license agreements  to stop selling or to redesign affected products  services and technologies  to pay damages  and or to satisfy indemnification commitments under agreements with our licensees 
in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged by third parties  we could be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition 
future litigation relating to infringement claims could also result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of management resources 
adverse determinations in any litigation or proceeding could also subject us to significant liabilities and could prevent us from using some of our products  services or technologies 
we are dependent upon third party providers for significant information technology needs  and an interruption of services from these providers could materially and adversely affect our operations 
we have entered into agreements with third party providers for the licensing of certain software and the provision of information technology services  including software development and support services  and personal computer  telecommunications  network server and help desk services 
in the event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate information technology services or terminates a license or service  we would be adversely affected 
although we believe that information technology services and substantially equivalent software and services are available from numerous sources  a failure to perform or a termination by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply and we may not be able to find such an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals  many of whom would be difficult to replace  and the loss or interruption of their services could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is largely driven by the personal relationships of our senior management teams 
despite executing employment agreements with certain members of our senior management teams  these individuals may discontinue service with us and we may not be able to find individuals to replace them at the same cost  or at all 
we have not obtained key person insurance for any member of our senior management teams 
the 
table of contents loss or interruption of the services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainty with respect to future acquisitions  and unsuitable or unsuccessful acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we have acquired complementary businesses in the past  and we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether future acquisitions  even if completed  will be successful 
future acquisitions by us could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities  debt or amortization expenses relating to intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the success of any past or future acquisition will depend upon our ability to integrate effectively the acquired businesses 
we also cannot predict whether any acquired products  technology or business will contribute to our revenues or earnings to any material extent or whether cost savings and synergies we expect at the time of an acquisition can be realized once the acquisition has been completed 
furthermore  if we incur additional indebtedness to finance an acquisition  we cannot predict whether the acquired business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service that additional indebtedness 
unsuitable or unsuccessful acquisitions could therefore have a material and adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is exposed to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase of percentage point in the variable component of interest rates applicable to floating rate debt outstanding as of december  would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million per year including the effect of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  adverse interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on the success of our research and development and the failure to develop new and improved products could adversely affect our business 
we have in the past made  and intend to continue in the future to make  investments in research and development in order to enable us to identify and develop new products 
the development process for new products can be lengthy 
despite investments in this area  our research and development may not result in the discovery or successful development of new products 
the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate and properly identify our customers needs and industry trends  price our products competitively  innovate  develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner  obtain necessary regulatory approvals  differentiate our products from competitors products  and use our research and development budget efficiently 
the continuous introduction of new products is important to our growth 
our financial condition could deteriorate if we cannot timely and cost effectively develop and commercialize new products 
we may be subject to sales and other taxes  which could have adverse effects on our business 
in accordance with current federal  state and local tax laws  and the constitutional limitations thereon  we currently collect sales  use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where we have a physical 
table of contents presence 
one or more state or local jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out of state companies which engage in remote or online commerce 
several states in the united states have taken various initiatives to prompt retailers to collect local and state sales taxes on purchases made over the internet 
furthermore  tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change 
in addition  any new operations of these businesses in states where they do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by these businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws 
if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes beyond our current practices  it could have a material  adverse affect on our business 
we may be subject to environmental risks  and liabilities for environmental compliance or cleanup could have a material  adverse effect on our profitability 
our operations are subject to many existing and proposed federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of human health and the environment  the violation of which can result in substantial costs and liabilities  including material civil and criminal fines and penalties 
such requirements include those pertaining to air emissions  wastewater discharges  occupational safety and health  the generation  handling  treatment  remediation  use  storage  transport  release  and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes 
under certain of these laws and regulations  such as the federal superfund statute  the obligation to investigate and remediate contamination at a facility may be imposed on current and former owners or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal 
in addition  environmental laws and regulations  and interpretation or enforcement thereof  are constantly evolving and any such changes could affect the business  financial condition or results of operations 
enforcement of these laws and regulations may require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup 
the operations of our harland clarke segment use hazardous materials in the printing process and generate wastewater and air emissions 
some of our historic check and form printing operations at current and former facilities used hazardous materials in greater quantities 
in some instances  we have sold these facilities and agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities 
we may also be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations for environmental conditions at our current or former facilities or in connection with the disposal of waste generated at these facilities 
although we are not aware of any fact or circumstance that would require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup  if environmental liabilities are discovered at our current or former facilities or at locations where our wastes were disposed  we could be required to spend material amounts for environmental compliance or cleanup 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any environmental site due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by us 
our principal stockholder has significant influence over us 
holdings is a corporation wholly owned by mr 
ronald o 
perelman 
mr 
perelman  directly and through holdings  beneficially owned  as of december   approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  two of our directors  as well as the senior executives of m f worldwide  are affiliated with holdings 
as a result  holdings and its sole stockholder possess significant influence over our business decisions 

table of contents risks related to our harland clarke segment the paper check industry overall is a mature industry and check usage is declining 
our business will be harmed if check usage declines faster than expected 
check and related products and services  including delivery services  account for most of our revenues 
the check industry overall is a mature industry 
the number of checks written in the united states has declined in recent years  and we believe that it will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  smart cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  wire transfers  electronic  home banking applications  internet based payment services and other bill paying services 
the actual rate and extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve consumer acceptance and replace checks  whether as a result of legislative developments  personal preference or otherwise  cannot be predicted with certainty and could decline at a more rapid rate 
changes in technology or the widespread adoption of current technologies may also make alternative payment methods more popular 
an increase in the use of any of these alternative payment methods could have a material adverse effect on the demand for checks and a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
in recent quarters  harland clarke had experienced check unit declines at a higher rate than in the past  as evidenced by recent period over period declines in harland clarke revenue 
harland clarke is unable to determine at this time whether these higher rates of decline are attributable to recent economic and financial market difficulties  the depth and length of the economic recession  higher unemployment  decreased openings of checking accounts  changing business strategies of our financial institution clients  decreased consumer spending and or a further acceleration in the use of alternative non cash payments 
harland clarke expects that check unit volume will continue to decline at rates that are higher than it had previously experienced in recent years  resulting in a corresponding decrease in check revenues and depending on the nature and relative magnitude of the causes for the decreases  such decreases may not be mitigated when overall economic conditions improve 
harland clarke is focused on growing its non check related products and services  including marketing services  and optimizing its existing catalog of offerings to better serve its clients  as well as managing its costs  overhead and facilities to reflect the decline in check unit volumes 
harland clarke does not believe that revenues from non check related products and services will fully offset revenue declines from declining check unit volumes 
in the future  harland clarke may not be able to mitigate the revenue declines from declining check unit volumes through cost management  which could negatively affect harland clarke s margins 
consolidation among financial institutions may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and our ability to sell our products and may therefore result in lower revenues and profitability 
mergers  acquisitions and personnel changes at financial institutions  as well as failures or liquidations of such financial institutions  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   financial institutions accounted for approximately of revenues for our harland clarke segment 
in recent years  the number of financial institutions has declined due to consolidation 
consolidation among financial institutions could cause us to lose current and potential clients as such clients are  for example  acquired by financial institutions with pre existing relationships with other providers 
the increase in general negotiating strength possessed by such consolidated entities also presents a risk that new and or renewed contracts with these institutions may not be secured on terms as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients 
consolidation among or failure of financial institutions could therefore decrease our revenues and profitability 
we are dependent on a few large clients  and adverse changes in our relationships with these highly concentrated clients may adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
the majority of sales from our harland clarke segment has been  and very likely will continue to be  concentrated among a small group of clients 
for the year ended december   the top clients of our harland clarke segment represented approximately of its revenues  with sales to bank of america representing a significant portion of revenues 
a number of contracts with harland clarke segment clients may be terminated by the client for convenience upon written notice or for cause 
a significant decrease or 
table of contents interruption in business from any of our harland clarke segment significant clients  or the termination of our contracts with any of our most significant clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our financial results can also be adversely affected by the business practices and actions of our large clients in a number of ways  including timing  size and mix of product orders and supply chain management 
several contracts with our significant clients expire over the next several years 
we may not be able to renew them on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the loss of one or more of these clients or a shift in the demand by  distribution methods of  pricing to  or terms of sale to  one or more of these clients could materially adversely affect us 
the write off of any significant receivable due from delays in payment or return of products by any of our significant clients could also adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
we face intense competition and pricing pressures in certain areas of our business  which could result in lower revenues  higher costs and lower profitability 
the check printing industry is intensely competitive 
in addition to competition from alternative payment methods  we also face considerable competition from other check printers and other similar providers of printed products 
the principal factors on which we compete are service  convenience  quality  product range and price 
we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors  which could result in lower revenues  higher costs and lower profitability 
interruptions or adverse changes in our vendor or supplier relationships or delivery services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have strong relationships with many of the country s largest paper mills and ink suppliers 
these relationships afford us certain purchasing advantages  including stable supply and favorable pricing arrangements 
our supplier arrangements are by purchase order and terminable at will at the option of either party 
while we have been able to obtain sufficient paper supplies during recent paper shortages and otherwise  in part through purchases from foreign suppliers  we are subject to the risk that we will be unable to purchase sufficient quantities of paper to meet our production requirements during times of tight supply 
an interruption in our relationship with service providers for our digital printers could compromise our ability to fulfill pending orders for checks and related products 
in addition  disruptions in the credit and other financial markets could  among other things  impair the financial condition of suppliers of the company  thereby increasing the risk of supplier performance 
any interruption in supplies or service from these or other vendors or suppliers or delivery services could result in a disruption to our business if we are unable to readily find alternative service providers at comparable rates 
increased production and delivery costs  such as fluctuations in paper costs  could materially adversely affect our profitability 
increases in production costs such as paper and labor could adversely affect our profitability  our business  our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the principal raw material used by our harland clarke segment is paper 
rising inflation may cause our material and delivery costs to rise 
any significant increase in paper prices as a result of a short supply or otherwise would adversely affect our costs 
in addition  disruptions in parcel deliveries or increases in delivery rates  which are often tied to fuel prices  could also increase our costs 
our contracts with clients in our harland clarke segment may contain certain restrictions on our ability to pass on to clients increased production costs or price increases 
in addition  competitive pressures in the check industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products and services 
softness in direct mail response rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
the direct to consumer business of our harland clarke segment has experienced declines in response and retention rates related to direct mail promotional materials 
we believe that these declines are attributable to a number of factors  including the decline in check usage  the overall increase in direct mail solicitations 
table of contents received by our target customers  and the multi box promotional strategies employed by us and our competitors 
to offset these factors  we may have to modify and or increase our marketing efforts  which could result in increased expense 
the profitability of the direct to consumer business of our harland clarke segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates  as well as the consumer response rates generated by such advertising 
suitable advertising media may not be available at a reasonable cost  or available at all 
furthermore  the advertising we utilize may not be effective 
competitive pricing pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect any of these increased costs in the prices of our products 
we may not be able to sustain our current levels of profitability as a result 
risks related to our harland financial solutions and scantron segments if we fail to continually improve our harland financial solutions and scantron products  effectively manage our product offerings and introduce new products and service offerings  our business may suffer 
harland financial solutions and scantron s businesses are affected by technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the businesses of providing technological solutions to financial institutions  educational organizations and other enterprises have been and continue to be intensely competitive  requiring us to continually improve our existing products and create new products while at the same time controlling our costs 
we face intense competition from a number of multi national  international  national  regional and local providers of software and services  some of whom may have greater financial and other resources than we have  greater familiarity with our prospective clients than we do  or the ability to offer more attractive products and services than we do 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance and expand existing harland financial solutions and scantron products and services  make harland financial solutions and scantron products compatible with future and existing operating systems and applications that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace  including current and future versions of windows  unix and ibm iseries  engage in new business initiatives  and develop and introduce new products and new services that satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements  keep pace with technological and regulatory developments  provide client value and are attractive to customers 
we may not successfully anticipate and develop product enhancements or new products and services to adequately address changing technologies and client requirements 
any such products  solutions or services may not be successful or may not generate expected revenues or cash flow  and the business and results of operations of our harland financial solutions and scantron businesses may be materially and adversely affected as a result 
the revenues  cash flows and results of operations of our harland financial solutions segment may be reduced if we need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms on our products and services to meet competitive pressures in the software industry 
providing technological solutions to financial institutions has been and continues to be intensely competitive 
some of our competitors have advantages over harland financial solutions due to their significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  larger installed client base  and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
in response to competition  harland financial solutions has been required in the past  and may be required in the future  to furnish additional discounts to clients  otherwise modify pricing practices or offer more favorable payment terms or more favorable contractual implementation terms 
these developments have and may increasingly negatively impact the revenues  cash flows and results of operations of the harland financial solutions business 

table of contents consolidation among financial institutions may adversely affect our relationships with harland financial solutions clients and our ability to sell our products and may therefore result in lower revenues and profitability 
mergers  acquisitions and personnel changes at financial institutions  as well as failures or liquidations of such financial institutions  may adversely affect our harland financial solutions business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   financial institutions accounted for substantially all of our harland financial solutions segment revenues 
in recent years  the number of financial institutions has declined due to consolidation 
consolidation among financial institutions could cause us to lose current and potential clients as such clients are  for example  acquired by financial institutions with relationships with other providers 
the increase in general negotiating strength possessed by such consolidated entities also presents a risk that new and or renewed contracts with these institutions may not be secured on terms as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients 
consolidation among or failure of financial institutions could therefore decrease our revenues and profitability 
downturns in general economic and industry conditions  enhanced regulatory burdens and reductions in information technology budgets could cause decreases in demand for our software and related services which could negatively affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
our revenues  cash flows and results of operations depend on the overall demand for our products  software and related services 
economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which we do business and enhanced regulatory burdens  including through increased fees and assessments charged to financial institutions by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and national credit union administration ncua or due to newly proposed federal legislation for additional taxes on certain financial institutions  could result in reductions in the information technology budgets for some portion of our clients and potentially longer lead times for acquiring harland financial solutions products and services 
such reductions and longer lead times could result in delays or cancellations of client purchases and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recent financial industry turmoil and the general economic slowdown may adversely affect our financial institution clients ability or willingness to commit financial resources to our products  and spending decisions by these clients may continue to be delayed 
prolonged economic slowdowns may result in clients requiring us to renegotiate existing contracts on less advantageous terms than those currently in place or default on payments due on existing contracts 
as our software offerings increase in number  scope and complexity  our need to prevent any undetected errors and to correct any identified errors may increase our costs  slow the introduction of new products and we may become subject to warranty or product liability claims which could be costly to resolve and result in negative publicity 
although our harland financial solutions and scantron businesses test each of their new products and product enhancement releases and evaluate and test the products obtained through acquisition before introducing them to customers  significant errors may be found in existing or future releases of our software products  and vulnerability to cyber attacks may arise  with the possible result that significant resources and expenditures may be required in order to correct such errors or otherwise satisfy client demands 
in addition  defects in our products or difficulty integrating our products with our clients systems could result in delayed or lost revenues  warranty or other claims against us by clients or third parties  adverse client reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services or reduced acceptance of our products and services in the marketplace  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
errors  defects or other performance problems of our products could result in harm or damage to our clients and expose us to liability  which may adversely affect our business and operating results 
because our clients may use our products for mission critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems may cause financial or other damages to our clients and result in claims for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for such errors  defects or other performance problems

the terms of our contracts with our clients are generally designed to limit our liability for errors  defects or other performance problems and damages relating to such errors  defects or other performance problems  but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims 
our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims 
our current liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms and insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceed available insurance coverage  or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  even if we succeed in the litigation  we are likely to incur additional costs and our management s attention might be diverted from our normal operations 
failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified information technology professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business of delivering professional information technology services is labor intensive  and  accordingly  our success depends upon our ability to attract  develop  motivate  retain and effectively utilize highly skilled information technology professionals 
we believe that there is a growing shortage of  and significant competition for  information technology professionals in the united states who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver our services  and that such information technology professionals are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we believe that  as a result of these factors  we operate within an industry that experiences a significant rate of annual turnover of information technology personnel 
our business plans are based on hiring and training a significant number of additional information technology professionals each year to meet anticipated turnover and increased staffing needs 
our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and to obtain new business depends  in large part  on our ability to hire and retain qualified information technology professionals 
we may not be able to recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified information technology professionals  and we may not be successful in retaining current or future employees 
increased hiring by technology companies and increasing worldwide competition for skilled technology professionals may lead to a shortage in the availability of qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate and hire 
failure to hire and train or retain qualified information technology professionals in sufficient numbers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts 
developing and localizing software is expensive  and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle 
our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position  but future revenues from these investments are not fully predictable 
therefore  we may not realize any benefits from our research and development efforts in a timely fashion or at all 
our harland financial solutions segment provides services to clients that are subject to government regulations that could constrain its operations 
the financial services sector is subject to various federal and state regulations and oversight 
as a supplier of services to financial institutions  certain harland financial solutions operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency  the fdic and the ncua  among other agencies 
these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate  and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 
current laws and regulations may be amended in the future or interpreted by regulators in a manner which could negatively impact our current harland financial solutions operations or limit its future growth 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully develop new products and services for our scantron segment  and those products and services may not receive widespread acceptance 
as a result  the business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition of scantron could be materially and adversely affected 
the data collection and educational testing industry has also changed significantly during recent years due to technological advances and regulatory changes  and we must successfully develop new products and solutions in our scantron segment to respond to those changes 
scantron must continue to keep pace with changes in testing and data collection technology and the needs of its clients 
the development of new testing methods and technologies depends on the timing and costs of the development effort  product performance  functionality  customer acceptance  adoption rates and competition  all of which could have a negative impact on our business 
if we are not able to adopt new electronic data collection solutions at a rate that keeps pace with other technological advances  the business  business prospects  results of operations and financial condition of scantron could be materially and adversely affected 
budget deficits may reduce funding available for scantron products and services and have a negative impact on our revenue 
our scantron segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from public schools and colleges  which are heavily dependent on local  state and federal governments for financial support 
government budget deficits  including deficits arising from the current economic slowdown  may have a negative effect on the availability of funding for scantron products 
budget deficits experienced by schools or colleges may also cause those institutions to react negatively to future price increases for scantron products 
if budget deficits significantly reduce funding available for scantron products and services  our revenue could be adversely affected 
if we are not able to obtain paper and other supplies at acceptable quantities and prices  our revenue could be adversely affected 
our scantron segment purchases a majority of its paper from one supplier 
scantron purchases scanner components from equipment manufacturers  supply firms and others 
scantron may not be able to purchase those supplies in adequate quantities or at acceptable prices 
rising inflation will also cause scantron s material and delivery costs to rise 
if scantron is forced to obtain paper and other supplies at higher prices or lower quantities  our profitability could be adversely affected 
risks related to mafco worldwide s business and industry mafco worldwide s business is heavily dependent on sales to the worldwide tobacco industry  and negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  approximately of mafco worldwide s licorice sales and of the company s consolidated net revenues were to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco 
negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry  such as those described below  could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
consumption of tobacco products worldwide has declined steadily for years 
prior to  mafco worldwide s licorice extract sales to the worldwide tobacco industry experienced regular declines annually 
these declines were primarily the result of a worldwide decline in the consumption of american blend cigarettes  which typically contain higher concentrations of licorice extract 
the annual cigarette consumption decline was over on a worldwide basis for several years 
during  mafco worldwide experienced a decline in its sales of licorice extract to the worldwide tobacco industry in excess of the rate of consumption decline of american blend cigarettes 
this accelerated rate of decline was due in part to a shift in the strategy of worldwide cigarette manufacturers  which placed a greater emphasis on product changes and cost reductions to offer more value positioned products to consumers 

table of contents changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  an increased emphasis on the public health aspects of tobacco product consumption  increases in excise and other taxes on tobacco products and a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to this worldwide decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and taxation of tobacco products 
restrictive tobacco legislation has also included restrictions on where and how tobacco may be sold and used  imposition of warning labels and other graphic packaging images and  recently  restrictions on tobacco product ingredients 
other tobacco products contain licorice extract  including chewing tobacco and moist snuff  and consumption of these products is concentrated primarily in the united states 
domestic consumption of chewing tobacco products has declined by approximately per year over the past five years 
moist snuff consumption has increased approximately per year over the past five years due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking and smokeless tobacco 
the tobacco industry has been subject to increased governmental taxation and regulation and in recent years has been subject to substantial litigation 
these trends are likely to continue and it is likely that these trends will negatively affect tobacco product consumption and tobacco product manufacturers 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the united states at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
in  the united states government enacted the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act  which provides greater regulatory oversight for the manufacture of tobacco products  including the ability to regulate tobacco product additives 
the united states food drug administration now has the power to limit the type or quantity of additives that may be used in the manufacture of tobacco products in the united states 
other governments  for example canada  have prohibited the use of certain ingredients  and public health authorities  including the european commission  are considering further prohibitions 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
some of this litigation has been settled through the payment of substantial amounts to various state governments  and united states cigarette companies significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup a portion of the settlement cost 
cigarette companies have also sought to offset the cost of these payments by changing product formulations and introducing value priced products with different ingredient formulations 
there may be an increase in health related litigation against the tobacco industry  and it is possible that mafco worldwide  as a supplier to the tobacco industry  may become a party to such litigation 
this litigation  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign governments have increased such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
in february  the united states government enacted the state children s health insurance program schip 
the health programs in this legislation are being funded by an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes to per pack from the previous per pack and by significant increases in federal taxes on cigars and other tobacco products 
other proposals to increase taxes on tobacco products are also regularly introduced in the united states and foreign countries 
additional taxes may lead to an accelerated decline in tobacco product sales 
mafco worldwide is unable to predict whether there will be additional price or tax increases for tobacco products or the size of any such increases  or the effect of other developments in tobacco regulation or litigation or consumer attitudes on further declines in the consumption of either tobacco products containing licorice extract or on sales of licorice extract to the tobacco industry 
further material declines in sales to the tobacco industry are likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of mafco worldwide 

table of contents changes in consumer preferences could decrease mafco worldwide s revenues and cash flow 
mafco worldwide is subject to the risks of evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health related concerns 
a portion of mafco worldwide s revenues are derived from the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners 
to the extent that consumer preferences shift away from licorice flavored candy  operating results relating to the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a portion of mafco worldwide s revenues are derived from the sale of licorice derivatives to food processors for use as flavoring or masking agents  including mafco worldwide s magnasweet brand flavor enhancer  which is used in various brands of chewing gum  lip balm  energy bars  non carbonated beverages  chewable vitamins  aspirin  and other products and is identified in the united states as a natural flavor 
to the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that use licorice derivatives  operating results relating to the sale of licorice derivatives could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in regulations regarding licorice confection may reduce mafco worldwide s sales and profits 
licorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in the european union 
during  the european union issued regulations that imposed limitations on certain chemical substances commonly found in licorice root and licorice extracts 
these regulations are effective beginning july and could potentially result in decreased demand for mafco worldwide s products from its confectionery customers in the european union in the future 
sales of licorice extracts to confectionary customers in the european union totaled million for the year ended december  competition and consolidation in the specialty sweetener industry may reduce mafco worldwide s sales and profit margins 
the non nutritive sweetener industry is a highly competitive industry 
mafco worldwide competes with companies that have greater capital resources  facilities and diversity of product lines 
increased competition as to mafco worldwide s products could result in decreased demand for its products  reduced volumes and or prices  each of which would reduce mafco worldwide s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
mafco worldwide s margins are also under pressure from consolidation in the retail food industry in many regions of the world 
in the united states  mafco worldwide s customers may experience a shift in the channels where consumers purchase their products from the higher margin retail to the lower margin club and mass merchandisers 
such consolidation may significantly increase mafco worldwide s customers costs of doing business and may further result in lower sales of its products and or lower margins on sales 
any failure to comply with the many laws applicable to mafco worldwide s business may result in significant fines and penalties 
mafco worldwide s facilities and products are subject to laws and regulations administered by the federal food and drug administration  and other federal  state  local  and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing  packaging  storage  distribution  advertising  labeling  quality  and safety of food products 
mafco worldwide s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief  civil remedies  including fines  injunctions and recalls of mafco worldwide s products 
mafco worldwide s operations are also subject to regulations administered by the environmental protection agency and other state  local and foreign governmental agencies 
failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences  including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 
in addition to these possible fines and penalties  changes in laws and regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions  including changes in food and drug laws  accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations and environmental laws could have a significant adverse effect on mafco worldwide s results of operations 

table of contents mafco worldwide is heavily dependent on certain of its customers for a significant percentage of its net revenues 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  six of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of its net revenues or of the company s consolidated net revenues 
if any of mafco worldwide s significant customers were to stop purchasing licorice products from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of mafco worldwide s employees belong to labor unions  and strikes  work stoppages and other labor disturbances could adversely affect mafco worldwide s operations and could cause its costs to increase 
mafco worldwide is a party to a collective bargaining agreement with respect to its employees at the camden  new jersey facility 
this agreement expires in may disputes with regard to the terms of this agreement or mafco worldwide s potential inability to negotiate an acceptable contract upon expiration of the existing contract could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  mafco worldwide could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs 
in addition  mafco worldwide s collective bargaining agreements and labor laws may impair its ability to reduce labor costs by streamlining existing manufacturing facilities and in restructuring its business because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions 
changes in mafco worldwide s relationships with its suppliers could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
mafco worldwide is dependent on its relationships with suppliers of licorice root 
licorice is derived from the roots of the licorice plant  a shrub like leguminous plant that is indigenous to the middle east and central asia 
most of the licorice root mafco worldwide purchases originates in afghanistan  the peoples republic of china  pakistan  iraq  azerbaijan  uzbekistan  turkmenistan and turkey 
during  one of mafco worldwide s suppliers of licorice root supplied approximately of its total root purchases 
mafco worldwide also purchases licorice extracts and licorice derivatives 
if any material licorice root supplier or any other material supplier modifies its relationship with mafco worldwide  such a loss  reduction or modification could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in costs of licorice root and intermediary licorice extract could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the price of licorice root and intermediary licorice extracts increased significantly during and prior to this  the price of licorice root and intermediary licorice extract had been relatively stable for several years 
the price of licorice root and intermediary licorice extract are affected by many factors  including monetary fluctuations and economic  political and weather conditions in countries where mafco worldwide s suppliers are located 
although mafco worldwide often enters into purchase contracts for these products  significant or prolonged increases in the prices of licorice root and intermediary licorice extract could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide is subject to risks associated with economic  climatic or political instability in countries in which mafco worldwide sources licorice root and intermediary licorice extract 
most of the licorice root mafco worldwide processes originates in afghanistan  the people s republic of china  pakistan  iraq  azerbaijan  uzbekistan  turkmenistan and turkey 
producers of intermediary licorice extract are located primarily in the people s republic of china  iraq and central asia 
mafco worldwide s wholly owned derivative manufacturing facility  the primary source of mafco worldwide s licorice derivatives  is located in the people s republic of china 
these countries and regions have  from time to time  been 
table of contents subject to political instability  corruption and violence 
economic  climatic or political instability in these countries and regions could result in reduced supply  material shipping delays  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  customs duties  tariffs and import or export quotas  embargos  sanctions  significant raw material price increases or exposure to liability under the foreign corrupt practices act and could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  military action in iraq and afghanistan  increasing military tension involving pakistan  as well as continuing threats of terrorist attacks and unrest  have caused instability in the world s financial and commercial markets and have significantly increased political and economic instability in some of the countries and regions from which mafco worldwide s raw materials originate 
acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around these countries and regions could adversely affect mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition in ways the company cannot predict at this time 
mafco worldwide s business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
mafco worldwide s international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
approximately of mafco worldwide s sales were from international operations in mafco worldwide s primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the united states dollar versus the euro and the united states dollar versus the chinese yuan 
changes in currency exchange rates could also affect the relative prices at which mafco worldwide and its foreign competitors sell products in the same market 
adverse foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide is also exposed to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase of percentage point in the variable component of interest rates applicable to floating rate debt outstanding as of december  would have resulted in an increase in its annual interest expense of approximately million 
adverse interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any failure to maintain the quality of mafco worldwide s manufacturing processes or raw materials could harm its operating results 
the manufacture of mafco worldwide s products is a multi stage process that requires the use of high quality materials and manufacturing technologies 
in spite of stringent quality controls  weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of a product in a lot to be defective 
if mafco worldwide were not able to maintain its manufacturing processes or to maintain stringent quality controls  or if contamination problems arise  mafco worldwide s operating results would be harmed 
mafco worldwide s business is subject to risks related to weather  disease and pests that could adversely affect its business 
licorice production is subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
extreme weather conditions  disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of licorice produced 
mafco worldwide generally maintains a substantial inventory of licorice root to mitigate against the risks of any temporary supply interruption  including an interruption due to agricultural factors  but a sustained interruption could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide is subject to transportation risks 
an extended interruption in mafco worldwide s ability to ship or distribute products could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company believes mafco worldwide is adequately insured  the company cannot be sure that mafco worldwide would be able to transport its products by alternative means if it were to experience an interruption due to strike  natural disasters or otherwise  in a timely and cost effective manner 

table of contents mafco worldwide s failure to accurately forecast and manage inventory could result in an unexpected shortfall of its products which could harm its business 
mafco worldwide monitors its inventory levels based on its own projections of future demand 
because of the length of time necessary to harvest licorice root and produce licorice products  mafco worldwide must make production decisions well in advance of sales 
an inaccurate forecast of demand can result in the unavailability of licorice products in high demand 
this unavailability may depress sales volumes and adversely affect customer relationships 
risks relating to the company s contingent claims the failure of pneumo abex s claims managers  guarantor  indemnitors and insurers to pay their obligations timely and substantially in full could have a material adverse effect on the company 
pneumo abex has no operating business or regular source of revenue and is therefore dependent on its claims managers  guarantor  indemnitors and insurers for payment of obligations arising out of the defense and resolution of third party claims asserted against it 
based upon these third parties active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery  the company believes that the likelihood of the covering parties failing to satisfy the obligations associated with these matters is remote  although there can be no assurance 
even if there should be a material failure to satisfy these obligations  there should be no material effect on the company as a whole because pneumo abex is an immaterial part of the overall company 
in that circumstance  however  third party claimants may attempt to seek redress from the other units of the company 
while such attempts should fail  the company can give no assurance in that regard 
risks relating to the company s investments negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investments in auction rate securities 
the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities 
the company s investments included million of auction rate securities ars held by m f worldwide as of december  these investments are classified as available for sale and are reported as non current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at market value 
these types of ars investments are backed by student loans 
the company does not own any other type of ars investments 
the ars held by the company are securities with long term maturities ranging between and years for which the interest rates reset every or days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand at auction also known as failure to settle for ars investments backed by student loans  including auctions for ars investments held by m f worldwide 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
the company believes that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing its ars investments has not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these ars investments 
in the event the company needs to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  it will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the company does not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future

data management designed  manufactured and serviced scannable data collection products  including printed forms  scanning equipment and related software  and provided survey consulting and tracking services  including medical device tracking  as well as field maintenance services to corporate and governmental clients 
the company financed the data management acquisition and related fees and expenses with cash on hand at harland clarke holdings

harland clarke believes the number of checks printed is driven by the number of checks written  the number of new checking accounts opened and reorders reflecting changes in consumers personal situations  such as name or address changes 
in recent quarters  harland clarke had experienced check unit declines at a higher rate than in the past  as evidenced by recent period over period declines in harland clarke revenue which are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report 
harland clarke is unable to determine at this time whether these higher rates of decline are attributable to recent economic and financial market difficulties  the depth and length of the economic recession  higher unemployment  decreased openings of checking accounts  changing business strategies of our financial institution clients  decreased consumer spending and or a further acceleration in the use of alternative non cash payments 
harland clarke expects that check unit volume will continue to decline at rates that are higher than it had previously experienced in recent years  resulting in a corresponding decrease in check revenues and depending on the nature and relative magnitude of the causes for the decreases  such decreases may not be mitigated when overall economic conditions improve 
harland clarke is focused on growing its non check related products and services  including marketing services  and optimizing its existing catalog of offerings to better serve its clients  as well as managing its costs  overhead 
table of contents and facilities to reflect the decline in check unit volumes 
harland clarke does not believe that revenues from non check related products and services will fully offset revenue declines from declining check unit volumes 
in the future  harland clarke may not be able to mitigate the revenue declines from declining check unit volumes through cost management  which could negatively affect harland clarke s margins 
harland clarke s primary competition comes from alternative payment methods such as debit cards  credit cards  ach  and other electronic and online payment options 
harland clarke also competes with large providers that offer a wide variety of products and services including deluxe corporation  harte hanks  inc  and rr donnelly sons company 
there are also many other competitors that specialize in providing one or more of the products and services harland clarke offers to its clients 
harland clarke competes on the basis of service  convenience  quality  product range and price 
the harland clarke segment s operating results are also affected by consumer confidence and employment 
consumer confidence directly correlates with consumer spending  while employment also affects revenues through the number of new checking accounts being opened 
the harland clarke segment s operating results may be negatively affected by slow or negative growth of  or downturns in  the united states economy 
business confidence affects a portion of the harland clarke segment 
in addition  if harland clarke s financial institution customers fail or merge with other financial institutions  harland clarke may lose any or all revenue from such financial institutions and or experience further pricing pressure  which would negatively affect harland clarke s operating results 
harland financial solutions harland financial solutions operating results are affected by the overall demand for our products  software and related services which is based upon the technology budgets of our clients and prospects 
economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which we do business and enhanced regulatory burdens  including through increased fees and assessments charged to financial institutions by the fdic and ncua or due to newly proposed federal legislation for additional taxes on certain financial institutions  could result in reductions in the information technology budgets for some portion of our clients and potentially longer lead times for acquiring harland financial solutions products and services 
in addition  if harland financial solutions financial institution customers fail or merge with other financial institutions  harland financial solutions may lose any or all revenue from such financial institutions and or experience further pricing pressure  which would negatively affect harland financial solutions operating results 
harland financial solutions business is affected by technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the business of providing technological solutions to financial institutions and other enterprises requires that we continually improve our existing products and create new products while at the same time controlling our costs to remain price competitive 
providing technological solutions to financial institutions is highly competitive and fragmented 
harland financial solutions competes with several large and diversified financial technology providers  including  among others  fidelity national information services  inc  fiserv  inc  jack henry associates  inc  open solutions inc  computer services inc  and many regional providers 
many multi national and international providers of technological solutions to financial institutions also compete with harland financial solutions both domestically and internationally  including temenos group ag  misys plc  infosys technologies limited  tata consultancy and bisys group  inc there are also many other competitors that offer one or more specialized products or services that compete with harland financial solutions 
management believes that competitive factors influencing buying decisions include product features and functionality  client support  price and vendor financial stability 
scantron while the number of tests given annually in k and higher education continues to grow  the demand for optical mark reader paper based testing has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
changes in educational funding can affect the rate at which schools adopt new technology thus slowing the decline for paper based testing but also slowing the demand for scantron s on line testing products 
educational funding 
table of contents changes may also reduce the rate of consumption of scantron s forms and purchase of additional hardware to process these forms 
scantron s education based customers may turn to lower cost solutions for paper based forms and hardware in furtherance of addressing their budget needs 
a weak economy in the united states may negatively affect education budgets and spending  which would have an adverse impact on scantron s operating results 
data collection is also experiencing a conversion to non paper based methods of collection 
scantron believes this trend will also continue as the availability of these alternative technologies becomes more widespread 
while scantron s non paper data collection business could benefit from this trend  scantron s paper based data collection business could be negatively affected by this trend 
changes in the overall economy can affect the demand for data collection to the extent that scantron s customers adjust their research or testing expenditures 
mafco worldwide sales of licorice extract to the worldwide tobacco industry are a material part of the overall sales of mafco worldwide  so developments and trends within the tobacco industry may have a material effect on its operations 
prior to  mafco worldwide s licorice extract sales to the worldwide tobacco industry experienced regular declines annually 
these declines were primarily the result of a worldwide decline in the consumption of american blend cigarettes  which typically contain higher concentrations of licorice extract 
the annual cigarette consumption decline was over on a worldwide basis for several years 
during  mafco worldwide experienced a decline in its sales of licorice extract to the worldwide tobacco industry in excess of the rate of consumption decline of american blend cigarettes 
this accelerated rate of decline was due in part to a shift in the strategy of worldwide cigarette manufacturers  which placed a greater emphasis on product changes and cost reductions to offer more value positioned products to consumers 
changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  an increased emphasis on the public health aspects of tobacco product consumption  increases in excise and other taxes on tobacco products and a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to this worldwide decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and taxation of tobacco products 
restrictive tobacco legislation has also included restrictions on where and how tobacco may be sold and used  imposition of warning labels and other graphic packaging images and  recently  restrictions on tobacco product ingredients 
other tobacco products contain licorice extract  including chewing tobacco and moist snuff  and consumption of these products is concentrated primarily in the united states 
domestic consumption of chewing tobacco products has declined by approximately per year over the past five years 
moist snuff consumption has increased approximately per year over the past five years due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking and smokeless tobacco 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the united states at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
in  the united states government enacted the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act  which provides greater regulatory oversight for the manufacture of tobacco products  including the ability to regulate tobacco product additives 
the united states food drug administration now has the power to limit the type or quantity of additives that may be used in the manufacture of tobacco products in the united states 
other governments  for example canada  have prohibited the use of certain ingredients  and public health authorities  including the european commission  are considering further prohibitions 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
some of this litigation has been settled through the payment of substantial amounts to various state governments  and united states cigarette companies significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup a portion of the settlement cost 
cigarette companies have also sought to offset the cost of these payments by changing product formulations 
table of contents and introducing new products with decreased ingredient costs 
there may be an increase in health related litigation against the tobacco industry  and it is possible that mafco worldwide  as a supplier to the tobacco industry  may become a party to such litigation 
this litigation  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign governments have increased such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
in february  the united states government enacted the state children s health insurance program schip 
the health programs in this legislation are being funded by an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes to per pack from the previous per pack and by significant increases in federal taxes on cigars and other tobacco products 
other proposals to increase taxes on tobacco products are also regularly introduced in the united states and foreign countries 
additional taxes may lead to an accelerated decline in tobacco product sales 
mafco worldwide is unable to predict whether there will be additional price or tax increases for tobacco products or the size of any such increases  or the effect of other developments in tobacco regulation or litigation or consumer attitudes on further declines in the consumption of either tobacco products containing licorice extract or on sales of licorice extract to the tobacco industry 
further material declines in sales to the tobacco industry are likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of mafco worldwide 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  pensions and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  as well as other assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition the company considers its revenue recognition policy as critical to its reported results of operations primarily in its harland financial solutions and scantron segments 
revenue recognition requires judgment  including  amongst other things  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements  and whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of the company s products and services over time 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in the company s ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially affect the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company s software license agreements include multiple products and services or elements 
none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 
the accounting guidance generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated proportionally to each element based on vsoe of fair value 
fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately 
in the event that the company determines that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  a 
table of contents residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 
implementation services are generally for installation  training  implementation and configuration 
these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software 
vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately 
generally revenue is recognized when services are completed 
on implementations for outsourced data processing services  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the outsourcing arrangement 
on certain larger implementations  revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation 
milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on labor hours 
estimates of efforts to complete a project are used in the percentage of completion calculation 
due to uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from these estimates 
maintenance fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is usually twelve months 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 
outsourced data processing services and other transaction processing services are recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 
the company recognizes product and service revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  products have been shipped and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer and an economic exchange has taken place 
revenues are recorded net of any applicable discounts  contract acquisition payments amortization  accrued incentives and allowances for sales returns 
deferred revenues represent amounts billed to the customer in excess of amounts earned 
title for product sales may pass to customers upon leaving the company s facilities  upon receipt at a specific destination such as a shipping port or upon arrival at the customer s facilities  depending on the terms of the contractual agreements for each customer 
title for product sales to domestic customers typically passes when the product leaves the company s facilities 
title for product sales to international customers typically passes either when the product is delivered to a shipping port or when the product is delivered to the customer s facilities 
revenues for direct response marketing services are recognized from the company s fixed price direct mail and marketing contracts based on the proportional performance method for specific projects 
inventories the majority of the company s inventories consists of licorice raw materials 
licorice raw materials have an indefinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company determines cost by average costing or the first in  first out method 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
income taxes the company estimates its actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 

table of contents long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
significant assumptions requiring judgment are required to determine future cash flows  including but not limited to the estimated remaining useful life of the asset  future revenue streams and future expenditures to maintain the existing service potential of the asset 
the company re evaluates the useful life of these assets at least annually to determine if events and circumstances continue to support their recorded useful lives 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell such assets 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired 
goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units 
in  the company reduced the number of reporting units from six to five as a result of an organizational realignment and the integration of two former reporting units into a single reporting unit 
certain of the company s reporting units are the same as its reportable segments and certain reporting units are one level below the reportable segment  which is at the operating segment level 
the company utilizes both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows 
the discount rate used is the value weighted average of the reporting unit s estimated cost of equity and debt cost of capital derived using  both known and estimated  customary market metrics 
the company performs sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach 
in applying the market approach  valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies  evaluated and adjusted  if necessary  based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies  and applied to the appropriate historical and or projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
the company weights the results of the income and market approaches equally  except where guideline companies are not similar enough to provide a reasonable value using the market approach 
when that occurs  the market approach is weighted less than the income approach 
the company assesses the results of the reporting unit valuations in relation to the value indicated by the company s market capitalization to ensure that the results are reasonable relative to market pricing 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s implied fair value requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of its indefinite lived tradenames and trademarks based on the relief from royalty method 
under the relief from royalty method of the income approach  the value of an intangible 
table of contents asset is determined by quantifying the cost savings a company enjoys by owning  as opposed to licensing  the intangible asset 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar tradenames and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the company measures impairment of mafco worldwide s indefinite lived product formulations based on the excess earnings method of the income approach 
under this methodology  the estimated fair value of the product formulations is determined by the sum of the present values of the projected annual earnings attributable to the product formulations 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates made by management 
the discounted cash flow analyses require various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about sales  operating margins and growth rates are based on the company s budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are evaluated for impairment as discussed above in long lived assets 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows accounting guidance for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and consults with outside experts  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
when evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
see item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  which cover certain current and former company employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the company also sponsors unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that cover certain former salaried and non salaried employees 
one postretirement benefit plan provides health care benefits and the other provides life insurance benefits 
the company consults with outside actuaries who use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on pension plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates and the expected health care cost trend rate to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  higher or lower healthcare inflation rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension and postretirement benefit income expense and asset liability that the company recorded 
derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the company recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in 
table of contents other comprehensive income loss until the underlying debt instrument being hedged is settled or the company determines that the specific hedge accounting criteria are no longer met 
on the date the interest rate derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company links all hedges that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments 
the company links all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions or to liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company also assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if an existing derivative were to become not highly effective as a hedge  the company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge based on total changes in the hedge s cash flows at each payment date as compared to the change in the expected future cash flows on the long term debt 
investments the company has investments classified as available for sale securities  consisting of auction rate debt securities ars collateralized by student loans  united states treasury securities and corporate equity securities which are stated at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses on such investments reflected in other income expense  or as other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investments are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
the fair value of the ars is estimated utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
the analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  as well as forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period 
there is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows and changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of ars in future periods 
if the market value of an investment declines below its cost  the company evaluates whether the decline is temporary  or other than temporary 
the company considers several factors in determining whether a decline is temporary including the length of time market value has been below cost  the magnitude of the decline  financial prospects of the issuer or business and the company s intention to hold the security 
if a decline in market value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary  a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
through the third quarter of  the company recorded changes in fair value on the ars in accumulated other comprehensive loss  except for a cumulative effect adjustment recorded as a decrease to retained earnings of  net of taxes of  during the second quarter of under the amended accounting guidance discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the cumulative effect adjustment represents a reclassification of credit losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold certain of the ars issues and reclassified all unrealized losses on the ars from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings 
accounting guidance see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k regarding the impact of recently issued accounting guidance on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements it has not been the company s practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that incorporate general indemnification 
table of contents language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there has historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications  and the company does not expect any material adverse claims in the future 
the company is not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entity or other third party that is reasonably likely to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in addition  the company has not established any special purpose entity 
asset impairments changes in estimates and assumptions used in the company s financial projections resulting from the factors discussed above for any of the company s business segments could have a material impact on the fair value of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long lived assets in future periods  which may result in material asset impairments  as more fully described in item a  risk factors weak economic conditions and further acceleration of check unit declines may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability and could result in additional impairment charges 
restructuring the company has taken restructuring actions in the past in an effort to achieve manufacturing and contact center efficiencies and other cost savings 
past restructuring actions have related to both acquisitions and ongoing cost reduction initiatives and have included manufacturing plant closures  contact center closures and workforce rationalization 
the company anticipates future restructuring actions  where appropriate  to realize process efficiencies  to continue to align our cost structure with business needs and remain competitive in the marketplace 
the company expects to incur severance and severance related costs  facilities closures costs and other costs such as inventory write offs  training  hiring and travel in connection with future restructuring actions 
consolidated operating results the company has organized its business along four reportable segments together with a corporate group for certain support services 
the company s operations are aligned on the basis of products  services and industry 
management measures and evaluates the reportable segments based on operating income 
in the tables below  dollars are in millions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the operating results for the years ended december  and  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and described below  include the acquired protocol ims  transaction holdings and data management businesses from the respective dates of acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents net revenues year ended december  consolidated net revenues harland clarke segment harland financial solutions segment scantron segment licorice products segment eliminations total net revenues decreased by million  or  to  million in from  million in net revenues from the harland clarke segment decreased by million  or  to  million in from  million in the decrease was primarily due to volume declines from check and related products  which the company believes was partially affected by the economic downturn 
declines in volumes were partially offset by increased revenues per unit 
net revenues from the harland financial solutions segment decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to declines in license  hardware and professional services revenues as well as in mortgage products  partially offset by increases in lending products 
the company believes the declines were partially affected by the economic downturn  which has negatively affected financial institution purchases

mafco worldwide in addition to normal operating cash  working capital requirements and service of indebtedness  mafco worldwide also requires cash to fund capital expenditures  periodically build raw materials inventories and fund administrative and other expenses regarding indemnified liabilities

inventories 
mafco worldwide s licorice raw materials are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
additionally  most of the licorice root mafco worldwide purchases originates in countries and regions that have  from time to time  been subject to political instability 
accordingly  mafco worldwide must periodically build its raw materials supply in order to avoid material shortages or significant raw material price increases 
shortages of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
cash flow risks each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide s ability to meet their respective debt service obligations and reduce their total debt will depend upon their respective ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond their respective control 
each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under their credit facilities in an amount sufficient to repay their debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as of december   harland clarke holdings had million of availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit and mafco worldwide had million of availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit 
the company may also use the revolving credit facilities to fund potential future acquisitions or investments

harland clarke holdings or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of their existing and future indebtedness may limit their ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
mafco worldwide may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
mafco worldwide tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for approximately three years 
at december   mafco worldwide had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material of approximately three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although mafco worldwide has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw materials are obtained  mafco worldwide may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw 
table of contents materials due to these or other instabilities 
if mafco worldwide is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is unable to obtain them in a cost effective manner  mafco worldwide s business will be severely hampered and mafco worldwide will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  six of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues and approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
if any of mafco worldwide s significant customers were to stop purchasing licorice from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of mafco worldwide  which would also create severe liquidity difficulties for mafco worldwide 
non operating contingent claims  indemnification and insurance matters the company s non operating contingent claims are generally associated with its indirect  wholly owned  non operating subsidiary  pneumo abex llc together with its predecessors in interest  pneumo abex 
substantially all of these contingent claims are the financial responsibility of third parties and include various environmental and asbestos related claims 
as a result  the company has not since paid and does not expect to pay on its own behalf material amounts related to these matters 
in  a predecessor of pepsiamericas  inc the original indemnitor sold to pneumo abex various operating businesses  all of which pneumo abex re sold by prior to the sale  those businesses had manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor has ultimate responsibility for all the remaining asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by pneumo abex in december of its friction products division  a subsidiary the friction buyer of cooper industries  inc now cooper industries  llc  the friction guarantor assumed all liability for substantially all asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex after august and not indemnified by the original indemnitor 
following the friction products sale  pneumo abex treated the division as a discontinued operation and stopped including the division s assets and liabilities in its financial statements 
in  mcg intermediate holdings inc mcgi  m f worldwide and two subsidiaries of m f worldwide entered into a transfer agreement the transfer agreement 
under the transfer agreement  pneumo abex transferred to mcgi substantially all of its assets and liabilities other than the assets and liabilities relating to its former abex nwl aerospace division aerospace and certain contingent liabilities and the related assets  including its historical insurance and indemnification arrangements 
the transfer agreement provides for appropriate transfer  indemnification and tax sharing arrangements  in a manner consistent with applicable law and previously existing contractual arrangements  as further explained below 
the transfer agreement also requires mcgi  which currently is an indirect subsidiary of holdings  to undertake certain administrative and funding obligations with respect to certain categories of asbestos related claims and other liabilities  including environmental claims  that pneumo abex did not transfer 
pneumo abex will be obligated to reimburse the amounts so funded only when it receives amounts under related indemnification and insurance agreements 
such administrative and funding obligations would be terminated as to these categories of asbestos related claims in the case of a bankruptcy of pneumo abex or m f worldwide or of certain other events affecting the availability of coverage for such claims from third party indemnitors and insurers 
in the event of certain kinds of disputes with pneumo abex s indemnitors regarding their indemnities  the transfer agreement permits pneumo abex to require mcgi to fund of the costs of resolving the disputes 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which it manufactured or distributed asbestos containing products 
the subsidiary and its successors have pursued litigation against the insurers providing this coverage in order to confirm its availability and obtain its benefits 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers  payments by the original indemnitor and funding payments pursuant to the transfer agreement  all of pneumo abex s monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims other than as described below are 
table of contents managed and paid by others 
as of december   the company has not incurred and does not expect to incur material amounts related to asbestos related claims not subject to the arrangements described above the remaining claims 
management does not expect the remaining claims to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but the company is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that mcgi will assume from pneumo abex all liability for environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than matters relating to pneumo abex s former aerospace business 
accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the former aerospace business are the company s responsibility 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course  and mcgi manages and advances all costs associated with such matters pending reimbursement by the original indemnitor 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any of the sites subject to the indemnity from the original indemnitor due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the company does not itself expect to pay any of these costs due to the transfer agreement and the original indemnitor s indemnity 
the company considers pneumo abex s unassumed contingent claims  except for certain immaterial matters where no third party indemnification or assumption arrangement exists  to be the financial responsibility of those third parties and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their abilities to satisfy their obligations 
based upon these third parties repeated acknowledgements of their obligations  active management of these contingent claims  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of these third parties failing to satisfy these claims against pneumo abex is remote 
the friction guarantor has been fulfilling the friction buyer s obligations since  when the successor in interest to the friction buyer filed for chapter bankruptcy 
in october  pneumo abex received million plus interest earned since december  and the friction guarantor received million plus interest in full satisfaction of the claims of pneumo abex and the friction guarantor in the friction buyer s successor s bankruptcy case 
resolution of these claims did not affect the friction guarantor s guaranty in favor of pneumo abex 
pneumo abex s former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the united states government or to private contractors for the united states government 
pneumo abex retained in the aerospace sale certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the government made with respect to certain of these products 
in the first quarter of  pneumo abex resolved the final remaining pricing matter that it managed for a payment of million  resulting in a gain of million due to the release of a reserve previously accrued for this claim 
honeywell indemnification certain of the intermediate holding companies of the predecessor of harland clarke holdings had issued guarantees on behalf of operating companies formerly owned by these intermediate holding companies  which 
table of contents operating companies are not part of harland clarke holdings businesses 
in the stock purchase agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of the predecessor of harland clarke holdings by the company  honeywell agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assume  replace or terminate such guarantees and indemnify m f worldwide and its affiliates  including harland clarke holdings and its subsidiaries  with respect to all liabilities arising under such guarantees

the amended complaint alleged  among other things  that hfs s laserpro software permitted boe to generate loan documents that were deceptive and usurious in that they failed to disclose properly the effect of the method of calculating interest 
following the removal of the action to the united states district court for the southern district of illinois  the district court entered an order granting with prejudice hfs s motion to dismiss mr

many of the class actions and related warranty claims are at early stages  and their likely progress is not yet clear

various other legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against the company  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  environmental  safety and health matters  employment matters and other matters 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
in the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  the outcome of the matters referred to above will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
at december   harland clarke holdings had  million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement  million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility  million 
table of contents of floating rate senior notes and million of fixed rate senior notes 
at december   mafco worldwide had million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement and million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
at december   m f worldwide had million of short term debt outstanding 
all of these outstanding loans bear interest at variable rates  with the exception of the million of fixed rate senior notes 
accordingly  the company is subject to risk due to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that a hypothetical increase of percentage point in the variable component of interest rates applicable to its floating rate debt outstanding as of december  would have resulted in an increase in its annual interest expense of approximately million  including the effect of the interest rate derivative transactions discussed below 
in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on a portion of the outstanding variable rate debt  the company entered into interest rate derivative transactions in and in the form of swaps for harland clarke holdings with notional amounts totaling million currently outstanding  as further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the harland clarke holdings derivatives currently swap the underlying variable rates for fixed rates ranging from to 
as of december   the company s net foreign currency market exposures were million 
this is the value of the equity of the investments in the foreign subsidiaries in france  ireland  canada  israel and china 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw materials are made in united states dollars 
mafco worldwide s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as the united states dollar and purchases raw materials principally in united states dollars 
mafco worldwide s chinese subsidiaries primarily sell finished products and purchase raw materials in united states dollars 
since the exposures are not material on these transactions  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase in the related assets or liabilities 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease in the related assets or liabilities 
the company s investments include million of auction rate securities ars as of december   which are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
the company s ars investments are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
the ars are securities with long term nominal maturities ranging from to years for which the interest rates reset every or days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand at auction for ars investments collateralized by student loans  including auctions for ars investments held by the company 
as a result  these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
in the event the company needs to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  it will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until either a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the company does not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term  as of december  the ars were classified as long term investments 
the fair value of the ars as of december  was estimated utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
the analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the securities  the credit worthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  as well as forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period
