item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general the us economy has been in a recession since december caused by the global credit crisis and declining gdp  employment  business investment  corporate profits and consumer spending 
as a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy  lodging demand in the us has declined significantly throughout we have experienced significant declines in demand for hotel rooms associated with leisure  group  business and transient travel 
at december   we owned interests in hotel properties  which included direct ownership in hotel properties and between to interests in six hotel properties through majority owned investments in joint ventures which represents  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to noncontrolling joint venture partners 
in addition  at december   we owned million of mezzanine or first mortgage loans receivable and a interest in a joint venture with prudential real estate investors prei formed in january the prei jv 
the joint venture owned an million mezzanine loan at december  based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our current key priorities and financial strategies include  among other things preserving capital  enhancing liquidity  continuing current cost saving measures and creating long term shareholder value  implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability  implementing asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  repurchasing capital stock subject to regulatory limitations and our board of directors authorization  financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms  utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks  and making other investments or divestiture that our board of directors deems appropriate 
significant transactions and major developments in material impairments in june  extended stay hotels  llc esh  the issuer of our million principal balance mezzanine loan receivable secured by hotels with initial maturity in june  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection from its creditors 
this mezzanine loan was originally purchased for million 
at the time of esh s bankruptcy filing  a discount of million had been amortized to increase the 
table of contents carrying value of the note to million 
we anticipate that esh  through its bankruptcy filing  may attempt to impose a plan of reorganization which could extinguish our investment 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of million in earnings for the full amount of the book value of the note 
additional valuation allowances totaling million were recorded on four other mezzanine loans in see notes and to consolidated financial statements included in item beginning in june  we elected to cease making payments on the note payable of million secured by the hyatt regency dearborn hotel property 
due to the effect of market conditions in the region  the operating cash flows from the hotel property were not anticipated to cover the principal and interest payments on the note and the related capital expenditures on the property 
the lender issued a notice of default and an acceleration notice 
we did not cure the notice of default and intended to fully settle the debt via a deed in lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure of the hotel property 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended june   to write down the carrying amount of the hotel property to its estimated fair value 
effective december   a receiver appointed by the state of michigan circuit court completed taking possession and full control of the hotel property 
as a result  the hotel property was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements and a loss of million was recognized at deconsolidation 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item applying a similar cash flow analysis to the westin o hare hotel property  we anticipated that the operating cash flows from the underlying hotel property would be inadequate to cover the related debt service payments for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis  beginning in december  we stopped making payments on the note payable of million secured by the westin o hare hotel property under the terms of a forbearance agreement entered into with the lender which grants us a grace period through march  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  to write down the carrying amount of the hotel property to its estimated fair value 
we are currently working with the lender for a deed in lieu of foreclosure during the lender extended grace period 
we expect that if the deed in lieu of foreclosure successfully closes  the property is deeded back to the lender and we are legally released from our obligations in the future  a gain of approximately million will be recognized for financial statement purposes 
there should be no cash proceeds associated with such a gain 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item sale and settlement of notes receivable in november  we completed the sale of the million mezzanine loan receivable secured by the westin westminster hotel property that was defeased by the original borrower 
we negotiated for the release of the portfolio of government agency securities serving as the defeased loan collateral  and sold the actual securities via an auction for million 
we received net proceeds of million and recorded a gain of million 
in addition  in february  we received repayment of million and a million note for the settlement of the million mezzanine loan receivable secured by the ritz carlton hotel property in key biscayne  florida 
the carrying amount of this loan was million before the impairment charge of million recorded in the quarter ended september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item interest rate derivative transactions in an effort to take advantage of declining libor rates  we have entered into a series of interest rate derivatives  referred to as flooridors and corridors beginning in march the interest rate flooridor combines two interest rate floors  structured such that the purchaser simultaneously buys an interest rate floor at a strike rate x and sells an interest rate floor at a lower strike rate y 
the purchaser of the flooridor is paid when the underlying interest rate index for example  libor resets below strike rate x during the term of the flooridor 
unlike a standard floor  the flooridor limits the benefit the purchaser can receive as the related interest rate index falls 
once the underlying index falls below strike y  the sold floor offsets the purchased floor 
the interest rate corridor involves purchasing of an interest rate cap at one strike rate x and selling an interest rate cap with a higher strike rate y 
the purchaser of the corridor is paid when the underlying interest rate index resets above the strike rate x during the term of the corridor 
the corridor limits the benefit the purchaser can receive as the related interest rate index rises above the strike rate y 
there is no liability to us other than the purchase price associated with the flooridor and corridor 
in march  we entered into a one year flooridor with a financial institution for the period commencing december  and ending december  for a notional amount of billion 
the billion flooridor establishes a floor rate of 
under the new flooridor  the counterparty will pay us interest on the notional amount when libor rates are below the original floor of up to a maximum of basis points on the notional amount 
the cost of this flooridor was million 

table of contents on july   we purchased two one year term flooridors  each with a notional amount of billion 
under the first flooridor  the counterparty pays us interest on the notional amount for the period commencing december  and ending december  when libor rates are below up to a maximum of basis points on the notional amount 
under the second flooridor  the counterparty will pay us interest on the notional amount for the period commencing december  and ending december  when libor rates are below up to a maximum of basis points on the notional amount 
the cost of this flooridor was million 
in october  we entered into another three month flooridor transaction for the period commencing october  and ending december  for a notional amount of billion 
under the flooridor  the counterparty paid us interest on the notional amount as libor rates remained below the floor of  up to a maximum of basis points 
the cost of this flooridor was million which was offset by the income received from this flooridor 
for the year ended december   we recognized income of million on our interest rate derivatives 
in addition  we recognized a million unrealized loss for changes in fair values of our interest rate derivatives 
in addition  during  we entered into eight interest rate caps with total notional amounts of million to cap the interest rates on our mortgage loans with an aggregate principal amount of million aggregate principal balance at december  was million with strike rates between and 
the total price for these hedges was  these interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges 
in december  we also entered into an interest rate corridor  which was designated as a cash flow hedge  with a notional amount of million to effectively lower the existing interest rate cap on one of our floating rate mortgage loans for the period between december and may under the corridor  the counterparty will pay us interest on the notional amount when libor rates are above up to a maximum of basis points during the term of the corridor 
the cost of this corridor was  we have no further liability under the flooridors and the corridor to the counterparties 
repurchases of common and preferred shares and prepayment of outstanding debt obligations in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized a million common stock repurchase program  which was increased by million in september  and the program was subsequently amended to include both common and preferred stock 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional million for the repurchase plan and expanded the plan to include not only common and preferred stock but prepayment of our outstanding debt obligations  including debt secured by our hotel assets and debt senior to our mezzanine or loan investments 
in february  the board of directors expanded the repurchase program further to include the potential repurchase of units of our operating partnership 
during  we purchased million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share   shares of the series a preferred stock at an average price of per share and  shares of the series d preferred stock at an average price of per share for a total price of million  including  of commissions paid to brokers 
debt financing and refinancing in february  we refinanced a million principal balance mortgage loan excluding a premium of million secured by a hotel property in arlington  virginia  with a million mortgage loan at an interest rate of libor plus for three years with two one year extension options 
in addition  in march  we obtained a million mortgage loan on a previously unencumbered hotel property in jacksonville  florida 
the new loan matures in april and bears an interest rate at the greater of or prime plus 
in june  we modified the original maturity of the million mortgage loan secured by the jw marriott hotel property from september to march and paid down the outstanding principal balance by million 
the modified mortgage has an interest rate at libor plus with a libor floor rate of 
in november  we refinanced two mortgage loans secured by seven hotel properties with two new loans secured by five hotel properties 
the loans that were refinanced had principal balances of million and million and maturity dates in march and april  respectively 
the new loans consist of a senior loan with a principal amount of million and a junior loan with a principal amount of million million was advanced at closing with a blended interest rate of  and each matures in december the refinance unencumbered two hotel properties previously collateralizing the refinanced mortgage loans 

table of contents in december  we refinanced a million mortgage loan collateralized by a hotel property in tucson  arizona  maturing in june  with a new loan having the same principal balance and bearing interest rate at the greater of or libor plus for a term of five years 
liquidity and capital resources our cash position from operations is affected primarily by macro industry movements in occupancy and rate as well as our ability to control costs 
further  interest rates greatly affect the cost of our debt service as well as the financial hedges we put in place 
we monitor very closely the industry fundamentals as well as interest rates 
the strategy is that if the economy underperforms negatively affecting industry fundamentals  some or all of the loss in cash flow will be offset by our financial hedges due to what we believe to be the fed probably keeping interest rates low 
alternatively  if the fed raises interest rates because of inflation  our properties should benefit from the ability to rapidly raise room rates in an inflationary environment 
capex expenditures above our reserves will affect cash flow as well  however  we believe that such excess capex expenditures will not be significant in the near future 
our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include positive cash flow from operations  principal payments or sales of mezzanine loans  property refinancing proceeds  asset sales  and net cash derived from interest rate derivatives 
our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls  owner funded capital expenditures  debt interest and principal payments  and repurchases of our securities 
items that impacted our cash flows and liquidity are summarized as follows net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities  pursuant to our consolidated statement of cash flows which includes the changes in balance sheet items  were million and million for and  respectively 
the decline is principally due to the economic downturn that resulted in reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms 
the decline is partially offset by interest payments on indebtedness decreasing by million resulting from a sharp decline in libor rates during net cash flows used in provided by investing activities 
in  investing activities used cash of million for improvements to various hotel properties and a cash balance of million was eliminated as a result of the deconsolidation of the hyatt regency hotel property 
investing activities in provided cash of million from the sale of a mezzanine loan   from the sale of an interest in a laundry joint venture and a piece of land adjacent to a hotel property  and million from insurance settlements on hotel properties damaged by hurricane ike 
for  investing activities provided net cash flows of million  which consisted of net proceeds of million from sales of hotel properties and one office building and a payment of million for the note receivable acquired by prei jv 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million for acquisitions or originations of notes receivable  million for the acquisition of a interest in a mezzanine loan acquired by prei jv  and million of improvements to various hotel properties 
net cash flows used in provided by financing activities 
for  net cash flow used in financing activities was million 
cash outlays consisted of payments of i million on indebtedness and capital leases  ii loan costs of million  iii dividends of million  iv million for entering into interest rate derivatives  v million to acquire treasury shares  vi million to purchase series a and series d preferred stocks  vii  for distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures  and viii  for the redemption of operating partnership units 
these cash outlays were partially offset by million from debt refinancing and million in cash payments from the counterparties of the interest rate derivatives 
for  net cash flow used in financing activities was million consisting of payments of i million on indebtedness and capital leases  ii dividends of million  iii million for entering into interest rate swap  floor and cap transactions  million for purchases of treasury shares  and million of debt refinancing costs 
these cash outlays were partially offset by million of aggregate draws on our million credit facility and refinances of existing mortgage loans  cash payments of million from the counterparties of the interest rate derivatives  and  attributed to buy ins of long term incentive partnership units issued to our executives under the our equity incentive plan 
as noted above  in the last two years  we have used significant net cash flow for our stock repurchase program 
we have repurchased shares of our common and preferred stock in the market since the fourth quarter of we believe this continued repurchase program will ultimately be beneficial for our long term investors 
we do recognize that using cash to buy back shares consumes cash which could be used for other corporate purposes  however  we are continuously monitoring our cash position  our cash flow  our recourse obligations  and our debt maturities in light of our ongoing repurchase program in an effort to avoid any cash flow imbalances 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under various preferred equity  debt  and derivative agreements 
if we violate covenants in any debt agreements or the derivative agreement  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of certain debt covenants may result in us being unable to borrow unused amounts under a line of credit  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
in any event  financial covenants under our current or future debt obligations could impair our planned business strategies by limiting our ability to borrow i beyond certain amounts or ii for certain purposes 
presently  our existing financial debt covenants primarily relate to maintaining minimum debt coverage ratios at certain properties  maintaining an overall minimum net worth  maintaining a maximum loan to value  and maintaining an overall minimum total assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our debt agreements and a derivative agreement as amended 
we are diligently working to extend out all our debt maturities and soon we hope to have most or all pushed out to december or later 
virtually  our only recourse obligation is our million senior credit facility with banks  which is fully drawn and expires in april with two one year extension options that will take the maturity to april the main covenants in this senior credit facility include i the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of x through march  x at december   and x thereafter until expiration  and ii the maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of at december  
the only requirement to extend the credit facility is that the facility be in a non default status with regards to the covenants 
we believe we will be able to extend or refinance a portion or all of this obligation before maturity  and if it becomes necessary to pay down the principal balance  we believe we will be able to accomplish that with cash on hand  equity raises or  to the extent necessary  asset sales 

table of contents the articles governing our series b preferred stock require us to maintain certain covenants 
the impairment charges recorded during the quarter ended june  could have prevented us from satisfying one financial ratio 
however  the holder of the series b preferred stock reviewed the specific impairment charges and agreed to exclude the impairment charges incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of as they impact the financial ratio calculations for the affected periods 
at december   we are in compliance with all covenants required under the articles governing the series b preferred stock 
we continue to execute aggressive cost saving measures at the property level that include payroll freezes  vendor contract renegotiation and adjustments to service levels 
in addition  corporate level cost containment plans have been implemented 
we may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions 
based upon the current level of operations  management believes that our cash flow from operations along with our significant cash balances will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
with respect to upcoming maturities  we have eliminated our non extendable loan maturities and will continue to proactively address our upcoming maturities 
no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue mortgage financing on individual properties and our mortgage investments 
we are committed to an investment strategy where we will opportunistically pursue hotel acquisitions and share repurchases as suitable situations arise 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from future borrowings under a credit facility or other loans  or from proceeds from additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities  asset sales  joint ventures and loan investment payoffs 
however  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
our existing hotels are located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by the current economic downturn  or an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
dividend policy 
effective with the fourth quarter ended december   and in conjunction with the credit facility amendment outlined above  the board of directors suspended the common stock dividend for in december  the board of directors determined  subject to ongoing review  to continue the suspension of the common dividend in  except to the extent required to maintain our reit status 
we may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing reit distribution requirements 
results of operations marriott international  inc marriott manages of our properties 
for these marriott managed hotels  the fiscal year reflects twelve weeks of operations for each of the first three quarters of the year and seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year 
therefore  in any given quarterly period  period over period results will have different ending dates

revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar 
table of contents does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire year 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in adr are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees 
in april  we acquired a property hotel portfolio cnl portfolio from cnl hotels and resorts  inc cnl 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired of properties and interests ranging from to in properties through existing joint ventures 
in conjunction with the cnl transaction  we acquired the remaining joint venture interest in one hotel property not owned by cnl at the acquisition and acquired in may two other hotel properties previously owned by cnl collectively  the cnl acquisition 
in december  we completed an asset swap with hilton hotels corporation hilton  whereby we surrendered our majority ownership interest in two hotel properties in exchange for hilton s minority ownership interest in nine hotel properties 
net of subsequent sales and the asset swap  and of these hotels were included in our hotel property portfolio at december  and  respectively 
in  we finalized the allocation of the cnl acquisition purchase price

room revenues decreased million  or during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
occupancy declined by basis points from to 
adr declined by to 
decline in market demand has placed tremendous pressure on rates to maintain occupancy levels 
we observed businesses adopting cost saving initiatives on their travel and meeting expenses 
food and beverage experienced a similar decline of million due to lower volume on catering and banquet events 
other hotel revenue experienced a million decline due to lower occupancy 
rental income from the triple net operating lease decreased  primarily due to the lower occupancy and adr during interest income from notes receivable decreased million for compared to this decrease is primarily due to the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan that was reserved during as a result of the borrower s bankruptcy filing 
prior to the bankruptcy filing in june  all payments on this loan were current 
we recorded income from this loan of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is also attributable to i the two mezzanine loans that were repaid during  ii four other mezzanine loans that were impaired during and three of which were in default for at least a portion of income recognized on impaired loans was million and million for and  respectively  and iii the decline in libor rates during asset management fees and other was  for and million for the decrease is primarily due to the expiration in of an asset management consulting agreement with a related party which accounted for million of the income in hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees 
we experienced a reduction of million in direct expenses and a million reduction in indirect expenses and management fees in the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to the decline in occupancy 
the decline in indirect expenses was also attributable to the result of cost saving initiatives adopted by the hotel managers 
the direct expenses were of total hotel revenue for as compared to during beginning in december  we executed aggressive cost saving measures at the property level that included payroll freezes  vendor contract renegotiation and adjustments to service levels 
property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other remained at approximately million for both and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  for compared to primarily due to certain assets that had been fully depreciated during the decrease is partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense as a result of capital improvements made at several hotel properties 
impairment charges 
impairment charges for our continuing operations of million for related to the valuation allowance on the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan  four other mezzanine notes  and the westin o hare hotel property 
of the total impairment charges  million was the valuation allowance recorded for the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan  million for four other mezzanine notes  and million for the 
table of contents westin o hare hotel property 
impairment charge of million for the deconsolidated hyatt regency dearborn hotel property is included in the operating results of discontinued operations 
in evaluating possible loan impairment  we analyze our notes receivable individually and collectively for possible loan losses in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
based on the analysis  if we conclude that no loans are individually impaired  we then further analyze the specific characteristics of the loans  based on other authoritative guidance to determine if there would be probable losses in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
the loans in our portfolio are collateralized by hotel properties 
some loans are collateralized by single hotel properties and others by hotel portfolios 
the hotel properties are in different geographic locations  have different ages and a few of the properties have recently completed significant renovations which have a significant impact on the value of the underlying collateral 
the hotel properties include independent and nationally recognized brands in all segments and classes including luxury  economy  extended stay  full service  and select service 
in addition  our loan assets vary by position in the related borrower s capital structure  ranging from junior mortgage participations to mezzanine loans 
the terms of our notes or participations were structured based on the different features of the related collateral and the priority in the borrower s capital structure 
the authoritative accounting guidance requires that an individual loan not impaired individually be included in the assessment of the loss in a group of loans only if specific characteristics of the loan indicate that it is probable that there would be an incurred loss in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
as loans in our portfolio have significantly different risk factors and characteristics  such as different maturity terms  different types and classes of collateral  different interest rate structures  and different priority status  we concluded that the characteristics of the loans within the portfolio were not sufficiently similar as to allow an evaluation of these loans as a group for possible impairment within the authoritative accounting guidance 
investments in hotel properties are reviewed for impairment for each reporting period 
we take into account the latest operating cash flows and market conditions and their impact on future projections 
for the properties that showed indicators of impairment  we perform a recoverability analysis using the sum of each property s estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the property s carrying value 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions about the future operating results including disposition of the property 
in addition  the cash flow estimation periods used are based on the properties remaining useful lives to us expected holding periods 
for properties securing mortgage loans  the assumptions regarding holding periods considered our ability and intent to hold the property to or beyond the maturity of the related indebtedness 
in analyzing projected hotel properties operating cash flows  we factored in declining revenue for periods through and growth thereafter based on revenue per available room  or revpar  data from third party sources 
in addition  the projected hotel properties operating cash flows factored in our ongoing implementation of asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and implement extensive cost cutting measures 
after factoring in the declines in revenue expected by the third party sources and the impact of company specific strategies implemented to minimize operating costs  the hotel properties estimated future undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the properties carrying values 
the analyses performed in  did not identify any other properties with respect to which an impairment loss should be recognized 
for a full description of impairment charges  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the executive overview 
corporate general and administrative 
corporate general and administrative expense increased million in from the higher expenses for is primarily due to increases in i accrued bonuses of million resulting from the increased target incentives for certain executives approved by the board of directors in september  ii accrued legal expense of million primarily associated with the lawsuit related to the esh mezzanine loan  and iii accrual of  for tax indemnities associated with the sale of two hotel properties in these increases were partially offset by decreases in i stock based compensation of million as a result of certain restricted stock awards granted in earlier years at a higher cost per share being fully vested in the first quarter of  ii accrued accounting and audit fees of  and iii other corporate expenses resulting from the continued cost containment plans implemented at the corporate level 
in december  we implemented a cost saving plan at the corporate level which included reductions in overhead from staff layoffs  salary freezes  and other cost saving measures 

table of contents equity earnings loss in unconsolidated joint venture 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint venture were million for and equity loss for was million 
equity loss for is primarily a result of a mezzanine loan held by the joint venture that was fully reserved in the fourth quarter of excluding the valuation allowance  equity income recognized from the joint venture was million for the decrease is primarily due to the write off of the costs incurred by the joint venture for terminated transactions and the lost income on the fully reserved loan 
interest income 
interest income decreased million in compared to primarily due to the significant decline in short term interest rates and lower average cash balances during other income 
other income was million and million in and  respectively 
other income included income from non hedge interest rate swaps  floors and flooridors of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to significant decreases in libor rates that the derivatives are tied to as a result of the economic downturn and new interest rate derivatives we entered into during also included in were a gain of million recognized on the sale of a mezzanine note receivable  income of million recognized for business interruption insurance proceeds received related to hotel properties sold in  and a gain of  from the sale of our interest in a laundry joint venture 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs decreased million to million for from million for the decline is primarily attributable to the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt as a result of continued decline in libor rates 
the decrease was partially offset by the higher weighted average debt balance during write off of loan cost and exit fees 
during we refinanced mortgage debt totaling million 
the unamortized premiums of million and loan costs of million on the refinanced loans were written off 
during  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of  on the million debt that was refinanced with a million debt and incurred  of prepayment penalties on the payoff of another loan 
unrealized loss gain on derivatives 
we recorded an unrealized loss of million in and an unrealized gain of million in on our interest rate derivatives 
the decrease was primarily a result of the movements in the libor forward curve used in determining the fair values during income tax expense 
income tax expense for continuing operations was million and  for and  respectively 
the increase in is due to providing for income taxes on one of our trs subsidiaries that began to generate taxable income in and not being able to record any tax benefits from trs subsidiaries net operating loss carrybacks as was done in as a result of ashford trs losses in and prior years  and the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the utilization of net operating losses of acquired subsidiaries  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not our gross deferred tax asset will not be realized  and therefore  have provided a valuation allowance to fully reserve the balance 
loss income from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million for and income from discontinued operations was million for included in loss income from discontinued operations was a loss of million from deconsolidation of the hyatt regency dearborn hotel property for  and gains on sales of million for operating results of discontinued operations also reflected interest and related debt expense of million and million for and  respectively 
in addition  unamortized loan costs of million were written off in when the related debt was repaid upon the sale of the hotel properties collateralizing that debt 
the result also reflects a million write off of loan premiums upon the sale of related hotel property 
loss income from consolidated joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests 
during and  the noncontrolling interest partners in consolidated joint ventures were allocated a loss of  and an income of million  respectively 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated joints ventures represent ownership ranging from to of six hotel properties held by two joint ventures

the increase was substantially due to the million in incremental revenues attributable to the non comparable hotels  which is offset by a million decrease in revenues from comparable hotels as a result of the economic downturn 
mezzanine loans originated and acquired in contributed a million increase in interest income from notes receivable which was partially offset by decreased interest income from existing variable rate notes as a result of significantly lower libor rates in fees received from certain asset management consulting agreements we entered into in december also contributed  to the increase 
room revenues at comparable hotels for decreased million  or  compared to  primarily due to a slight decrease in revpar from to driven by decrease in occupancy principally as a result of the economic downturn and four hotel properties being under renovation 
the effect of decreased occupancy is partially offset by a increase in adr 
excluding the four hotel properties under renovation  the remaining comparable hotel properties revpar decreased from in to in driven by a increase in adr which effect was partially offset by a decrease in occupancy 
due to the economic downturn  many hotels experienced lower occupancy rates  however  the lower occupancy was partially offset by moderate increases in adr which is consistent with industry trends 
certain hotels benefited from increasing or garnering more favorable group room night contracts  eliminating less favorable contracts  and charging higher rates on transient business 
although occupancy increased at several hotels  renovations at certain hotels reduced room availability  which offset these increases

depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for compared to the increase was primarily associated with the non comparable hotels which accounted for million of the increase 
during  we finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the cnl acquisition which resulted in adjustments to asset values and the reclassification of certain assets into asset groups that have longer useful lives 
in addition  a million increase of depreciation was attributable to capital improvements made at several comparable hotels in corporate general and administrative 
corporate general and administrative expense increased to million for compared to million for these expenses included non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million for and  respectively 
excluding the non cash stock based compensation  these expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the increase in headcount and audit and legal expenses and as a result of the cnl acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a  credit recorded for the deferred compensation expense as the accrued liability under the deferred compensation declined due to the decrease in the value of the related investments 
in december  we implemented a cost saving plan at the corporate level which included reductions in overhead from staff layoffs  salary freezes  and reduced benefits and fees along with other cost saving measures 
equity loss in unconsolidated joint venture 
equity loss in the prei jv of million represents our of the interest in the operating results of the prei jv 
interest earned on the mezzanine notes was million which was offset by an impairment charge of million 
in october  the borrower of the mezzanine note receivable of million which matures in defaulted on debt service payments on both the first mortgage and our mezzanine loan 
after an impairment test  we and our joint venture partner determined to provide a loss reserve for the entire amount of the loan balance 
interest income 
interest income decreased million for compared to primarily due to the significant decline in short term interest rates which was partially offset by an increase in average cash balances 
other income 
other income of million represents the interest income of million on the non hedge interest rate swap  cap and floor that we entered into since march which was partially offset by a loss of  recorded for the change in cash surrender value related to an insurance contract for our deferred compensation plan 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs increased million to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to 
table of contents higher average debt balance in as a result of the cnl acquisition in april as the related borrowings on the acquisition were not outstanding for the entire period 
this increase was partially offset by the decreased interest costs related to our variable rate debt as a result of lower libor rates during write off of loan cost and exit fees 
during  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of  on the million loan that was refinanced with a million new loan and incurred  of prepayment penalties on other loans 
during  we repaid the balance and terminated two credit facilities with total borrowing capacity of million 
we also paid off our then outstanding loans totaling million 
in connection with these terminations and pay offs  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of million and incurred prepayment penalties of  of which  was allocated to continuing operations 
unrealized gains losses on derivatives 
in  we entered into various interest rate swap  floor and cap transactions that were not designated as hedges 
as a result  the changes in market value of these derivatives are included in earnings 
during  we recorded unrealized gains of million on these derivatives as a result of the libor future curve used in determining the fair values turning significantly downward during the fourth quarter as a result of the global economic downturn 
unrealized losses were  and  for and  respectively  on other interest rate caps that were designated as cash flow hedges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item income tax expense 
income tax expense was  and million for and  respectively 
the tax expense consisted primarily of certain state taxes assessed on partnership subsidiaries and the texas margin tax 
income tax for consists primarily of the expense associated with fully reserving our deferred tax asset at december  as a result of ashford trs losses in and prior years  and the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the utilization of net operating losses of acquired subsidiaries  we believe that it is more likely than not our gross deferred tax asset will not be realized  and therefore  have provided a valuation allowance to fully reserve against the balance 
income from discontinued operations 
included in income from discontinued operations were gains of million and million from hotel sales for and  respectively 
operating results of discontinued operations also reflected interest and related debt expense of million and million for and  respectively 
in addition  unamortized loan costs of million and million in and  respectively  were written off when the related debt was repaid upon the sale of the hotel properties collateralizing that debt 
the result also reflects a million write off of loan premiums upon the sale of related hotel property 
loss income from consolidated joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures represent the joint venture partners who have ownerships of to in six hotel properties owned and operated by our consolidated joint ventures 
we acquired these joint ventures in connection with the cnl acquisition in april during and  the noncontrolling interest partners were allocated income from consolidated joint ventures of million and million  respectively 
net loss income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in operating partnership 
redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership represents the limited partners proportionate share of equity in earnings losses of the operating partnership which is an allocation of net income available to common stockholders based on the weighted average ownership percentage of these limited partners common unit holdings throughout the period plus dividends paid to these limited partners class b unit holdings 
net income allocated plus distributions made to these limited partners were million and million for and  respectively  including income from discontinued operations allocated to these limited partners of million and million for and  respectively 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities are subject to inflation as well 

table of contents seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months 
this seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements and do not currently anticipate any such arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in thousands payments due by period years total contractual obligations excluding extension options long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations contractual obligations including extension options long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations for variable interest rate indebtedness  interest obligations are estimated based on the libor interest rate at december  extensions exclude options subject to debt service coverage tests 
in addition to the amounts discussed above  we also have management agreements which require us to pay monthly management fees  market service fees and other general fees  if required 
these management agreements expire from through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
management agreements in connection with our acquisitions of marriott crystal gateway hotel in arlington  virginia  on july  and the hotel cnl portfolio on april   we assumed certain existing management agreements 
based on our review of these management agreements  we concluded that the terms of certain management agreements are more favorable to the respective managers than typical current market management agreements 
as a result  we recorded unfavorable contract liabilities related to these management 
table of contents agreements of million as of the respective acquisition dates based on the present value of expected cash outflows over the initial terms of the related agreements 
such unfavorable contract liabilities are being amortized as non cash reductions to incentive management fees on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related agreements 
in evaluating unfavorable contract liabilities  our analysis involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
income taxes at december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million which fully offsets our gross deferred tax asset 
as a result of ashford trs losses in  and  and the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the utilization of net operating losses of acquired subsidiaries  we believe that it is more likely than not our gross deferred tax asset will not be realized  and therefore  have provided a valuation allowance to fully reserve the balance 
at december   we also recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference in the final purchase price allocation for financial reporting purposes and tax basis for a real estate asset owned in one of our consolidated joint ventures 
in addition  at december   ashford trs has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future taxable income  if any  through the analysis utilized in determining our deferred tax asset valuation allowance involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative accounting guidance effective january  the accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
the accounting guidance also requires that a determination be made as to whether it is more likely than not that a tax position taken  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any appeals and litigation processes 
if the more likely than not threshold is met  the related tax position must be measured to determine the amount of provision or benefit  if any  to recognize in the financial statements 
the accounting guidance applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to other authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes but does not apply to tax positions related to accounting guidance related to accounting for contingencies 
we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and cities 
tax years through remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities 
a federal income tax examination of one of our trs subsidiaries is currently in process 
we believe that the results of the completion of this examination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as we determined no material unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities exist  the adoption of the new authoritative accounting guidance effective january   did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense 
investment in hotel properties hotel properties are generally stated at cost 
however  the initial properties contributed upon ashford s formation are stated at the predecessor s historical cost  net of impairment charges  if any  plus a noncontrolling interest partial step up related to the acquisition of noncontrolling interests from third parties associated with four of the initial properties 
for hotel properties owned through our majority owned joint ventures  the carrying basis attributable to the joint venture partners minority ownership is recorded at the predecessor s historical cost  net of any impairment charges  while the carrying basis attributable to our majority ownership is recorded based on the allocated purchase price of our ownership interests in the joint ventures 
all improvements and additions which extend the useful life of the hotel properties are capitalized 
impairment of investment in hotel properties hotel properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we test impairment by using current or projected cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset 
in evaluating the impairment of hotel properties  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  expected holding period and expected useful life 
we may also use fair values of comparable assets 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  we record an impairment charge for the amount that the property s net book value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during  we recorded impairment charges of million on one hotel property 
the impairment charge of million for the deconsolidated hyatt regency dearborn hotel property is included in the operating results of discontinued operations 
see the detailed discussion in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of the assets  while amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
presently  hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over lives which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures  
table of contents and equipment 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss as well as resulting gains or losses on potential hotel sales 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we classify assets as held for sale when management has obtained a firm commitment from a buyer  and consummation of the sale is considered probable and expected within one year 
in addition  we deconsolidate a property when it becomes subject to the control of a government  court  administrator or regulator and we effectively lose control of the property subsidiary 
when deconsolidating a property subsidiary  we recognize a gain or loss in net income measured as the difference between the fair value of any consideration received and the carrying amount of the former property subsidiary 
the related operations of assets held for sale are reported as discontinued if a such operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  both operationally and financially  from the our ongoing operations  b such operations and cash flows will be eliminated from ongoing operations once the disposal occurs  and c we will not have any significant continuing involvement subsequent to the disposal 
notes receivable we provide mezzanine and first mortgage financing in the form of notes receivable 
these loans are held for investment and are intended to be held to maturity and accordingly  are recorded at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts and net of the allowance for losses when a loan is deemed to be impaired 
premiums  discounts  and net origination fees are amortized or accreted as an adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the loan 
we discontinue recording interest and amortizing discounts premiums when the contractual payment of interest and or principal is not received 
variable interest entities  as defined by authoritative accounting guidance  must be consolidated by their controlling interest beneficiaries if the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
our mezzanine and first mortgage notes receivable are each secured by various hotel properties or partnership interests in hotel properties and are subordinate to the controlling interest in the secured hotel properties 
all such notes receivable are considered to be variable interests in the entities that own the related hotels 
however  we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these hotel properties as a result of holding these loans 
therefore  we do not consolidate the hotels for which we have provided financing 
we will evaluate the interests in entities acquired or created in the future to determine whether such entities should be consolidated 
in evaluating variable interest entities  our analysis involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
impairment of notes receivable we review notes receivables for impairment in each reporting period pursuant to the applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts recorded as assets on the balance sheet according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply normal loan review and underwriting procedures as may be implemented or modified from time to time in making that judgment 
when a loan is impaired  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate against the value of the asset recorded on the balance sheet 
we may also measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  we record a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings for any shortfall 
our assessment of impairment is based on considerable judgment and estimates 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance of million for our mezzanine loan portfolio 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item investment in unconsolidated joint venture investment in a joint venture in which we have a ownership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting by recording the initial investment and our percentage of interest in the joint venture s net income 
the equity accounting method is employed due to the fact that we do not have control or power to direct the activities of the joint venture  nor do we have the obligation to absorb the loss of the joint venture or the rights to the joint venture s residual returns 
we review the investment in our unconsolidated joint venture for impairment in each reporting period pursuant to the applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
the investment is impaired when its estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of our investment 
any impairment is recorded in equity earnings loss in unconsolidated joint venture 
derivative financial instruments and hedges we primarily use interest rate derivatives to capitalize on the historical correlation between changes in libor london interbank offered rate and revpar revenue per available room 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments or vice versa over 
table of contents the life of the derivative agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps provide us with interest rate protection above the strike rate on the cap and result in us receiving interest payments when actual rates exceed the cap strike 
for interest rate floors  we pay our counterparty interest when the variable interest rate index is below the strike rate 
the interest rate flooridor combines two interest rate floors  structured such that the purchaser simultaneously buys an interest rate floor at a strike rate x and sells an interest rate floor at a lower strike rate y 
the purchaser of the flooridor is paid when the underlying interest rate index for example  libor resets below strike rate x during the term of the flooridor 
unlike a standard floor  the flooridor limits the benefit the purchaser can receive as the related interest rate index falls 
once the underlying index falls below strike y  the sold floor offsets the purchased floor 
the interest rate corridor involves purchasing an interest rate cap at strike rate x and selling an interest rate cap with a higher strike rate y 
the purchaser of the corridor is paid when the underlying interest rate index resets above the strike rate x during the term of the corridor 
the corridor limits the benefit the purchaser can receive as the related interest rate index rises above the strike rate y 
there is no additional liability to us other than the purchase price associated with the flooridor and corridor 
we account for the interest rate derivatives at fair value in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheets at their fair values and reported as interest rate derivatives 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss oci in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the amount recorded in oci is reclassified to interest expense in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings  while the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings as unrealized gain loss on derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations 
for derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as unrealized gain loss on derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued authoritative accounting guidance to modify existing accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets 
the new guidance is effective at the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the new authoritative guidance limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets 
in addition  the guidance defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale and requires that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained including a transferor s beneficial interest and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
the impact of adopting this new guidance when effective will depend upon the nature  term and size of the assets transferred  if any 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative accounting guidance to redefine the characteristics of the primary beneficiary to be identified when an enterprise performs an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
this accounting guidance is effective at the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the new guidance requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed and ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
it also amends certain previous guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie 
upon adoption as of january   we will re assess our interests in vies on an ongoing basis in accordance with this accounting guidance to determine that entities are properly reflected in our financial statements as investments or consolidated entities 
as of january   we adopted this new guidance and the adoption of the new guidance does not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued an accounting standard update  effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after the issuance date  to provide guidance on measuring liabilities at fair value when no observable data are available 
the update clarifies that when measuring fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using either i the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets  or ii the present value technique or a market approach based on the amount at the measurement date the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability 
we do not expect a material impact from the adoption of this accounting guidance 
non gaap financial measures ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to the company before interest expense  interest income other than interest income from mezzanine loans  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership 
we present ebitda because we believe it provides useful information to investors as it is an indicator of our ability to meet our future debt payment requirements  working capital requirements and it provides an overall evaluation of our financial condition 
ebitda  as calculated by us may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a indicator of liquidity 
the following table reconciles net loss to ebitda in thousands year ended december  net loss income loss income from consolidated joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests net loss income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in operating partnership 
net loss income attributable to the company depreciation and amortization interest expense and amortization of loan costs income tax expense benefit net loss income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in operating partnership interest income ebitda ebitda is not adjusted for income received from interest rate derivatives because the related derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas and therefore  this income is reported as other income instead of a reduction of interest expense in accordance with gaap 
the white paper on funds from operations ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and net of adjustments for the portion of these items attributable to noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance of an equity reit to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined by gaap 
we compute ffo in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that either do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or interpret the nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to a gaap net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or b gaap cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
however  to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  we believe that ffo should be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments  our derivatives portfolio and notes receivable that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
at december   our billion debt portfolio included million of variable rate debt 
the impact on the results of operations of a basis point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate debt at december  would be approximately million per year 
periodically  we purchase derivatives to increase stability related to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps  caps and floors as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
beginning in march  we entered into various interest rate swap  cap  floor  and flooridor transactions that were not designated as hedges 
the changes in the fair market values of these transactions are recorded in earnings 
based on the libor rates in effect on december   the interest rate derivatives we entered into since would result in an income of approximately million for due to the interest rate cap and floor on these derivatives  a basis point change to the libor rates would not change the amount of the projected income on these derivatives 
at december   our million notes receivable included million of variable rate notes in accruing status 
the impact on the results of operations of a basis point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate notes at december  would be  annually 
the above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and lending portfolios  and assume no changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed at december   it does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
accordingly  the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time  and the related interest rates
