item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 
a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs  including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities  could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 
significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments  if any  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 
the form  timing and or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 
the form  timing and or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant 
the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 
we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock  in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 
we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock  as we did in the fourth quarter of taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received 
if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax  the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale 
furthermore  with respect to non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends  including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock 
in addition  the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms 
if we issue additional equity securities  the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 
difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 
federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held  acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community  and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders 
in addition  real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable 
these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 
subject to the requirements related to fund ii  we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis 
our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment  and our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate 
failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development  ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 
we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
as noted above  we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space  as is often the case with large urban in fill developments 
also  as noted above in item  business  through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a joint venture partner  we have a economic interest in a for sale development with a total estimated capital cost at completion of  on a site adjacent to one of our communities 
we may engage or have an interest in for sale activity in the future 
our historical experience in our existing markets in developing  owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets  should we choose to enter them  or that we will be successful in other activities 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets  including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 
land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop 
as discussed in item  communities other land and real estate assets  in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that the we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcel s then current fair value  less costs to dispose  we would be subject to an impairment charge  which would reduce our net income 
risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 
instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly  at times we invest as a partner or a co venturer 
joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks  including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due  that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses  that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours  and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests 
frequently  we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy sell arrangement  which could cause us to sell our interest  or acquire our partner s interest  at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 
risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary investment funds 
we formed fund i which  through a wholly owned subsidiary  we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested approximately  at december   representing our total capital commitment  for an equity interest of approximately 
we have also formed fund ii which  through a wholly owned subsidiary  we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed  representing a current equity interest of approximately 
we have invested approximately  at december  in fund ii 
these funds present risks  including the following investors in fund ii may fail to make their capital contributions when due and  as a result  fund ii may be unable to execute its investment objectives  our subsidiaries that are the general partners of the funds are generally liable  under partnership law  for the debts and obligations of the respective funds  subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the funds  investors in the funds holding a majority of the partnership interests may remove us as the general partner without cause  subject to our right to receive an additional nine months of management fees after such removal and our right to acquire one of the properties then held by the funds  while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds  the investors or an advisory committee comprised of representatives of the investors must approve certain matters  and as a result we may be unable to cause the funds to make certain investments or implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial  we can develop communities but have been generally prohibited from making acquisitions of apartment communities outside of fund ii  which is our exclusive investment vehicle until september or when of fund ii s capital is invested  subject to certain exceptions  and we may be liable and or our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the funds  or the reits through which a number of investors have invested in the funds and which we manage  fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters 
risk of earthquake damage 
as further described in item  communities insurance and risk of uninsured losses  many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults 
we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels 
in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits  we could lose our capital invested in the affected community  as well as anticipated future revenue from that community 
we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community 
any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity 
as a result  we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above  we carry commercial general liability insurance  property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured  in full or in part  because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur  we could lose our capital invested in a community  as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community 
we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community 
if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur  we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with  or court ordered damages to  that third party 
a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 
particularly in new england and the midwest  we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather  including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction 
in addition  inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 
we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non compliance 
under various federal  state and local environmental and public health laws  regulations and ordinances  we may be required  regardless of knowledge or responsibility  to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property  personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination 
these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination  may adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent the affected property 
in addition  some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 
the development  construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances  which regulate matters including wetlands protection  storm water runoff and wastewater discharge 
noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 
certain federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms 
we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed 
acms were  however  used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired 
we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 
we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 
all of our stabilized operating communities  and all of the communities that we are currently developing  have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment  which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling 
these assessments  together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties  have not revealed  and we are not otherwise aware of  any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  financial condition or results of operations 
in connection with our ownership  operation and development of communities  from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants  including contaminants in soil  groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings 
in some cases  an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates 
there can be no assurance  however  that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified  in full or at all  in the event that environmental liability arises 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures  and the need to remediate such mold  is not a new phenomenon  there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects  including allergic or other reactions 
to help limit mold growth  we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture 
we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented 
however  we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner 
if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 
our communities may also be affected by potential vapor intrusion risks resulting from subsurface soil or groundwater contamination by volatile organic compounds  which may require investigation or remediation and could subject the company to liability 
additionally  we have occasionally been involved in developing  managing  leasing and operating various properties for third parties 
consequently  we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and  therefore  potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 
we cannot assure you that the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities  no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments  no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared  the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  will not affect the environmental condition of our communities  future uses or conditions  including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations  will not result in the imposition of environmental liability  and no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability 
failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation  which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
in addition  unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification 
the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
furthermore  we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
thus  our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit  and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit  or that we will remain qualified in the future 
this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
in addition  future legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
even if we qualify as a reit  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  we may engage in activities that are not customarily provided by a landlord through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 
there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the following our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights  including voting rights  of any series of preferred stock issued 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 
to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year 
to maintain this qualification  and or to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock  our charter generally prohibits ownership directly  indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  or beneficially as defined in section of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock 
in general  under our charter  pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock 
under our charter  our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons  but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit 
these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 
our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director 
in a contested election  if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast  the incumbent directors would remain in office 
this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 
as a maryland corporation  we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law 
maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur  which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers  even if they are in our stockholders best interests 
in addition  other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that  if made or taken  could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

unresolved staff comments none 
item communities our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
the following is a description of each category current communities are categorized as established  other stabilized  lease up  or redevelopment according to the following attributes established communities also known as same store communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful  as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 
for the year ended december   the established communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes  had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of january   are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year 
a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment 
other stabilized communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in  and that have stabilized occupancy  as defined above 
other stabilized communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year 
lease up communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 
redevelopment communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
for communities that we wholly own  redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of  or of the community s acquisition cost 
the definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement  or by one of the funds 
development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community 
these communities may be partially complete and operating 
development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest  for which we are the buyer under a long term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community 
we capitalize related pre development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 
in addition  we own approximately  square feet of office space in alexandria  virginia  for our corporate office  with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 
in the third quarter of we entered into a ten year operating lease for approximately  square feet of office space in arlington  virginia  which will serve as the location for our corporate office by the end of the second quarter we are exploring alternatives to lease or sell the office space in alexandria  virginia 
as of december   communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows number of number of communities apartment homes current communities established communities new england metro ny nj mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total established other stabilized communities new england metro ny nj mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total other stabilized lease up communities redevelopment communities total current communities development communities development rights our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 
current communities our current communities are primarily garden style apartment communities consisting of two and three story buildings in landscaped settings 
as of january   these include garden style of which are mixed communities and or include town homes  high rise and mid rise apartment communities 
our communities offer a variety of quality amenities and features  including gourmet kitchens  lofts and vaulted ceilings  walk in closets  fireplaces  patios decks  and modern appliances 
other features at various communities may include swimming pools  fitness centers  tennis courts  and wi fi lounges 
we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes 
the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team  focused on the specific needs of residents  enhances market appeal to discriminating residents 
we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 
our current communities are located in the following geographic markets number of number of apartment percentage of total communities at homes at apartment homes at new england boston  ma fairfield county  ct metro ny nj long island  ny northern new jersey central new jersey new york  ny mid atlantic midwest washington  dc chicago  il pacific northwest seattle  wa northern california oakland east bay  ca san francisco  ca san jose  ca southern california los angeles  ca orange county  ca san diego  ca we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities 
during the year ended december   we completed construction of  apartment homes in nine communities and sold  apartment homes in five communities 
the average age of our current communities  on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes  is years 
when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity  as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date  the average age of our current communities is years 
of the current communities  as of january   we own a full fee simple  or absolute  ownership interest in operating communities  ten of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in october  november  july  december  july  december  april  september and march  a general partnership interest in three partnerships that each own a fee simple interest in an operating community  a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in both fund i and fund ii 
subsidiaries of fund i own a fee simple interest in operating communities  and subsidiaries of fund ii own a fee simple interest in two operating communities  a general partnership interest in two partnerships structured as downreits  as described more fully below  that own an aggregate of nine communities  a membership interest in six limited liability companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community  two of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in september  and november  and a residual profits interest with no ownership interest in a limited liability company to which an operating community was transferred upon completion of construction in the second quarter of for some communities  a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration 
we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october  november  july  december  april and march we also hold  directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries  the full fee simple ownership interest in the seven development communities  all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and two of which are subject to land leases expiring in may and april in our two partnerships structured as downreits  either avalonbay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner  and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest 
for each downreit partnership  limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner 
although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different  generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount 
the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock 
in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership  we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount 
as of january   there were  downreit partnership units outstanding 
the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

redevelopment communities as of december   we had seven consolidated communities under redevelopment 
we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be  excluding costs prior to redevelopment 
we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community 
accordingly  we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations  or that we will meet our budgeted costs  either individually or in the aggregate 
we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to communities owned by the funds  as well as communities in our current operating portfolio

restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of or greater physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of redevelopment 
development rights as of december   we are evaluating the future development of new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us  under contract  subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option 
we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land  although for of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 
the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately 
we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add  apartment homes to our portfolio 
substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 
at december   there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs  but excluding land costs of  relating to development rights 
in addition  land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of  are reflected as land held for development as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
in addition  we control certain land that is held for development under a year land lease agreement  with future minimum obligations of approximately  per year 
the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process 
the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in  if any  or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made  are business judgments that we make after we perform financial  demographic and other analyses 
in the event that we do not proceed with a development right  we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities  unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land  however  we cannot guarantee a recovery 
initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are charged to expense 
during  we incurred a charge of approximately  of pre development cost for development rights that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred  or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 
we also incurred a charge of  on three land parcels that were held for development that we do not currently intend to develop

this represents a portion of the aggregate land purchase that we will transact under a non cancelable commitment related to this expected development  as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
other land and real estate assets at december  we own land that we do not currently intend to develop with an aggregate carrying basis under gaap of  we believe that the current carrying basis of these assets is such that there is no charge for impairment  or further charge in the case of assets previously impaired 
however we may be subject to the recognition of further impairment charges in the event that there are indicators of such impairment  and we determine that the carrying basis of the assets is greater than the current fair value  less costs to dispose 
recent disposition activity we i sell assets that do not meet our long term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop  redevelop and acquire communities 
pending such redeployment  we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
on occasion  we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a non taxable  like kind exchange transaction 
from january  to january   we sold our interest in six wholly owned communities  containing  apartment homes 
the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was  insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured  in full or in part  because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
you should carefully review the discussion under item a  risk factors  of this form k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 
many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults 
many of our communities are near  and thus susceptible to  the major fault lines in california  including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault 
we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels 
we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington  for any single occurrence and in the aggregate   of coverage 
earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a  limit each occurrence and in the aggregate 
in california the deductible each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building 
our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a  deductible per occurrence except that the next  of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional self insured retention until the total incurred self insured retention exceeds  on december   we elected to cancel and rewrite our property insurance policy for a month term in order to take advantage of updated earthquake loss projections and declining insurance premium rates 
as a result  our property insurance premium decreased by approximately with no material changes in coverage 
we expect to renew this policy when it expires on may  in august  we renewed our general liability policy and worker s compensation coverage for a one year term  and experienced a decrease in the premium on these policies of approximately  with no material changes in the coverage 
these policies are in effect until august  just as with office buildings  transportation systems and government buildings  there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism 
in december  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back stop program until in connection with this legislation  we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to  additionally  we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts  not covered under tripra  such as domestic based terrorism 
this insurance  often referred to as non certified terrorism insurance  is subject to deductibles  limits and exclusions 
our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 
an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
for further discussion of the risks and the company s related prevention and remediation activities  please refer to the discussion under item a  risk factors we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non compliance  elsewhere in this report 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 
we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company  up to  per occurrence  from employee theft of money  securities or property 
item legal proceedings as previously reported  we are involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act fha and the americans with disabilities act 
the equal rights center erc filed a complaint against us on september  in the us district court  district of maryland with respect to properties 
in november  we settled this litigation by entering into a court approved consent decree 
under the consent decree we will inspect and  if necessary  remediate up to  apartment units and related public and common areas at our communities 
we expect that the remediation resulting from the inspections  which should occur over approximately a four year period  will enhance and or extend the useful life of the applicable communities and will therefore be capitalized 
although we will not be able to determine the exact remediation or associated costs until inspections are completed  we do not believe that the remediation costs will be material to the company 
on august  the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york filed a civil lawsuit against the company and the joint venture cvp i  llc in which it has an interest that owns avalon chrystie place 
the lawsuit alleges that avalon chrystie place was not designed and constructed in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the fha 
the company designed and constructed avalon chrystie place with a view to compliance with new york city s local law  which for more than years has been new york city s code regulating the accessible design and construction of apartments 
after the filing of its answer and affirmative defenses  during the fourth quarter of the plaintiff served the company with discovery requests relating to communities owned by the company nationwide 
the company objected to these discovery requests as being overly broad  as the plaintiff s complaint made factual allegations with regard to avalon chrystie place only 
a magistrate judge agreed with the company and limited discovery to avalon chrystie place 
the plaintiff is appealing the magistrate judge s ruling 
due to the preliminary nature of the department of justice matter  including whether the scope of their suit will be extended to other properties  we cannot predict or determine the outcome of that matter  nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 
on august   we filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of washington in the county of king avalon downreit v  lp v 
grand glacier  llc et al relating to our assertion that the homeowners association in which our former avalon wynhaven community is a part systematically overcharged us for various shared costs 
we sold this property in and agreed to indemnify the buyer for annual association fees to the extent they exceed an amount that we each agreed was reasonable 
the defendants have filed a cross claim against avalon downreit v  lp seeking foreclosure of the property and satisfaction of all amounts alleged to be due 
we intend to vigorously pursue our claim and defend against the counter claim 
we are negotiating a settlement of this litigation on terms that are not material to the company s operations or financial condition  but we cannot predict if or when we will settle this litigation  or the terms of a final judgment or settlement 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in various other claims and or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
while no assurances can be given  we do not believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our operations

ebitda is defined as net income before interest income and expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization from both continuing and discontinued operations 
under this definition  ebitda includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests 
management generally considers ebitda to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we generally consider funds from operations  or ffo  as defined below  to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 
consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  we calculate ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities  extraordinary gains or losses as defined by gaap  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  depreciation of real estate assets  and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent net income in accordance with gaap  and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income  which remains the primary measure  as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo 
ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

executive overview business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we believe that apartment communities are an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments  because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in new england  the new york new jersey metro area  the mid atlantic  the midwest  the pacific northwest  and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our time tested strategy is to be leaders in customer insight  market research and capital allocation  delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best performing us submarkets 
our communities are predominately upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
financial highlights and outlook for the year ended december   net income available to common stockholders was  compared to  for  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily due to the reduced number of communities sold and amount of gains related to these sales in as compared to the prior year  coupled with the loss recognized on the tender offer completed in october  offset somewhat by a decrease in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs 
detail of the impacts for the land impairments  abandoned pursuits as well as the charge for the tender offer and certain other non routine items is provided in the following table 
non routine items decrease increase in net income and ffo dollars in thousands full year full year land impairments abandoned pursuits severance and related costs federal excise tax gain loss on unsecured notes repurchase gain on sale of land joint venture income adjustment legal settlement proceeds  net preferred stock deferred offering expenses fund ii organizational costs total non routine items weighted average dilutive shares outstanding for purposes of non routine classification  abandoned pursuits includes costs we expensed for individual pursuits in excess of  in a given quarter 
includes our promoted interest of  in joint venture  and our pro rata portion of an impairment charge on a community in an unconsolidated joint venture of  apartment fundamentals continued to be challenged during job losses exceeded our expectations during the year  resulting in more than expected downward pressure on rental revenue 
our established community portfolio experienced a decline in year over year rental revenue of  comprised of a decrease in rental rates of and in economic occupancy of 
this decrease in revenues and an increase in operating expenses resulted in a decline in our established community portfolio noi of in from the prior year 
we expect earnings per share diluted eps will decrease to for from in  driven primarily by a decline in revenue and noi from our established communities in as compared to the prior year 
the recession  coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases  continues to adversely impact current operating fundamentals 
the expected decline in our noi is attributable largely to the effect of job losses experienced during the past two years 
employment is a leading demand driver  and we expect continued weak employment conditions to contribute to revenue declines in the impact of job losses on our results for may be somewhat offset by i the expected continued weakness in the for sale housing market during  ii growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent and iii constrained levels of new supply 
our current financial outlook for provides for a decline in rental revenue of between and in our established community portfolio resulting in a projected noi decline for our established communities of to 
we were again active in the capital markets in  raising in excess of  through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt  assets sales  sales of common equity in the public markets  and capital commitments for fund ii 
we have used the proceeds received to fund our development and redevelopment activities  to acquire an indirect interest in assets through fund ii  to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt  and to repay floating rate debt  while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes 
our focus on raising capital includes consideration for managing the maturity risk associated with our secured and unsecured debt obligations 
our activity includes the issuance of over  of secured financing and  of unsecured notes in september in two  tranches  one maturing in and the second maturing in a portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase  principal amount of some or all of the amounts outstanding on unsecured notes maturing over the next three years  effectively extending the duration of debt maturities while reducing interest costs 
we believe that our relatively modest level of secured and unsecured debt will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 
the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of five communities for a gross sales price of  we anticipate our level of disposition activity will be consistent in  within the range of gross sales of  to  occurring primarily during the first half of the year during we completed the development of nine communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of  we started the development of two communities  which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of  we expect an increase in investor demand for quality multifamily assets  due in part to the increased liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply resulting from the decline in development activity in all markets 
while we reduced our level of development during in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions  we believe that our development activity will continue to create long term value 
during  we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the market for a recovery in apartment fundamentals that we expect in and we anticipate new development starts in with a total projected capitalized cost of  consistent with this view  we also expect to increase redevelopment activity for our wholly owned communities in  during which we expect to start redevelopment of seven wholly owned communities 
during  we expect to disburse approximately  related to the seven communities under development at december   the new development starts  and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development 
we expect approximately  of the projected disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced tax exempt debt 
we believe that our current level of indebtedness  our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt and or common and preferred equity and secured debt  as well as from disposition proceeds  joint ventures or from retained cash 
we believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain scheduled maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to a continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor 
we increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through development and acquisitions 
while we grow principally through our demonstrated core competency of developing wholly owned assets from capital sources  we also acquire interests in additional assets  primarily through our investment in fund ii 
fund i is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and has invested approximately  in fund i  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march subsidiaries of fund i have loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  with varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty  ranging from october to september these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
fund ii is a second discretionary investment fund with six institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii 
fund ii was formed in august and  in the second quarter of  we added equity commitments for fund ii  resulting in total equity commitments from five institutional investors and us of  of which our commitment is  total equity commitments to fund ii in the second quarter of increased by  as a result of the following a new institutional investor made an equity commitment of an existing institutional investor increased its commitment by  based on terms of its existing commitment  and we decreased our commitment by  to  based on terms of our existing commitment  decreasing our equity interest to approximately 
fund ii can employ leverage of up to  allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately  and has a term that expires in august  plus two one year extension options 
fund ii now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investment interests in apartment communities until august or  if earlier  until of the committed capital of fund ii is invested  subject to limited exceptions 
fund ii will not include or involve our development activities 
we will receive  in addition to any returns on invested equity  asset management fees  property management fees and redevelopment fees 
we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met 
in  fund ii acquired two communities  avalon bellevue park  a apartment home community located in bellevue  washington and the hermitage  a apartment home community located in fairfax  virginia 
fund ii has invested  as of december  fund ii has one loan secured by an asset in the amount of  with a maturity of june this loan is payable by fund ii 
as of december   fund ii also has  outstanding under a credit facility that matures in december in february  fund ii acquired its third community  a apartment home community located in gaithersburg  maryland 
communities overview our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  development communities  and development rights 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities 
discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which seven communities were under construction and seven communities were under reconstruction 
of these communities  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes  including owned by subsidiaries of fund i and two owned by subsidiaries of fund ii 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional wholly owned communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities  noi derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of noi related to disposed communities  and capital market and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expense expensed development and other pursuit costs interest expense  net gain loss on extinguishment of debt  net  n a depreciation expense general and administrative expense impairment loss  n a gain on sale of land   n a total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of communities total discontinued operations net income net income loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests net income attributable to the company dividends attributable to preferred stock net income attributable to common stockholders net income attributable to common stockholders decreased  or  to  in primarily due to the reduced number of communities sold and amount of gains related to these sales in as compared to the prior year and the loss recognized on the early repurchase of debt completed in october the overall decline in net income was mitigated by a reduction in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs between years 
net income attributable to common stockholders increased  or in over the prior year period due primarily to gains from the sale of communities and year over year increases in community operating performance  partially offset by charges associated with land impairments and abandoned pursuits as well as increased costs for interest and depreciation 
noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
reconciliations of noi for the years ended december   and to net income for each year  are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income indirect operating expenses  net of corporate income investments and investment management expense expensed development and other pursuit costs interest expense  net gain loss on extinguishment of debt  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities depreciation expense impairment loss land holdings gain on sale of real estate assets income from discontinued operations net operating income the noi increases for both and  as compared to the prior year period  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands full year full year established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total the noi decrease in established communities in is due to the rental revenue declines as a result of the job losses experienced in and  coupled with increases in community operating expenses 
during  we focused on minimizing rental rate declines  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all regions 
we anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in such that overall rental revenue will decline between and 
the projected revenue decline is due to our expectation of continued job losses at least through the second quarter of expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth 
we expect operating expenses to be flat in from prior year levels 
as a result  we expect noi for our established communities to decline between and 
these projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in  both nationally and in the markets where we operate  as well as the individual demand supply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and or their impact on our operating results will be accurate  and actual results could differ materially 
please see risk factors  forward looking statements and other discussions in this report on form k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 
rental and other income increased in as compared to the prior year due to additional rental income generated from newly developed communities  offset somewhat by decreased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities 
rental and other income increased in as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities  coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  homes for and  homes for the increase in over is due to homes available from newly developed communities  offset partially by communities sold during  as well as declining occupancy levels due to the economic slow down 
the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  for as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue decreased  or  for and increased  or  for the decrease in from is due primarily to lower rental rates 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  compared to  in there was a slight change in year over year average economic occupancy for down to compared to in the increase in rental revenue in over the prior year is due entirely to increased average rental rates 
economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we experienced decreases in established communities rental revenue in all six of our regions for as compared to the prior year period as discussed in more detail below 
the metro new york new jersey region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue for  experienced a decrease in rental revenue of for as compared to average rental rates decreased to  and economic occupancy decreased to for as compared to during  the trend of weakening rental market conditions in both new york city and surrounding suburban markets resulting from the recession is reflected in the declining rental rates in the second half of the challenges facing the financial services industry drive the region s current expectation for job growth  which is expected to lag the us average and our other markets 
the mid atlantic midwest region  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced a decrease in rental revenue of as compared to average rental rates decreased by to  while economic occupancy increased by from to for as compared to this region continues to benefit from the impact of government and government services employment  which has served to stabilize the economy relative to other regions 
the new england region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue decrease of over the prior year 
average rental rates decreased to  and economic occupancy decreased to for  as compared to given the significance of the financial services industry in the boston metro area  as well as the impact of new york trends on fairfield new haven  we expect the job recovery to be slow 
northern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue decrease of over the prior year 
average rental rates decreased to  and economic occupancy decreased by to for as compared to the region s employment base  with its above average exposure to high technology industries  can result in greater volatility in rental revenue changes relative to other regions 
southern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue decrease of over the prior year 
average rental rates decreased to  and economic occupancy decreased by to for as compared to the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue decrease of over the prior year 
average rental rates decreased to  and economic occupancy decreased by to for as compared to the pacific northwest also has a large presence of technology based employment  a contributing factor to the greater degree of volatility in rental rates 
we believe a recovery in apartment fundamentals in the pacific northwest is likely to lag other avalonbay regions given an increased level of housing supply in many submarkets 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not comparable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a management  development and other fees increased  or  in and increased  or in the increase in was due primarily to increased asset and property management fees from fund ii 
the increase in was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by subsidiaries of fund i 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased  or in and increased  or for as compared to the prior year periods  primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes coupled with increased administrative expense due primarily to increases in bad debt expense due to the recession 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or to  for and  or to  for  due primarily to increased administrative and community maintenance related costs  offset partially by a decrease in insurance and utility related expenses 
the increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increased bad debt 
property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments 
property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 
for established communities  property taxes increased by  or and  or for and  respectively over the prior year  due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in that did not occur in the impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments  as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments 
we expect property taxes in to increase over due primarily to higher tax rates  without the benefit of lower assessed values 
for communities in california  property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index  with increases limited by law proposition 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  and also engage third party consultants to assist in our evaluations 
we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased by  or in and increased  or in over the prior year periods 
the decrease in over is due primarily to decreases in compensation costs  coupled with a reduction in costs associated with the initial start up of our customer care center  discussed below 
the increase in over the prior year is due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs  as well as costs relating to the initial start up of the customer care center and other corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities 
the customer care center in virginia beach  virginia opened in and expanded in to centralize certain community related accounting  administrative and customer service functions 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions and investment management 
investments and investment management costs decreased in by  or from the prior year due primarily to lower compensation and travel related costs 
expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits 
expensed development and other pursuit costs increased in as compared to and due to increases in abandoned development pursuits in response to the economic decline and deteriorating market conditions in these costs can be volatile  particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital  and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 
interest expense  net increased  or and  or in and  respectively over the prior years 
this category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized  and interest income 
the increase in is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in as compared to the prior year  coupled with increased interest expense in compared to from additional secured and unsecured debt issued to fund development activity 
the decrease in interest capitalized is due to the reduction in development activity in as compared to the increase in over the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in as compared to the prior year period  coupled with increased interest expense in compared to the higher level of interest income in is due to higher invested cash balances from our january equity offering 
the increased interest expense in is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in compared to the prior year 
gain loss on the extinguishment of debt  net reflects the impact of our debt repurchase activity for payments above or below the carrying basis 
the net loss in is due to the  in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium  offset by the gain recognized from our january tender offer 
depreciation expense increased in and primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities  offset by assets sold during the year 
general and administrative expense g a decreased  or in and increased  or in as compared to the prior years 
the increase in as compared to and is due primarily to higher severance and related costs in associated with the decrease in our planned development activity  higher federal excise tax expense in resulting from gains on disposition activity and organization costs for the formation of fund ii incurred in impairment loss for is due to the write down of three land parcels which we do not currently plan on developing 
impairment loss in is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we did not plan on developing at the time 
we did not recognize an impairment loss in gain on sale of land for increased primarily due to the sale of two land parcels in  without comparable activity in the prior year 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities for decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the recognition of our proportionate amount of an impairment loss that one of our unconsolidated investments recognized on one of its operating communities in in addition  gains from both the sale of a community by an unconsolidated joint venture as well as from an investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes occurred in that were not present in these amounts were partially offset by the recognition of our promoted interest in the joint venture that owns avalon chrystie place in the decrease in from the prior year is due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in and the related loss of partnership income  partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner  income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january  through december  this income decreased for and due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period 
see note  real estate disposition activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of communities decreased in and increased in as compared to the prior year periods as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year 
the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
net income loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for resulted in income of  compared to income of  in due primarily to recognition of income for our joint venture partners portion of expenses incurred by fund ii  as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in and  thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 
ffo ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance 
in calculating ffo  we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates 
ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistic payments  normal recurring operating expenses  downreit partnership unit distributions  and capital calls for fund ii  as required 
factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
during we saw access to liquidity improve as credit and equity markets recovered 
during  we raised in excess of  in the form of secured debt  unsecured debt and public and private equity 
in  we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources  including cash balances on hand  borrowing capacity under our credit facility as defined below  secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below  as well as our operating activities 
to the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs  we may seek additional external financing 
additional external financing could come from a variety of sources  such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders  among others 
private equity through joint ventures may also be used 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short term financial prospects 
at december   we have unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and cash in escrow of  available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities  of which  relates to a development right for which we have not begun construction 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate payables and the payment of interest amounts in as compared to investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development and redevelopment 
in total  we invested  during in the following areas we invested approximately  in the development of communities 
we had capital expenditures of  for real estate and non real estate assets 
these amounts are partially offset by the proceeds from the disposition of real estate of  financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled  in the net cash used is due primarily to the repayment of unsecured notes at maturity and repayment of amounts tendered of  the payment of cash dividends in the amount of  the repayment of amounts outstanding on the credit facility  defined below  of  and the repayment of secured notes of  these amounts were partially offset by the pooled secured financing executed in april for  the issuance of  aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in september and  received from the issuance of common stock  primarily through the continuous equity program the cep we initiated in august variable rate unsecured credit facility we currently have a  revolving variable rate credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in november assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
we pay an annual facility fee of approximately  the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit rating 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january  at january   there were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility   was used to provide letters of credit  and  was available for borrowing under the credit facility 
we expect to refinance the credit facility prior to maturity 
while credit market conditions continue to improve from the difficult environment seen in and  we expect facility pricing to be higher  and we may not be able to achieve the same borrowing capacity as exists under the current credit facility 
we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued 
the financial covenants include the following limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure  limitation on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property specific financing  and minimum levels of debt service coverage 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in addition  our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance  defeasance  or prepayment penalty provisions  which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity 
these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 
continuous equity offering program in august  we commenced the cep  under which we may sell up to  of our common stock 
this program is available until the  is sold or august  whichever occurs first 
we may sell the shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us 
actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us  including market conditions  the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding 
in conjunction with the cep  we engaged sales agents who received compensation of of the gross sales price for shares sold 
during the three months ended december  we sold  shares under this program at an average sales price of per share  for net proceeds of  during the year ended december   we sold  shares under this program at an average sales price of approximately per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity 
early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in and if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
the following financing activity occurred during we obtained secured financing for  pursuant to fourteen separate ten year mortgage loans  each secured by one of our current communities at an interest rate of  we obtained  in variable rate tax exempt bond financing related to a development right  the proceeds of which will be held in escrow until requisitioned for construction funding  we repaid  in fixed rate debt secured by a real estate asset formerly classified as a development right in alexandria  virginia in april pursuant to its scheduled maturity  we redeemed  principal amount of our  unsecured notes that mature in august for par and cancelled the notes upon purchase  we redeemed  principal amount of our  unsecured notes that mature in december for  with the discount below par recorded as a gain reflected in gain loss on extinguishment of debt  net on the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income of the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k and cancelled the notes upon purchase  we repaid  in unsecured debt  representing the first tranche of our  unsecured variable rate term loan pursuant to its scheduled maturity  we repaid  in variable rate debt secured by avalon at flanders hill  located in westborough  massachusetts pursuant to its scheduled maturity  we repaid  of previously issued unsecured notes  along with any unpaid interest  pursuant to their scheduled maturity  we repaid  in unsecured debt  representing the second tranche of our term loan prior to its scheduled maturity of january  we issued a total of  of unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement

we also had seven wholly owned communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of capital to fund ii  if or to the extent that fund ii makes capital calls in conjunction with additional community acquisitions during substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  development costs related to pursuing development rights  as well as for equity contributions to fund ii  will be funded from cash currently on hand  including cash in construction escrows  invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  and short term investment vehicles  the remaining capacity under our  credit facility  retained operating cash  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding  including joint venture activity 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the funds  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities  we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest 
additional discussion of these entities can be found in note  investments in real estate entities  of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report

as part of the construction management services we provided to phvp i  llc for the construction of the public garage  we provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing  which occurred in the third quarter of our obligations under this guarantee therefore  have terminated and we have no further obligation under this agreement 
in we entered into a non cancelable commitment the commitment to acquire parcels of land in brooklyn  new york for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  under the terms of the commitment  we are closing on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller s ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this commitment 
however  under no circumstances will the commitment extend beyond  at which time either we or the seller can compel execution of the remaining transactions 
at december   we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately there are no other lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us

contractual obligations in  we entered into a lease agreement for office space in arlington  virginia 
the office space will serve as our corporate headquarters  with relocation scheduled to occur in the first half of the lease has a ten year lease term  with extension rights  with rent of approximately  annually 
we are marketing for lease or sale the building that serves as our current headquarters in alexandria  virginia 
aside from this lease  there have not been any other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes land leases expiring between october and march amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements  applying the applicable accounting guidance 
for investment interests that we do not consolidate  we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply 
the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
therefore  we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december   our assets would have increased by  and our liabilities would have increased by  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed  including but not limited to the following reasons  none of which are currently expected to occur for entities not considered to be variable interest entities  the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary 
for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and or variable interest  the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and or variable interest 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
for redevelopment efforts  we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed  or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities 
these costs include interest and related loan fees  property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs 
interest is capitalized for any project specific financing  as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects 
indirect project costs  which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts  are also capitalized 
the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and  as such  we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity 
if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  there may be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if in our development activities decreased by  and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs  our operating expenses would have increased by  we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community  and therefore should be capitalized  the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate 
if we had determined that of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring  net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by abandoned pursuit costs asset impairment we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable 
future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and the availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development by us no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits  which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits  in the amounts of  in and  in these costs are included in operating expenses  excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly  and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 
during  we concluded that the continued economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning 
this resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of  related to the impairment of two land parcels which we currently do not intend to develop 
we looked to third party pricing estimates to determine the fair values of the land parcels considered to be impaired 
given the heterogeneous nature of multifamily real estate  the third party values incorporated significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore considered to be level prices in the fair value hierarchy 
in addition  in we recognized a further impairment charge of  on a land parcel for which an earlier impairment had been recognized in the fourth quarter of the additional impairment charge reduces our carrying basis to its current estimated selling price less costs to dispose 
our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed  or the likelihood of any future impairment charges  if any 
you should also review item a  risk factors of this form k 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
for example  if we failed to qualify as a reit in  our net income would have decreased by approximately  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment 
therefore  we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates 
we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily  in short term libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives  as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate borrowings to effective floating rate notes 
in addition  we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings  or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing 
further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements and including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
as of december   we had executed interest rate swap agreements to hedge cash flow variability for approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt and executed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately  of our fixed rate unsecured notes 
had these interest rate swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  higher and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on hedged floating rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  higher and  lower  respectively 
because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  contractual fixed rate debt represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by
