current year acquisitions  dispositions  repositionings and financings 
acquisitions 
we did not acquire any new properties in dispositions 
in connection with the initial closing of fund x in october  we i contributed to fund x the portfolio of six class a office properties that we acquired in march and ii transferred to fund x the related million term loan 
in exchange  we received an interest in the common equity of fund x 
because the net value of the contributed properties as valued under the fund x operating agreement exceeded our required capital contribution  fund x distributed cash to us for the excess 
we received part of the cash in october and the remainder at the end of february  at which point fund x became an unconsolidated real estate fund in which we retained an equity investment 
we recognized a gain of million in the first quarter of on the disposition of the interest in fund x we did not retain 
the results of operations for each of the acquired properties are included in our consolidated statements of operations only from the date of each acquisition  and in the case of the properties contributed to fund x  only until the end of february  when the properties were deconsolidated from our financial statements 
beginning in february  we have accounted for our interest in fund x under the equity method 
repositionings 
we generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it 
we often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near term lease roll over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to determine the optimal use and tenant mix 
a repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property 
a repositioning may involve a complete structural renovation of a building to significantly upgrade the character of the property  or it may involve targeted remodeling of common areas and tenant spaces to make the property more attractive to certain identified tenants 
because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property  tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket  the results are varying degrees of depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels for the affected property  which impacts our results and  accordingly  comparisons of our performance from period to period 
the repositioning process generally occurs over the course of months or even years 
although usually associated with newly acquired properties  repositioning efforts can also occur at properties we already own  therefore repositioning properties discussed in the context of this paragraph exclude acquisition properties where the plan for improvement is implemented as part of the acquisition 
during  we had no properties that qualify as repositioning properties 
financings 
during  we exercised a one year extension option and renewed our revolving credit facility for million reduced from million  but on the same pricing and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as prior to the extension 
a second one year extension option remains available 
we also exercised a one year extension option on the million variable rate loan held by a consolidated joint venture 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the three years ended december   and are the consolidated financial statements of douglas emmett  inc and our subsidiaries including our operating partnership 
as described under dispositions above  the results of the six properties we acquired in march were included in our consolidated results until the end of february  when we completed the transaction to contribute these properties to fund x in return for an equity interest 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission sec 
the accompanying financial statements include  in our opinion  all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the financial information set forth therein 
any reference to the number of properties and square footage are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the united states public company accounting oversight board 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of douglas emmett  inc and our predecessor are based upon their respective consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events  for example with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings  improvements  equipment  and any related intangible assets and liabilities 
these determinations  even though inherently subjective and subject to change  affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
while we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made  some of our assumptions  estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect 
as a result  actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals  and those differences positive or negative could be material 
some of our accruals are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available 
investment in real estate 
acquisitions of properties and other business combinations are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
beginning january   transaction costs related to acquisitions are expensed  rather than included with the consideration paid 
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  buildings and improvements  equipment and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in place at market leases  acquired above and below market leases and tenant relationships 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than months from the acquisition date 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases 
the fair values of tangible assets are determined on an as if vacant basis 
the as if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the estimated fair value of acquired in place at market leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition 
such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions and legal costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level 
additionally  we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and we include an estimate of the net operating costs primarily real estate taxes  insurance and utilities incurred during the lease up period  which is generally six months 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded as an asset or liability based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received or paid pursuant to the in place tenant or ground leases  respectively  and our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant improvements are capitalized 
interest  insurance and property tax costs incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
when assets are sold or retired  their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period 
the values allocated to land  buildings  site improvements  tenant improvements  and in place leases are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for buildings  years for site improvements  a portfolio average term  per building  of existing leases for in place lease values and the respective remaining lease terms for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
the values of above and below market tenant leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market tenant leases or a decrease for above market tenant leases to rental income 
the value of above and below market ground leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market ground leases or a decrease for above market ground leases to office rental operating expense 
the amortization of acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment in real estate or an investment in an unconsolidated real estate fund  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property or equity investment 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
income taxes 
as a reit  we are permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders  eliminating the federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the corporate level 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
revenue recognition 
four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
for all lease terms exceeding one year  rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis in excess of billed rents 
lease termination fees  which are included in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  common are maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred 
subsequent to year end  we perform final reconciliations on a lease by lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments 
in addition  we record a capital asset for leasehold improvements constructed by us that are reimbursed by tenants  with the offsetting side of this accounting entry recorded to deferred revenue which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the deferred revenue is amortized as additional rental revenue over the life of the related lease 
rental revenue from month to month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned 
the recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires that we measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction  as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  profit sharing or leasing method 
if the sales criteria have been met  we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method 
if the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met  we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances 
monitoring of rents and other receivables 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
we generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants  other than security deposits or letters of credit 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
stock based compensation 
we have awarded stock based compensation to certain key employees and members of our board of directors in the form of stock options and long term incentive plan units ltip units 
we estimate the fair value of the awards and recognize this value over the requisite vesting period 
we utilize a black scholes model to calculate the fair value of options  which uses assumptions related to the stock  including volatility and dividend yield  as well as assumptions related to the stock award itself  such as the expected term and estimated forfeiture rate 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions for which we have relied on observations of both historical trends and implied estimates as determined by independent third parties 
for ltip units  the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant and a discount for post vesting restrictions estimated by a third party consultant 
financial instruments 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments are determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges 
interest rate agreements 
we manage our interest rate risk associated with borrowings by obtaining interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
no other derivative instruments are used 
we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  which is a component of our stockholders equity accounts 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings

results of operations the comparability of our results of operations between  and is affected by acquisitions in all years presented 
this includes the acquisition of two office properties during and the acquisition of seven office properties during six of the seven properties acquired in were subsequently contributed to a real estate fund and were removed from our consolidated results at the end of february  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
for most of the comparisons of to below  the majority of the fluctuation is explained by the inclusion of these six properties in our consolidated results for the nine months subsequent to their acquisition in comparison to only two months of  when they were removed from our consolidation 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue office revenue total office revenue 
total office revenue consists of rental revenue  tenant recoveries and parking and other income 
for the reasons described below  total office revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for rental revenue 
rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties  percentage rent on the retail space contained within office properties  and lease termination income 
total office rental revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million less rent in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  partially offset by increases totaling million for the remainder of our portfolio 
the increase of million is a result of rate increases for new and renewal tenants  partially offset by lower occupancy 
tenant recoveries 
total office tenant recoveries decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million less recoveries in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  partially offset by an increase in recoverable tenant direct expenses 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million less parking income in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  as well as a decrease of million for the remainder of our portfolio as a result of lower occupancy and usage 
multifamily revenue total multifamily revenue 
total multifamily revenue consists of rent  parking income and other income 
total multifamily revenue decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to lower recognition of rental income during from the amortization of below market leases for certain multifamily units initially recorded at the time of our ipo  thus causing a decline when comparing the and periods  as well as a decline in rental rates for the comparable periods 
operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expense decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million less in office rental expenses in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  partially offset by an increase in office rental expenses in the remainder of our portfolio 
other office expenses increased by million primarily as a result of lower comparable property tax accruals in the prior year  partially offset by lower janitorial costs and ground rent payments in the current year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to the timing of accruals related to compensation  including equity awards that are expensed over the multi year vesting period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million less depreciation and amortization reflected in compared to resulting from the six properties we contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund 
non operating income and expenses gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated real estate fund 
in february  we recorded a gain of million related to the contribution of six properties to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income loss 
other income loss reflects a net loss in which represents the allocation to outside ownership interest of profit generated by the six properties owned by fund x during the two months of prior to the deconsolidation of fund x  net of the profit generated by our management of the properties during the ten months of following the deconsolidation of fund x 
in contrast  the other income loss in reflects a net gain of million  which includes million of profit sharing resulting from our initial contribution of the six properties in october to fund x  which was deconsolidated in february  as well as million of operating profit related to the temporary operation of the honolulu athletic club during loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate fund 
the loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate fund totaled million for the loss represents our equity interest in the operating results from the six properties owned by fund x  including the operating income net of historical cost basis depreciation 
during  subsequent to acquiring the six properties  the operating results were contained in our consolidated results  so there was no comparable amount recorded in this line until the properties were deconsolidated at the end of february interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease over comparable periods is primarily due to lower levels of outstanding debt during as a result of the deconsolidation of debt associated with the six properties contributed to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund  and a decrease in the utilization of our revolving credit facility during the current year  which had no outstanding borrowings for the majority of the decrease is partially offset by additional interest expense as a result of higher non cash interest expense from the amortization of pre ipo interest rate swap contracts 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue office revenue total office revenue 
total office revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for for the reasons described below 
rental revenue 
total office rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is due to million of incremental rent from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as increases in average rental rates for new and renewal leases across our existing office portfolio 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incremental revenues of million from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as increases in parking rates implemented across the portfolio and increases in ground rent income 
multifamily revenue total multifamily revenue 
total multifamily revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million in amortization of below market leases for certain multifamily units initially recorded at the time of our ipo and formation that were fully amortized during the second quarter of  thus causing a decline when comparing to this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million resulting from increased occupancy and an increase in rents charged to both new and existing tenants  including increases for select santa monica multifamily units 
these units were under leases signed prior to a change in california law that allows landlords to reset rents to market rates when a tenant moves out 
therefore  a portion of the multifamily increase was due to the rollover to market rents of several of these rent controlled units  or pre units  since january  operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to million of incremental operating expenses from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of the increase was offset by a net reduction in various operating expenses in our existing portfolio  consisting primarily of lower property tax accruals offset by higher utility expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization of million from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as the finalization of the purchase price allocation and related lives of real estate assets combined at the time of our ipo formation transactions 
non operating income and expenses other income loss 
other income loss of million in consisted of interest income earned on the investment of excess cash 
in  other income loss of million consisted primarily of interest income and the allocation of operating results related to fund x  as well as miscellaneous income from the temporary operation of the honolulu athletic club during see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase for the comparable periods was primarily due to an increase in outstanding borrowings during to fund property acquisitions  including the six properties acquired in march that were contributed to fund x in october  and for general corporate purposes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of the report 
liquidity and capital resources available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources in october  we completed the initial closing of fund x 
fund x has obtained equity commitments in excess of million  of which we committed million and certain of our officers committed million on the same terms as the other investors 
fund x contemplates an investment period of up to four years from the initial closing  followed by a ten year value creation period 
with limited exceptions  fund x will be our exclusive investment vehicle during its investment period  using the same underwriting and leverage principles and focusing primarily on the same markets as we have 
see note  note  and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we had total indebtedness of billion at december   excluding a loan premium representing the mark to market adjustment on variable rate debt assumed from our predecessor 
our debt decreased million from december  primarily as a result of our contribution of six properties to fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund and the related million of debt which the properties secure as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the remaining decrease in our outstanding debt was the result of repaying all outstanding amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we have a secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks led by bank of america  na and banc of america securities llc totaling million 
at december   there were no borrowing outstanding under this credit facility 
this revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either libor plus basis points or federal funds rate plus basis points if the amount outstanding is million or less 
however  if the amount outstanding is greater than million  the credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either libor plus basis points or federal funds rate plus basis points 
the facility is scheduled to mature on october  but has a one year extension available to us 
in the current economic environment and credit market  there is a chance that we may not meet the criteria necessary to utilize the extension  or the availability under the facility may be reduced upon extension 
we have used our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including acquisition funding  redevelopment and repositioning opportunities  tenant improvements and capital expenditures  share equivalent repurchases  recapitalizations and working capital 
we have historically financed our capital needs through short term lines of credit and long term secured mortgages of which have been at floating rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements 
at december   billion or of our debt was effectively fixed at an overall rate of on an actual day basis by virtue of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements in place at the end of the reporting period 
however  of the billion of variable rate debt swapped to fixed rates  certain underlying swaps totaling billion are scheduled to mature on august  and certain other underlying swaps totaling million are scheduled to mature on december  see item a of this report for a description of the impact of variable rates on our interest expense 
see also note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
at december   our total borrowings under secured loans represented of our total market capitalization of billion 
total market capitalization includes our consolidated debt and the value of common stock and operating partnership units each based on our common stock closing price at december  on the new york stock exchange of per share 
the nature of our business  and the requirements imposed by reit rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis  will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
in  we declared an annual dividend of per share  paid quarterly following the end of each quarter 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through cash provided by operations and  if necessary  by drawing upon our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions  redevelopment and repositioning of properties  non recurring capital expenditures  and repayment of indebtedness at maturity 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of these long term cash requirements 
we will seek to satisfy these needs through cash flows from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of debt and equity securities  including units in our operating partnership  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we have historically financed our operations  acquisitions and development  through the use of our revolving credit facility or other short term acquisition lines of credit  which we subsequently repay with long term secured floating rate mortgage debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements at the time we enter into term borrowings 
commitments the following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations minimum lease payments remaining capital commitment to fund x purchase commitments related to capital expenditures associated with tenant improvements and repositioning and other purchase obligations total includes million of debt carried by the honolulu club joint venture in which we held a interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had an equity investment of million in fund x  an unconsolidated real estate fund 
we formed fund x to raise additional capital to allow us to make acquisitions of properties 
we have an interest in fund x that is pari passu with the other investors in fund x based on our capital contributions and we have a remaining capital commitment of million at december  in addition  during the life of fund x  we are entitled to certain additional distributions based on committed capital and on any profits that exceed certain specified cash returns to the investors 
certain of our wholly owned affiliates provide property management and other services to fund x  for which we are paid fees and or reimbursed our costs 
in connection with the initial closing of fund x in october  we i contributed to fund x the portfolio of six class a office properties that we acquired in march and ii transferred to fund x the related million term loan 
in exchange  we received an interest in the common equity of fund x 
because the net value of the contributed properties as valued under the fund x operating agreement exceeded our required capital contribution  fund x distributed cash to us for the excess 
we received part of the cash in october and the remainder at the end of february we recognized a gain of million in the first quarter of on the disposition of the interest in fund x we did not retain 
we do not expect to receive additional significant liquidity from our investment in fund x until the disposition of the properties held by fund x  which may not be for many years 
we do not have any debt outstanding in connection with our interest in fund x 
fund x has debt outstanding  which is secured by the six properties we contributed  totaling million at december  as summarized in the following table type of debt maturity date variable rate effective annual fixed rate swap maturity date variable rate term loan swapped to fixed rate libor includes the effect of interest rate contracts 
based on actual day basis and excludes amortization of loan fees 
the total effective rate on an actual day basis is at december  the loan is secured by six properties in a collateralized pool 
requires monthly payments of interest only  with outstanding principal due upon maturity 
we remain responsible under certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non recourse carve outs under these loans which we entered into prior to our contribution of this debt and the related properties to fund x  although we have an indemnity from fund x for any amounts we would be required to pay under these agreements 
if fund x fails to perform any obligations under a swap agreement related to this loan  we remain liable to the swap counterparties 
the maximum future payments under the swap agreements was approximately million as of december  to date  all obligations under the swap agreements have been performed by fund x in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
our cash flows from operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio  the rental rates achieved on our leases  the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating expenses and other general and administrative costs 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to the cash flows from properties contributed to fund x were included in our consolidated results for nine months of compared to only two months of see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions  development and redevelopment projects and recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to the absence of property acquisitions in compared to see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our net cash related to financing activities is generally impacted by our borrowings  capital activities net of dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests 
net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net use of cash for totaling million compared to a net provision of cash for totaling million 
the primary differences are the repayment of debt in compared to increased borrowings in for property acquisitions  partially offset by lower dividends and distributions in and a lower level of operating partnership unit redemptions in compared to see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
in conjunction with our ipo  we entered into two new series of interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
the first series effectively offset all future changes in fair value from our existing interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts  and the second series effectively replaced the existing interest rate contracts and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting 
we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
for a description of our interest rate contracts  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained item of in this report 
as of december   approximately or billion of our total outstanding debt of billion  excluding loan premiums  was subject to floating interest rates which were effectively fixed by virtue of interest rate contracts 
the remaining million of debt held by a consolidated joint venture in which we own a two thirds interest  bears interest at a floating rate and was not mitigated by interest rate contracts 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding at december   by virtue of the mitigating effect of our interest rate contracts  a basis point change in libor would result in an annual impact to earnings of approximately thousand 
however  of the billion of variable rate debt swapped to fixed rates  certain underlying swaps totaling billion are scheduled to mature on august  and certain other underlying swaps totaling million are scheduled to mature on december  if we chose to not enter into new swaps covering the remaining term of the hedged debt  the potential impact to earnings of a basis point change in libor would be an additional million 
as of december   approximately or billion of our total outstanding debt of billion  excluding loan premiums  was subject to floating interest rates which were effectively fixed by virtue of interest rate contracts 
the remaining million  including million of debt held by a consolidated joint venture in which we own a two thirds interest  bears interest at a floating rate and was not mitigated by interest rate contracts 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding at december   by virtue of the mitigating effect of our interest rate contracts  a basis point change in libor would result in an annual impact to earnings of approximately thousand 
we calculate interest sensitivity by computing the amount of floating rate debt not mitigated by interest rate contracts by the respective change in rate 
the sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration possible changes in the balances or fair value of our floating rate debt 
by using derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk and the potential inability of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we attempt to minimize this credit risk by contracting with high quality bank financial counterparties
