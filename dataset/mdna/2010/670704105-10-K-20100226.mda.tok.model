item business 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  a market estimated to exceed billion in the united states in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as a growing offering of cervical  biologics and motion preservation products 
in the spine surgery market  our currently marketed products are primarily used to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures  and develop motion preserving products such as our total disc replacement products 
we dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
currently  we are training approximately to surgeons annually  which includes surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
our mas platform combines four categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  biologics includes our formagraft and osteocel line of products  and specialized implants includes our spherx and armada tm pedicle screw systems  coroent suite of implants  and several fixation systems 
we believe our mas platform provides a unique and comprehensive solution for safe and reproducible minimally disruptive surgical treatment of spine disorders by enabling surgeons to access the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and avoidance of critical nerves 
the fundamental difference between our mas platform 
table of contents and what has been previously named mis  or minimally invasive surgery  is the ability to customize safe and reproducible access to the spine while allowing surgeons to continue to use instruments that are familiar to them 
simply stated  the mas platform does not force surgeons to reinvent approaches that add complexity and undermine safety  ease and efficacy 
an important ongoing objective has been to maintain a leading position in access and nerve avoidance  as well as being the leader and pioneer in lateral surgery 
our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by neurovision  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and our neurovision system allows surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
we believe that the procedures facilitated by our mas platform reduce operating times  decrease trauma and blood loss  and lead to faster overall patient recovery times compared to open spine surgery 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as in the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
in  we acquired cervitech  inc  a company focused on clinical approval of the pcm cervical disc system  a motion preserving total disc replacement device 
this strategic acquisition allows us the potential to accelerate our entry into the growing mechanical cervical disc replacement market 
currently  the pcm investigational device has reached the two year follow up end point in its us food and drug administration fda approved clinical trial in the united states 
approval  if obtained  will further strengthen our cervical product offering and will enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 
our biologic offering includes formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process  and osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 
in  we invested in progentix orthobiology  bv  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands involved in the development of osteoinductive bone graft material technology 
as part of the investment transaction  we became the exclusive distributor for certain progentix biologic products 
our corporate headquarters are located in san diego  california 
we lease approximately  square feet in san diego 
our headquarters has a six suite state of the art cadaver operating theatre designed to accommodate the training of spine surgeons 
our primary distribution and warehousing operations are located in our facility in memphis  tennessee 
our business requires overnight delivery of products and surgical instruments for almost all surgeries involving our products 
because of its location and proximity to overnight third party transporters  our memphis facility has greatly enhanced our ability to meet demanding delivery schedules and provide a greater level of customer service 
recent product introductions in the last few years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products and marked our entrance into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
our newly launched and acquired products are highlighted by the following products implants our implant products  which include among other implants the coroent family of products and our spherx and armada pedicle screw systems  have historically focused on the lumbar spine  with our recent and planned product introductions  such as vuepoint oct and thoracic xlif  we will increasingly address the cervical and thoracic spine as well 
neurovision m tm is  along with its predecessors  the enabling technology for the xlif procedure  and utilizes proprietary technology and hunting algorithms to locate and avoid critical nerves during spine surgery 
neurovision m s name refers to five monitoring modalities  covering the entire spine  available in this enhanced version of our technology  which include i stimulated electromyography emg  ii free run emg  iii motor evoked potentials meps  iv somatosensory evoked potentials sseps  and v navigated guidance 

table of contents biologics in we expanded our biologics offering by acquiring osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mscs to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early we made an investment in progentix orthobiology  bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic osteoinductive bone graft material 
this investment includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology  bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
our strategy our objective is to become a leading provider of creative medical products that provide comprehensive solutions for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
we are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective establish our mas platform as a standard of care 
we believe our mas platform has the potential to become the standard of care for spine surgery as spine surgeons continue to adopt our products and recognize their benefits 
we also believe that our mas platform has the potential to dramatically improve the clinical results of spine surgery 
we dedicate significant resources to educating spine surgeons on the clinical benefits of our products  and we intend to capitalize on patient demand for minimally disruptive surgical alternatives 
continue to develop and introduce new creative products 
one of our core competencies is our ability to develop and commercialize creative spine surgery products 
in the past three years  we have introduced more than new products and product enhancements 
we have several additional products currently under development that should expand our presence in fusion surgery as well as provide an entry into the motion preservation market segment 
we intend to accomplish this with an unwavering commitment to our mas platform and building on our core technology 
we believe that these additional products will allow us to generate  on average  greater revenues per spine surgery procedure while improving patient care 
expand the reach of our exclusive sales force 
we believe that having a sales force dedicated to selling only our spine surgery products is critical to achieve continued growth across product lines  greater market penetration and increased sales 
in  we completed our transition to an exclusive sales force  and we have seen the benefits of that effort 
our us sales force is achieving deeper penetration in our accounts and further establishing nuvasive as a technology leader in the spine industry 
in the united states  our exclusive sales force is managed by an executive vice president and four area vice presidents  each of whom is responsible for a geographic region of the country 
each area vice president is responsible for sales directors  who in turn are responsible for area business managers  or abms  who are nuvasive shareowners our employees responsible for a defined territory 
the remainder of the us sales force are both direct our shareowners and exclusive independent sales representatives or exclusive distributor agents  each acting as our sole representative and selling only nuvasive spine products in a given territory 
provide tailored solutions in response to surgeon needs 
responding quickly to the needs of spine surgeons  which we refer to as absolute responsiveness  is central to our corporate culture  critical to our success and  we believe  differentiates us from our competition 
we solicit information and feedback from our surgeon customers and clinical advisors regarding the utility of  and potential improvements  to our products 
for example  we have an on site machine shop to allow us to rapidly manufacture product prototypes and a state of the art cadaver operating theatre to provide clinical training and validate new ideas through prototype testing 
selectively license or acquire complementary spine products and technologies 
in addition to building our company through internal product development efforts  we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies that we believe will keep us on the forefront of innovation 
by acquiring complementary products  we believe we can leverage our expertise at bringing new products to market that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  shorten procedures  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 

table of contents industry background and market the spine is the core of the human skeleton  and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility 
it consists of separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue to permit a normal range of motion 
the spinal cord  the body s central nerve conduit  is enclosed within the spinal column 
vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints two facet joints and one spine disc 
the four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions  deformities  trauma and tumors 
the largest market  and the focus of our business historically  is degenerative conditions of the facet joints and disc space 
these conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column  causing back pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs 
in the us  over million people suffer from some type of chronic back pain 
the prescribed treatment depends on the severity and duration of the disorder 
initially  physicians will prescribe non operative  conservative procedures including bed rest  medication  lifestyle modification  exercise  physical therapy  chiropractic care and steroid injections 
in most cases  non operative treatment options are effective  however  some patients require spine fusion surgery 
it is estimated that over  spine fusion procedures are performed annually  and the vast majority are done using traditional open surgical techniques from either an anterior or posterior approach 
these traditional open surgical approaches require a large incision in the patient s abdomen or back in order to enable the surgeon to see the spine and surrounding area 
most open procedures are invasive  lengthy and complex  and may result in significant blood loss  extensive dissection of tissue and lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation 
back pain is one of the leading causes of healthcare expenditures in the united states  with a direct cost of more than billion annually for diagnosis  treatment and rehabilitation 
the us market for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  the focus of our business  was estimated to be over billion in and is estimated to grow to over billion in we believe that the implant market for spine surgery procedures will continue to grow because of the following market dynamics increased use of implants 
the use of implants has evolved into the standard of care in spine surgery 
over the past five years  there has been a significant increase in the percentage of spine fusion surgeries using implants and we estimate that over of all spine fusion surgeries now involve implants 
demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption 
as with other surgical markets  we anticipate that the broader acceptance of surgical treatments with less tissue disruption will result in increased demand for these types of surgical procedures 
increasing demand for motion preserving treatments 
motion preserving treatments potentially offer earlier intervention in the degenerative disease process for many patients 
favorable demographics 
the population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging baby boomers  people born between and we believe this population segment will demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery than prior generations 
surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption the benefits of minimally invasive surgery procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption of the spine 
surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative complications  shorter surgery times and decreased hospitalization 
at the same time  patients seek procedures that cause less trauma and allow for faster recovery times 
despite these benefits  the rate of adoption of surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption procedures has been relatively slow with respect to the spine 
we believe the two principal factors contributing to spine surgeons slow adoption of traditional minimally invasive spine alternatives are i the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy  and ii the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures 
most traditional minimally invasive spine systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope  while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques 
in 
table of contents addition  most traditional minimally invasive spine systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of trial cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system 
the nuvasive solution maximum access surgery mas our mas platform allows surgeons to perform a wide range of minimally disruptive procedures  while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical techniques 
we believe our products improve clinical results and have both the potential to expand the number of minimally disruptive procedures performed and become a standard of care in spine fusion and non fusion surgery 
our mas platform combines four product categories neurovision  maxcess  biologics and specialized implants 
neurovision enables surgeons to navigate around nerves while maxcess affords direct customized access to the spine for implant delivery 
maxcess also allows surgeons to use well established traditional instruments in a minimally disruptive and less traumatic manner while our biologics offering compliments our mas platform by facilitating fusion 
we also offer a variety of specialized implants that enable sufficient structural support while conforming to the anatomical requirements of the patient 
our products facilitate minimally disruptive applications of the following spine surgery procedures  among others lumbar fusion procedures in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient s back or abdomen  decompression  which is removal of a portion of bone over the nerve root or disc from under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve  and procedures designed to correct and or stabilize the spine while simultaneously maintaining motion 
importantly  our products also enable innovative procedures such as the xlif 
the xlif procedure  which we developed with leading spine surgeons  allows surgeons to access the spine from the side of the patient s body rather than from the front or back  which results in less operating time and reduced patient trauma and blood loss 
mas neurovision neurovision utilizes electromyography  or emg  proprietary algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced nerve avoidance system 
our system functions by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups  which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity 
we connect the instruments that surgeons use to a computer system that provides real time feedback during surgery 
our system analyzes and then translates complex neurophysiologic data into simple  useful information to assist the surgeon s clinical decision making process 
for example  during a pedicle screw test  in which the integrity of the bone where the implant is placed is tested  if the insertion of a screw results in a breach of the bone  a red light and corresponding numeric value will result so that the surgeon may reposition the implant to avoid potential nerve impingement or irritation 
if no breach of the bone occurs  a green light and corresponding numeric value will result 
surgeons can dynamically link familiar surgical instruments to neurovision  thus creating an interactive set of instruments that enable the safe navigation of neural anatomy 
the connection is accomplished using a clip that is attached to the instrument  effectively providing the benefits of neurovision through an instrument already familiar to the surgeon 
the system s proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interface enables the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time resulting in safer and faster procedures with the potential for improved patient outcomes 
with recent additions  the health and integrity of the spinal cord can also be assessed using motor evoked potentials meps and somatosensory evoked potentials sseps 
both methods of intraoperative monitoring involve applying stimulation and recording the response that must travel along the motor or sensory aspect of the spinal cord 
the data developed using neurovision can now be sent to health care professionals for additional interpretation of intraoperative information via networking capabilities and software that allows real time assessment from remote locations 

table of contents mas maxcess our maxcess system consists of instrumentation and specialized implants that provide maximum access to the spine with minimal soft tissue disruption 
maxcess has a split blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to build the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the fixed tube design of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical systems 
maxcess split blade design also provides expanded access to the spine  which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a significantly smaller incision 
the ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve and facilitates the adoption of our products 
our system s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with direct visualization of the patient s anatomy  without the need for additional technology or other special equipment 
over the years  several improvements to our maxcess systems have been made  including incorporating nerve avoidance technology with the use of neurovision  superior and inferior blades that kick out at an angle to spread the tissue closest to the pathology point further than prior versions  and a removable fourth blade  which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted blade locking mechanism 
further  our maxcess products are used in the cervical spine for posterior application  the lumbar spine for decompression  transforaminal interbody fusion  or tlif  fusion and have been used in the thoracic region as the lateral approach has broadened from the lumbar to the thoracic region as well as into adult degenerative scoliosis procedures 
mas specialized implants we have a number of implants designed to be used with our mas platform 
these implants are used for interbody disc height restoration for fusion and stabilization of the spine 
our implants are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate the anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure 
our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion 
our fixation systems have been uniquely designed to be delivered through our maxcess system to provide stabilization of the spine 
these systems enable minimally disruptive placement of implants and are intended to reduce operating time and patient morbidity  often through a single approach 
we also made significant progress in the last few years on our research and development initiatives related to motion preservation 
the pcm clinical trial is complete and the trial protocol requires a two year follow up period  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  on all patients before submitting to the fda for potential approval 
we anticipate submitting for fda approval in the first quarter of the clinical trial for neodisc  a nucleus like total disc replacement device  is a prospective  randomized  controlled  multi center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neodisc by comparing the outcomes of patients to traditional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion 
enrollment began in the third quarter of and is now complete 
our motion preservation product development efforts also include our mechanical lateral total disc replacement xl tdr tm 
we filed with the fda for investigational device exemptions  or ides  on the xl tdr in late and were granted an ide in mas biologics as part of our mas offering  we have expanded our product offerings in the last few years to include products in the biologics market 
the biologics market in spine surgery has grown to approximately billion and consists of autograft autologous human tissue  allograft donated human tissue  a varied offering of synthetic products  stem cell based products  and growth factors 
we made our initial entry into this market in by acquiring rights to formagraft  a collagen based synthetic product 
we expanded this offering in by acquiring osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mscs to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early  we made an investment in progentix orthobiology  bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic osteoinductive bone graft material 

table of contents development projects we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications 
these devices are intended to allow surgeons to address a patient s pain and dysfunction while maintaining normal range of motion and avoiding future adjacent level degeneration that can occur after spine fusion 
commercialization of these devices  including pcm  neodisc  and xl tdr  will require premarket approval rather than k clearance 
in the cervical spine  the pcm investigational device  a total disc replacement device designed to preserve motion  has reached the two year follow up end point in its fda approved clinical trial in the united states 
we anticipate submitting for fda approval in the first quarter of approval  if obtained  of pcm will further strengthen our cervical product offering and will enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 
also in the cervical spine  patient enrollment in the fda approved clinical trial of the neodisc nucleus like total disc replacement device in the united states is complete 
the neodisc study s two year follow up period is scheduled for completion in late our lumbar motion preservation development efforts include xl tdr  a mechanical total disc replacement implanted through the xlif approach 
enrollment in an fda approved xl tdr clinical trial in the united states was initiated in and will continue throughout in addition to the motion preservation platforms previously mentioned  we continue development on a wide variety of projects intended to broaden surgical applications such as with tumor  trauma  and deformity  and increase fixation options for greater vertical integration of our mas techniques 
we also continue expanding our cervical product portfolio to provide for a comprehensive cervical offering that will include segmentation of both the fixation and motion preservation markets 
research and development our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing further enhancements to our existing products  launching new product categories  as well as developing our total disc products 
as of december   our research staff consists of shareowners employees  including six who hold phd degrees and three who hold other advanced degrees 
our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathology and this group continues to work closely with our clinical advisors and spine surgeon customers to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  shorten procedures  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 
sales and marketing in the united states  we currently sell our products through a combination of exclusive independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives employed by us 
importantly  both our direct sales representatives as well as our independent sales agencies are exclusive and sell only nuvasive spine surgery products 
each member of our us sales force is responsible for a defined territory  with our independent sales representatives acting as our sole representative in their respective territories 
the determination of whether to engage a directly employed shareowner or exclusive distributor is made on a territory by territory basis  with a focus on the candidate who brings the best skills and experience 
currently  the split between directly employed and independent sales agents in our sales force is roughly equal 
outside the united states  we currently sell our products through a combination of exclusive distributors and direct sales representatives employed by us 
the transition to an exclusive sales force has been a very positive contributor to our growth in sales 
there are many reasons that we believe strongly in an exclusive sales force  none more important than having a sales force that is properly trained and incentivized to sell and represent only our portfolio of products 
our global sales force is managed by three executive vice presidents managing the following territories asia pacific  emea europe  middle east and africa and the americas 
the executive vice president of the americas manages four area vice presidents 
each area vice president is responsible for a portion of the united states and manages the directly employed and independent sales agents engaged in that territory 
outside of the united states  the executive vice presidents manage directly employed sales agents and independent distributors in that territory 

table of contents surgeon training and education nuvasive devotes significant resources to training and educating surgeons regarding the safety and reproducibility of our surgical techniques and our complimentary instruments and implants 
we maintain a state of the art cadaver operating theatre and training facility at our corporate headquarters to help promote adoption of our products 
currently  we are training approximately to surgeons annually in the xlif technique and our other mas platform products including neurovision  maxcess and specialized implants 
nuvasive has also helped to establish solas  the society of lateral access surgery  a group of spine surgeons dedicated to the development and expanded application of lateral spine surgery techniques that offer significant patient benefits and improved clinical outcome through peer to peer communication  clinical education efforts  and research 
the number of surgeons trained annually includes first time surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
manufacturing and supply we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products  their components and servicing 
we currently maintain alternative manufacturing sources for some components of neurovision  maxcess  and spherx  as well as some of our other finished goods products 
we have and are in the process of identifying and qualifying additional suppliers for our highest volume products to maintain consistent supply to our customers 
our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet fda  international organization for standardization  or iso  and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures 
supplier performance is maintained and managed through a supplier qualification and corrective action program intended to ensure that all product requirements are met or exceeded 
we believe these manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment  help control costs  and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products 
following the receipt of products or product components from our third party manufacturers  we conduct inspection  packaging and labeling  as needed  at either our headquarters facility or our distribution facility 
under our existing contracts  we reserve the exclusive right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications 
in the future  we may consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally  if and when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so 
we currently rely on tissue banks international  inc and allosource  inc as our only suppliers of allograft tissue implants 
allosource is also our exclusive supplier of osteocel  which is processed from allograft and was acquired from osiris therapeutics  inc like our relationships with our device manufacturing suppliers  we subject our tissue processing suppliers to the same quality criteria in terms of selection  qualification  and verification of processed tissue quality upon receipt of goods  as well as hold them accountable to compliance with fda regulation  state requirements  as well as voluntary industry standards such as the american association of tissue banks  or aatb 
we acquired neodisc  an investigational cervical disc replacement device  from pearsalls limited 
neodisc is currently the subject of a clinical trial  and our supply of the product comes solely from pearsalls limited 
we acquired rights to formagraft  a ceramic collagen bone graft matrix used to promote spinal fusion  from radius medical  llc 
our supply of the product comes solely from maxigen biotech 
we acquired pcm  a motion preserving total disc replacement device  through our acquisition of cervitech  inc our supply of the product comes solely from waldemar link gmbh co

we are in the process of establishing alternate suppliers 
we  and our third party manufacturers  are subject to the fda s quality system regulations  state regulations  such as the regulations promulgated by the california department of health services  and regulations promulgated by the european union 
for tissue products  we are fda registered and licensed in the states of california  new york  florida  maryland and oregon 
for our device implants and instruments  we are fda registered  california licensed  ce marked and iso certified 
ce is an abbreviation for european compliance 
our facility and the facilities of our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities  and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the fda and corresponding state agencies 
the fda may impose enforcement  inspections or audits at any time 

table of contents loaned instrument sets we seek to deliver surgical instrument sets  including our neurovision systems  just in time to fulfill our customer obligations to meet surgery schedules 
we do not receive separate economic value specific to the loaned instrument sets from the surgeons or hospitals that utilize them 
in most cases  once the surgery is finished  the instrument sets are returned to us and we prepare them for shipment to meet future surgeries 
this strategy minimizes backlogs  while increasing asset turns and maximizing cash flow 
our pool of surgical equipment that we loan to or place with hospitals continues to increase as we expand our distribution channels and increase market penetration of our products 
these loaned instrument sets are important to the growth of our business and we anticipate additional investments in our loaner assets 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that in order to have a competitive advantage  we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we require our shareowners  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationships with us

competition we are aware of a number of major medical device companies that have developed or plan to develop products for use in surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption in each of our current and future product categories 
our currently marketed products are  and any future products we commercialize will be  subject to intense competition 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater operating history and reputations than we do in their respective fields 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner  receive adequate reimbursement and are safer  less invasive and less expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose 
because of the size of the potential market  we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products 
below are our primary competitors grouped by our product categories 
our neurovision system competes with the conventional nerve monitoring systems offered by medtronic sofamor danek medtronic  cadwell  and nicolet biomedical 
we believe our system competes favorably with these systems on ease of use for the spine surgeon  with the added advantage that our neurovision system was designed to support surgeon directed applications with automated  real time information 
medtronic s nim eclipse neuromonitoring system  acquired from axon  while surgeon directed  requires manual interpretation for neuromonitoring 
several companies offer products that compete with our maxcess system  spherx pedicle screw system and implants  including competitive offerings by depuy spine  inc depuy  a johnson johnson company  medtronic and stryker spine 
competition is intense in the fusion product market 
we believe that our most significant competitors are medtronic  depuy  stryker spine and synthes  inc  each of which has substantially greater sales and financial resources than we do 
medtronic  in particular  has a broad classic fusion product line 
we believe our differentiation in the market is an innovative portfolio of products elegantly delivered through our maxcess system  as well as through our xlif approach  complemented by additional innovative and pull though products along the entirety of the spine 
however  with the introduction of competing lateral techniques  such as medtronic s dlif  we face more competition in the market 

table of contents competition in the motion preservation segment is increasing  with medtronic  depuy  stryker spine and synthes  inc all investing in this rapidly growing market 
in the cervical total disc replacement tdr segment  our pcm and neodisc  currently in clinical trials  if approved  will face competition from several products that received fda approval in including medtronic s prestige and bryan tdrs as well as synthes  inc s prodisc tdr 
while our acquisition of osteocel and our investment in progentix orthobiology  bv provide us with additional products to compete in the biologics market  competition is increasing 
in addition to our larger competitors  which are investing in their biologics platforms  we face competition from smaller orthobiologics companies such as orthovita and osteotech 
we also face competition from a significant number of smaller companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors 
these companies  who represent intense competition in specified markets  include globus medical  inc  zimmer spine  orthofix international nv blackstone medical  inc  biomet ebi spine  alphatec spine  inc  and others 
government regulation our products are medical devices and tissues subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
fda regulations govern  among other things  the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform product design and development  product testing  product manufacturing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior k clearance or prior premarket approval from the fda 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes 
devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class i or ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit to the fda a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution 
this process is known as k clearance 
some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement 
devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device are placed in class iii  requiring premarket approval 
k clearance pathway to obtain k clearance  a premarket notification must be submitted demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may  for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications 
the fda s k clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed  but it can take significantly longer 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new k clearance or could require premarket approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees 
table of contents with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or premarket approval is obtained 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements that we believe do not require new k clearances 
premarket approval pathway a premarket approval pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the k process 
a premarket approval application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical information  preclinical data  clinical trial data  manufacturing data and labeling to demonstrate  to the fda s satisfaction  the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use 
once a complete pma application is submitted  the fda begins an in depth review which generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
also  during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations 
new pmas or pma supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling or design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
a pma supplement often require submission of the same type of information as an original pma application  except that a supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products our allograft implant products and our osteocel products are regulated by fda as human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products 
fda regulations do not currently require products regulated as minimally manipulated human tissue based products to be k cleared or pma approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register our establishment  list these products with the fda and comply with current good tissue practices for human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based product establishments 
the fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
violations of applicable regulations noted by the fda during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products 
we believe we comply with all aspects of the current good tissue practices  although there can be no assurance that we will comply  or will comply on a timely basis  in the future 
entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery  donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the current good tissue practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities 
the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to us federal law pursuant to the national organ transplant act  or nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
with the exception of removal and implantation  we provide services in all of these areas 
we make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors 
failure to comply with the requirements of nota could result in enforcement action against us 
the procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to nota 
in addition  some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state 
failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us 

table of contents clinical trials a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a k premarket notification 
these trials generally require approval of a submitted application for an ide to the fda 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results  showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound 
the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of subjects  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated ide requirements 
clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by the fda and the responsible institutional review boards 
future clinical trials of our motion preservation designs will likely require that we obtain ides from the fda prior to commencing clinical trials 
we have gained ide approval from the fda to begin a clinical trial relating to neodisc  our embroidery cervical disc replacement device  and have completed patient enrollment for this trial 
we filed with the fda for ides on the mechanical lateral tdr xl tdr  and were granted an ide in currently  the pcm investigational device is in an fda approved clinical trial in the united states with two year follow up completed in the fourth quarter of we anticipate submitting for fda approval in the first quarter of our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations and other federal regulations concerning human subject protection and privacy and must be publicly registered 
the results of our clinical trials may not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product 
there are numerous risks associated with conducting such a clinical trial  including the high costs and uncertain outcomes 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include  but are not limited to quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  process control  and other quality assurance procedures  labeling regulations  which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling  and medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to unannounced device inspections by the fda and the california food and drug branch  as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations 
these inspections may include our subcontractors facilities 

table of contents sales and marketing commercial compliance federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration by an individual or entity in return for  or to induce the referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored healthcare program 
possible sanctions for violation of these anti kickback laws include monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions 
in addition to the anti kickback law  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
off label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 
additionally  the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti kickback  false claims  anti fee splitting and self referral laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
to enforce compliance with the federal laws  the us department of justice doj has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations  prosecutions  convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry 
dealing with investigations can be time and resource consuming 
additionally  if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the doj or other law enforcement agencies  the company may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement 
additionally  the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states  including california  massachusetts and vermont  mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs  along with the tracking and reporting of gifts  compensation  and other remuneration to physicians 
federal legislation  pursuant to the physician payments sunshine act of sunshine act  has been proposed and is moving forward in congress under the healthcare reform act of the sunshine act would require public disclosure to the federal government of payments to physicians  including in kind transfers of value such as free gifts or meals 
these requirements all provide for penalties for non compliance 
the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 
international international sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations  which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
the european union  which consists of countries in europe  has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design  manufacture  clinical trials  labeling  and adverse event reporting for medical devices 
other countries  such as switzerland  have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the european union with respect to medical devices 
devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear ce conformity marking and  accordingly  can be commercially distributed throughout europe 
the method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product  but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body 
this third party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer s product 
we have now successfully passed several notified body audits since our original certification in  
table of contents granting us iso registration and allowing the ce conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices under the european union medical device directive 
we have expanded our certification scope and are now working with two different notified bodies overseeing our currently released  as well as forthcoming  product development projects 
the japanese government in recent years made revisions to the pharmaceutical affairs law pal that made significant changes to the preapproval regulatory systems 
these changes have in part  stipulated that in addition to obtaining a manufacturing or import approval from the ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw certain low risk medical devices can now be evaluated by third party organizations 
based on the risk based classification  manufacturers are provided three procedures for satisfying the pal requirements prior to placing products on the market  pre market submission todokede  pre market certification ninsho and pre market approval shonin 
nuvasive intends to market devices in japan that will be assessed by both government entities and third party organizations using all three procedures in place for manufacturers 
the level of review and time line for medical device approval will depend on the risk based classification and subsequent regulatory procedure that the medical device is aligned based on assessment against the pharmaceutical affairs law 
manufacturers must also obtain a manufacturing or import license from the prefectural government prior to importing medical devices 
we will also be pursuing authorizations required by the prefectural government 
third party reimbursement we expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  such as governmental programs  for example  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure  coverage of the codes by the third party payers  and adequate payment for the resources used 
physician coding for procedures is established by the american medical association ama 
for coding related to spine surgery  the north american spine society nass is the primary liaison to ama 
in july of nass established the proper physician coding for the xlif procedure by declaring it to be encompassed in existing codes that describe an anterolateral approach to the spine 
this position was confirmed in a formal statement in january hospital coding is established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
xlif is not currently included in the nomenclature for hospital codes but has been proposed as an additional descriptor of existing codes 
cms proposal is slated for review and ratification in all physician and hospital coding is subject to change which could impact reimbursement and physician practice behavior 
independent of the coding status  third party payers may deny coverage based on their own criteria  such as if they feel that a device or procedure is not well established clinically  is not the most cost effective treatment available  or is used for an unapproved indication 
in december  a certain third party payer  cigna healthcare  established a national policy that labels xlif as experimental or investigational and states that they do not provide reimbursement for the xlif procedure 
since december  other third party payers also established similar non coverage policies  which are both national and local in scope 
such policies are not customarily intended to dictate the practice of medicine or override the judgment of the regional medical directors of a given third party payer and these policies have not materially impacted our operating results 
nuvasive will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients  physicians  hospitals  and insurers in order to ensure the best in patient care and clarity regarding xlif reimbursement and work to remove the non coverage policies 
national and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 
payment amounts are established by government and private payer programs and are subject to fluctuations which could impact physician practice behavior 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in international markets  reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines 
there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third party payers  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 

table of contents particularly in the united states  third party payers carefully review  and increasingly challenge  the prices charged for procedures and medical products as well as any technology that they  in their own judgment  consider experimental or investigational 
in addition  an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs  which monitor and often require pre approval of the services that a member will receive 
many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis  which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined payment per member per month 
the percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the united states over the next decade 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
healthcare fraud and abuse healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or most other federally funded health care programs 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs  such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
the anti kickback law is subject to evolving interpretations 
for example  the government has enforced the anti kickback law to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians 
the majority of states also have anti kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions 
if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including  for example  exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 
additionally  the civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false  fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the us government 
actions under the false claims act may be brought by the attorney general or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government 
violations of the false claims act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages 
the federal government is using the false claims act  and the accompanying threat of significant liability  in its investigations of health care providers  suppliers and manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of medicare billing practices  and has obtained multi million and multi billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions 
given the significant size of actual and potential settlements  it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating health care providers  suppliers  and manufacturers compliance with the health care billing  coverage and reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws 
shareowners our employees we refer to our employees as shareowners 
as of december   we had shareowners  of which were employed in research and development  in regulatory and quality assurance  in general and administrative and operations and in sales and marketing including international shareowners 
in addition to our shareowners  we partner with exclusive independent sales agencies and independent distributors who sell our products in the united states and internationally  respectively 
none of our shareowners are represented by a labor union and we believe our shareowner relations are good

item a 
risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
under these circumstances  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
further  additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business  operations  liquidity and stock price materially and adversely 
risks related to our business and industry certain third party payers have stated non coverage decisions concerning our xlif technology  additional third party payers may adopt similar policies and such medical reimbursement decisions may negatively impact our ability to sell our complete product portfolio and expand our operations and increase profitability 
sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payers 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
likewise  spine surgeons rely primarily on third party reimbursement for the surgical fees they earn 
spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical procedures 
certain third party payers have stated non coverage decisions concerning our xlif technology and implementation of such policies could significantly alter our ability to sell any products that the payers categorize under xlif 
additional payers may also state that our xlif technology is not covered 
the inability to successfully market xlif due to lack of reimbursement coverage may adversely impact our ability to acquire new physician clients  increase market penetration with existing clients  or retain existing clients across nuvasive product lines 
the xlif procedure is a significant feature of our maximum access surgery  or mas  product platform  which is our principal product offering 
lack of xlif reimbursement coverage may deter physician interest in xlif  and in turn mas and the entirety of our product offering 
any such decisions could adversely impact our ability to sell our products 

table of contents we also believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the united states and in international markets 
future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may adversely affect the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
to the extent we sell our products internationally  market acceptance may depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
pricing pressure from our competitors may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations and increase profitability 
the market for spine surgery products is large and growing at a significant rate 
this has attracted numerous new companies and technologies  and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pressure 
new entrants to our markets include numerous niche companies with singular product focus  as well as companies owned partially by spine surgeons  who have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products 
as a result of this increased competition  we believe there will be growing pricing pressure in the near future 
if competitive forces drive down the price we are able to charge for our products  our profit margins will shrink  which will hamper our ability to invest in and grow our business and increase profitability 
we are in a highly competitive market segment and face competition from large  well established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants 
the market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
with respect to neurovision  our nerve avoidance system  we compete with medtronic sofamor danek  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of medtronic  inc  and nicolet biomedical  a viasys healthcare company  both of which have significantly greater resources than we do  as well as numerous regional nerve monitoring companies 
with respect to maxcess  our minimally disruptive surgical system  our largest competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  inc  depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  and synthes stratec  inc 
we compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies with respect to our implant products  many of whom have a significant regional market presence 
at any time  these companies may develop alternative treatments  products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products 
many of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies  and enjoy several competitive advantages over us  including significantly greater name recognition  established relations with a greater number of spine surgeons  hospitals  other healthcare providers and third party payers  larger and more well established distribution networks with significant international presence  products supported by long term clinical data  greater experience in obtaining and maintaining us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements  more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights  and greater financial and other resources for product research and development  sales and marketing and litigation 
in addition  the spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new market entrants  including companies owned at least partially by spine surgeons 
many of these new competitors focus on a specific product or market segment  making it more difficult for us to expand our overall market position 
if these companies become 
table of contents successful  we expect that competition will become even more intense  leading to greater pricing pressure and making it more difficult for us to expand 
our future success depends on our strategy of obsoleting our own products and our ability to timely acquire  develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market 
we have the objective of staying ahead of the spine market by obsoleting our own products with new products and enhancements 
it is important to our business that we continue to build upon our product offering to surgeons and hospitals  and enhance the products we currently offer 
as such  our success will depend in part on our ability to acquire  develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with the rapidly changing spine market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire  develop  obtain regulatory approval for or market new products or that any of our future products or enhancements will be accepted by the surgeons who use our products or the payers who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products 
additionally  in our quest to obsolete our products  we must effectively manage our inventory  the demand for new and current product and the regulatory process for new products in order to avoid unintended financial and accounting consequences 
if we do not effectively manage our strategy of obsoleting our products by acquiring or developing new products or product enhancements that we can introduce in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements  our results of operations may suffer 
if clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the united states  we will be unable to commercialize these products 
several investigational devices in our development pipeline  including our neodisc cervical disc replacement device  pcm  and  and lateral tdr xl tdr  will require premarket approval  or pma  from the fda 
a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the less rigorous k process 
a pma application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 
as a result  to receive regulatory approval for neodisc  pcm  xltdr or other devices requiring pma approval  we must conduct  at our own expense  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans 
clinical testing is expensive  takes many years and has an uncertain outcome 
clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing 
our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results  and we may decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional clinical and or non clinical testing 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory approval and  ultimately  the commercialization of that device 
our neodisc  pcm  and xltdr devices are currently the subject of an investigational device exemption clinical study 
there is no assurance that these devices will be approved for sale in the united states by the fda 
the clinical study may prove that the device does not provide the intended benefit or that there are unintended negative side effects of the device that make it unsafe or not effective 
in addition  the neodisc device includes embroidery technology  which has not been thoroughly studied for use as permanent implants in the spine 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for these devices will hamper our ability to commercialize the device in the united states 
if our acquisitions are unsuccessful  our business may be harmed 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired companies  technologies and product lines to maintain our objectives of developing or acquiring innovative technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following the possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition  which could result in future non cash impairment charges  
table of contents difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  which may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business  the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies  and difficulties in retaining key relationships with shareowners employees  customers  partners and suppliers of the acquired company 
any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or financing position 
specifically  our osteocel acquisition is the largest acquisition we have ever completed  with a total acquisition price of million 
if we failed to properly value that business  or fail to generate expected revenues or profits from operation of that business  our results of operations will suffer 
additionally  our investment in progentix orthobiology bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic biologic  includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
if the progentix products are not commercially successful or unable to meet expected commercial success  but certain development milestones are achieved  we may be obligated to purchase progentix orthobiology bv at a price greater than the value of the company 
further  past and potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business  especially where we have little experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology as is the case with the osteocel biologic product 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
acquisitions may also further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
our reliance on single source suppliers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers to supply and manufacture our products 
to be successful  our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  in accordance with agreed upon specifications  at acceptable cost and on a timely basis 
our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products  materials and components 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet customer demand on a timely basis  we could lose customers  our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer 
we currently use one or two manufacturers for each of our devices or components 
our dependence on one or two manufacturers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality and delivery schedules 
if any one or more of our manufacturers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality  we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing 
we could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage alternative suppliers on favorable terms 
any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
invibio  inc is our exclusive supplier of polyetheretherketone  which comprises our peek partial vertebral body product called coroent 
we have a supply agreement with invibio  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of polyetheretherketone for our current product lines from invibio 
we also have an exclusive supply arrangement with delphi corporation delphi pursuant to which delphi is our exclusive supplier of neurovision systems 
in the event we experience delays  shortages  or stoppages of supply with either supplier  we would be forced to locate a suitable alternative supplier which could take significant time and result in significant expense 
any inability to meet our customers demands for these products could lead to decreased sales and harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers to our competitors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents maxigen biotech  inc  or mbi  is our exclusive supplier of our formagraft product 
we are party to a supply agreement with mbi  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of formagraft from mbi 
we may require that mbi significantly expand its manufacturing capacity to meet our potential forecasted needs  and no assurance can be given that mbi will be able to meet our requirements 
if we experience difficulties in dealing with mbi we may not be able to secure an adequate source of supply of formagraft  which could adversely affect our operational results 
we acquired pcm  a motion preserving total disc replacement device  through our acquisition of cervitech  inc our supply of the product comes solely from waldemar link gmbh co 
kg  a company that was affiliated with cervitech prior to the acquisition 
we are in the process of determining whether to establish alternate suppliers and there is no assurance that we will be able to establish a new supplier which could adversely affect our operational results 
further  tissue banks international  inc and allosource  inc 
collectively supply us with all of our allograft implants  and will continue to be our only sources for the foreseeable future 
the processing of human tissue into allograft implants is very labor intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream 
allosource is also our exclusive supplier of osteocel  which is processed from allograft and was acquired from osiris therapeutics  inc allograft  which is donated human tissue  is a supply constrained material and there is ongoing risk that there will be insufficient supply to produce the necessary quantity of osteocel and our other allograft products 
in addition  due to seasonal changes in mortality rates  some scarce tissues used for our allograft products are at times in particularly short supply 
allograft also carries with it the possibility of disease transmission  which could result in negative patient outcomes and negative publicity for us 
we cannot be certain that our supply of allograft from tissue banks international and allosource  inc will be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs 
if we are no longer able to obtain allograft from these sources in amounts sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate and engage replacement sources of allograft on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any interruption of our business caused by the need to locate additional sources of allograft could reduce our revenues 
we are dependent on the services of alexis v 
lukianov and keith valentine  and the loss of either of them could harm our business 
our continued success depends in part upon the continued service of alexis v 
lukianov  our chairman and chief executive officer  and keith valentine  our president and chief operating officer  who are critical to the overall management of nuvasive as well as to the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
lukianov and valentine  but neither of these agreements guarantees the service of the individual for a specified period of time 
the loss of either messr 
lukianov or valentine could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not obtained and do not expect to obtain any key person life insurance policies 
if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth  our business could suffer 
the rapid growth of our business has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated growth successfully  we must generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control  attract and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel  assimilate new staff members and manage the complexities associated with a larger  faster growing and more geographically diverse organization  expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global  larger and more complex clinical trials  
table of contents expand our sales and marketing resources for international expansion and to launch an increasing number of new products from our product pipeline  accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply while maintaining quality standards  and upgrade our internal business processes and capabilities eg  information technology platform and systems  product distribution and tracking to create the scalability that a growing business demands 
further  our anticipated growth  both internationally and domestically  will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers  resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
if we fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements  our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer 
our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
in particular  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application  or pma 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
the pma process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k clearance process 
additionally  any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary 
our failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  termination of distribution  or product seizures 
in the most egregious cases  criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities 
additionally  surgeons use several of our products for unapproved uses 
while surgeons are permitted by the fda to use our products for unapproved uses  there is a heightened risk of an enforcement action by a governmental enforcement authority when surgeons engage in that practice 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we market and sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
in such circumstances  we would rely significantly on our foreign independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations  and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries 
the safety of our products is not yet supported by long term clinical data and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought 
we obtained clearance to offer almost all of our products that require fda clearance or approval through the fda s k clearance process 
the fda s k clearance process is less rigorous than the pma process and requires less supporting clinical data 
as a result  we currently lack the breadth of published long term clinical data 
table of contents supporting the safety of our products and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with the pma process 
for these reasons  spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products  we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks 
further  future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes 
such results would reduce demand for our products  affect our ability to have sustainable reimbursement for our products from third party payers  significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability 
moreover  if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation 
the spine medical device market has been particularly prone to costly product liability litigation 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  the manufacture of our products could be delayed and we may be subject to an enforcement action by the fda 
we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through inspections 
if we or one of our suppliers fail a quality system regulations inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient  the manufacture of our products could be delayed 
we underwent an fda inspection in april regarding our allograft implant business and another fda inspection in june regarding our medical device activities 
in connection with these inspections as well as prior inspections  the fda requested minor corrective actions  which we have taken to satisfy the corrective actions 
there can be no assurance the fda will not subject us to further enforcement action and the fda may impose additional inspections at any time 
additionally  we are the legal manufacturer of record for the products that are distributed and labeled by nuvasive  regardless of whether the products are manufactured by us or our suppliers 
thus  a failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
risks related to our financial results and need for financing we may be unable to grow our revenue or earnings as anticipated  which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we have experienced rapid growth since our inception  and have increased our revenues from million in  the year of our initial public offering  to million in we anticipate continued growth and have provided guidance related to such growth for our ability to achieve the anticipated growth will depend upon  among other things  the success of our growth strategies  which we cannot assure you will be successful 
in addition  we may have more difficulty maintaining our prior rate of growth of revenues or recent earnings 
our future success will depend upon various factors  including the strength of our brand image  the market success of our current and future products  competitive conditions and our ability to manage increased revenues  if any  or implement our growth strategy 
in addition  we anticipate significantly expanding our infrastructure and adding personnel in connection with our anticipated growth  which we expect will cause our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and which may cause our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
because these expenses are generally fixed  particularly in the short term  operating results may be adversely impacted if we do not achieve our anticipated growth 

table of contents the financial crisis and general slowdown of the economy may adversely affect our liquidity and the liquidity of our customers 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments in marketable securities 
we have historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies  corporate debt  money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria 
certain of these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity and other market risks 
the general condition of the financial markets and the economy has exacerbated those risks and may affect the value of our current investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets 
the liquidity of our customers and suppliers may also be affected by the current financial crisis 
if our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected 
if our customers liquidity and creditworthiness is negatively impacted by the current financial crisis and the condition of the economy  our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and our collection cycles may be adversely affected 
our quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate significantly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  particularly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
these fluctuations may also affect our annual operating results and may cause those results to fluctuate unexpectedly from year to year 
the level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors our ability to increase sales of our products to hospitals and surgeons  the efficiency of our distribution network to maximize our inventory of products and instruments in order to meet the demands of our customers  our ability to expand and maintain an effective and dedicated sales force  pricing pressure applicable to our products  including adverse third party reimbursement outcomes  results of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development and our ability to obtain fda approval or clearance  the mix of our products sold and the geographic markets in which our products are sold ie  profit margins differ between our products and between different geographic markets  both domestically and internationally  timing of new product launches  acquisitions  licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors  the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of materials and components and meet our quality requirements  the evolving product offerings of our competitors and the potential introduction of new and competing technologies  and regulatory approvals and legislative and reimbursement policy changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors 
many of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require fda approval or clearance  without which we cannot begin to commercialize them in the united states  and commercialization of them outside of the united states would likely require other regulatory approvals and import licenses 
as a result  it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty 
in addition  we will be increasing our operating expenses as we build our commercial capabilities 
accordingly  we may experience significant  unanticipated quarterly losses 
because of these factors  our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 

table of contents upon the achievement of certain milestones related to our acquisitions  we may be required to make payments which may affect our liquidity and our financial results 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  we may be obligated to make payments in the future upon the achievement of certain milestones 
we currently have million in outstanding potential milestone obligations under our agreement with the shareholders of cervitech and may be required to make milestone payments upon the completion of certain milestones and purchase the remaining sixty percent of progentix orthobiology bv for an aggregate amount up to million 
the likelihood of those milestones being achieved and the timing of such payments are uncertain and are subject to change over time 
if we are required to make those payments  particularly at a time when we are experiencing financial difficulty  our liquidity  financial results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as we attempt to expand into international markets  which could disrupt our us business operations  present risks not originally contemplated and harm our operating results 
we have invested  and expect to increase our investment for the foreseeable future  in our expansion into international markets 
we currently expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expand into international markets 
we have only limited experience in expanding into international markets as well as marketing and operating our products and services in such markets 
certain international markets take a lot of time and resources to receive product approvals and clearances to sell and promote products 
after we receive the appropriate approvals and clearances  international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our products and are expected to yield lower profit margins when compared to our domestic operations 
additionally  our international endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management from current operations  insufficient revenue to offset expenses associated with our international strategy  and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 
because expansion into international markets is inherently risky  no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
even if our international expansion is successful  our expenses may increase at a greater pace than our revenues and our operating results could be harmed 
risks related to our intellectual property and potential litigation we are currently involved in a patent litigation action involving medtronic and  if we do not prevail in this action  we could be liable for past damages and might be prevented from making  using  selling  offering to sell  importing or exporting certain of our products 
on august   medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic filed suit against nuvasive in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of our products infringe  or contribute to the infringement of  us patents owned by medtronic 
medtronic is a large  publicly traded corporation with significantly greater financial resources than us 
intellectual property litigation is expensive  complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict 
we may also be subject to negative publicity due to the litigation 
pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property  and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged  and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all  and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if any strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
furthermore  if we are found to infringe patent claims of a third party  we may  among other 
table of contents things  be required to pay damages  including up to treble damages and attorney s fees and costs  which may be substantial 
an unfavorable outcome for us in this patent litigation could significantly harm our business if such outcome makes us unable to commercialize some of our current or potential products or cease some of our business operations 
in addition  costs of defense and any damages resulting from the litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
the litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity  each of which could harm our business and financial results 
our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our pending us and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable to ours 
moreover  competitors may challenge our issued patents through the reexamination process in the us and or opposition proceedings outside the us  such as was done by medtronic on two of our us patents related to aspects of our xlif surgical technique 
we asserted these patents against medtronic as part of our ongoing patent litigation 
patent reexamination was granted by the us patent office in each case 
if the us patent office cancels or narrows the claims in these patents  it could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce them against competitors 
although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers  shareowners  consultants and advisors  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  there are numerous proposed changes to the patent laws and rules of the us patent and trademark office which  if enacted  may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights 
moreover  congress is considering several significant changes to the us patent laws  including among other things changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system  limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have issued 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be costly  difficult and time consuming 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  certain product categories  including pedicle screws  have been the subject of significant patent litigation in recent years 
since we sell pedicle screws and recently introduced our spherx and armada pedicle screw systems  any related litigation could harm our business 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
it is not unusual for parties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages  including treble damages in some cases 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our 
table of contents management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if our products are found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 
a patent infringement suit brought against us or any of our strategic partners or licensees may force us or such strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or our strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if our strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications  including bleeding  nerve injury  paralysis and even death 
in addition  we sell allograft products  derived from cadaver bones  which pose the potential risk of biological contamination 
if any such contamination is found to exist  sales of allograft products could decline and our reputation would be harmed 
currently  we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award  we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves which may harm our financial condition 
if longer term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component cause tissue damage  motor impairment or other adverse effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry  lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our business 
any claims relating to us making improper payments to physicians for consulting services  or other potential violations of laws or regulations governing interactions between us and healthcare providers  could be time consuming and costly 
our relationship with surgeons  hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal anti kickback  self referral  false claims and similar laws  often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex  and even minor  inadvertent violations can potentially give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated 
any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with surgeons  hospitals and marketers of our products 

table of contents federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration by an individual or entity in return for  or to induce the referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored healthcare program 
possible sanctions for violation of these anti kickback laws include monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions 
from through  numerous medical device manufacturers have entered into deferred prosecution agreements and corporate integrity agreements with the federal government and paid hundreds of millions of dollars  in aggregate  to the government over allegations that the companies had paid kickbacks to surgeons to reward and incentivize use of their surgical implant products 
in addition  the government has indicted and prosecuted employees of companies for their alleged involvement in kickback arrangements 
furthermore  the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti kickback laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
to enforce compliance with federal laws  the us department of justice  or doj  has increased its scrutiny of the interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers  which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations and settlements in the healthcare industry 
dealing with doj investigations can be time and resource consuming 
additionally  if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the doj  or other law enforcement agencies  it may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement 
further  the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry with certain states mandating implementation of commercial compliance programs and disclosure requirements while similar legislation has been proposed and is proceeding on the federal level in the form of the physician payment sunshine act 
in addition to the anti kickback law  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
examples of enforcement under this law include the prosecution of several pharmaceutical and device companies for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company s marketing of the product for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 
we market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to surgeons regarding the use of our products 
although we believe our marketing  promotional materials and training programs for surgeons do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products  if it is determined that our marketing  promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses  we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure and criminal penalty 
we must comply with a variety of other laws  such as the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act of  which protects the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information  and the federal trade commission act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections 
the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change  especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations 
there can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory authorities will not challenge or investigate our current or future activities under these laws 
any such challenge or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any state or federal regulatory review of us  regardless of the outcome  would be costly and time consuming 
additionally  we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws  whether or not retroactive 

table of contents we or our suppliers may be the subject of claims for non compliance with fda regulations in connection with the processing or distribution of allograft products 
it is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks  including those with which we have a contractual relationship  claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft products does not comply with applicable fda regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations 
allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us  or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry generally 
these actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the attention of our management from our business  harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially  potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially 
for example  the closing price for our stock on the last day of the past four quarters was on march   on june   on september   and on december  fluctuation in the stock price may occur due to many factors  including general market conditions and other factors such as the effect the financial crisis is having on stock markets as a whole  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors  volume and timing of orders for our products  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance or approval for  and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  quarterly variations in our or our competitor s results of operations  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers and directors  announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  clearances or applications  the acquisition or divestiture of businesses  products  assets or technology  litigation  including intellectual property litigation  announcements of actions by the fda or other regulatory agencies  and changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts 
market price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  prohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with stockholder approval  and require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then current board of directors  including delay or impede a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be our stockholders source of potential gain for the foreseeable future

item legal proceedings 
we have been involved in a series of related lawsuits involving families of decedents who donated their bodies through ucla s willed body program 
the complaint alleges that the head of ucla s willed body program  henry g 
reid  and a third party  ernest v 
nelson  improperly sold some of the donated cadavers to the defendants including nuvasive 
plaintiffs allege the following causes of action i breach of fiduciary duty  ii negligence  
table of contents iii fraud  iv negligent misrepresentation  v negligent infliction of emotional distress  vi intentional infliction of emotional distress  vii intentional interference with human remains  viii negligent interference with human remains  ix violation of california business and professions code section  and x injunctive and declaratory relief 
we had been dismissed from these lawsuits by the trial court but the decision was appealed and in july  the appellate court reversed the trial court s decision to dismiss us from these lawsuits 
we have appealed this decision  the appellate court has heard our appeal and we are currently awaiting the decision of the court 
although the outcome of this lawsuit cannot be determined with certainty  we believe that we acted within the relevant law in procuring the cadavers for our clinical research and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the claims contained in the complaint 
as reported by us previously  medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic  on august   filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nuvasive in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of nuvasive s products or methods  including the xlif procedure  infringe  or contribute to the infringement of  twelve us patents nos 
   assigned or licensed to medtronic medtronic patents 
medtronic is seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court injunction against future infringement by nuvasive

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements may prove inaccurate you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this report 
this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under heading risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  a market estimated to exceed billion in the united states in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as a growing offering of biologics  cervical and motion preservation products 
in the spine surgery market  our currently marketed products are primarily used to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures and develop motion preserving products such as our total disc replacement products 
we dedicate significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts  including training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
currently  we are training approximately to surgeons annually  which includes surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
our mas platform combines four categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  biologics includes our formagraft and osteocel line of products  and specialized implants includes our spherx and armada tm pedicle screw systems  coroent suite of implants  and several fixation systems 
our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by neurovision  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and our neurovision system allows surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
certain insurance providers have stated a policy of not providing reimbursement for the xlif procedure 
nuvasive cannot offer definitive time frames nor final outcomes regarding reversal of the non coverage policies  as the process is dictated by third party insurance providers 
to date  these policies have not materially impacted our operating results 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as in the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
in  we acquired cervitech inc cervitech  a company focused on clinical approval of the pcm cervical disc system  a motion preserving total disc replacement device 
this strategic acquisition allows us the potential to accelerate our entry into the growing mechanical cervical disc replacement market 
currently  the pcm investigational device has reached the two year follow up end point in its fda approved clinical trial in the united states 
approval  if obtained  will further strengthen our cervical product offering and will enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 
our biologic offering includes formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process  and osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 

table of contents in we purchased forty percent of the capital stock of progentix orthobiology  bv progentix  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands  from existing shareholders for million in cash the initial investment 
progentix has as its objective the development and exploitation of knowledge and products in the field of bone defects and the recovery of bone tissue in general 
progentix wishes to further extend the existing knowledge and patent position in the field of osteoinductive bone graft material technology 
we have an active product development pipeline focused on expanding our current fusion product platform as well as products designed to preserve spinal motion 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenues 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of disposables and implants and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
we loan our neurovision systems and surgical instrument sets at no cost to surgeons and hospitals that purchase disposables and implants for use in individual procedures  there are no minimum purchase requirements of disposables and implants related to these loaned surgical instruments 
in addition  we place neurovision  maxcess and other mas or cervical surgical instrument sets with hospitals for an extended period at no up front cost to them provided they commit to minimum monthly purchases of disposables and implants 
our implants and disposables are currently sold and shipped from our primary distribution and warehousing operations facility located in memphis  tennessee 
we recognize revenue for disposables or implants used upon receiving acknowledgement of a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation 
in addition  we sell an immaterial number of mas instrument sets  maxcess devices  and neurovision systems 
to date  we have derived less than of our total revenues from these sales 
sales and marketing 
through  substantially all of our operations are located in the united states and substantially all of our sales to date have been generated in the united states 
we sell our products in the united states through a sales force comprised of exclusive independent sales agents and our own directly employed sales professionals  both selling only nuvasive spine surgery products 
our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and is compensated based on sales and product placements in their territories 
sales force commissions are reflected in our statement of operations in the sales  marketing and administrative expense line 
we expect to continue to expand our distribution channel 
beginning late in and continuing today  we are continuing our expansion of international sales efforts with the focus on both european and asian markets 
our international sales force is made up of a combination of independent distributors and direct sales personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  inventories  valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  income taxes  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
specifically  revenue from the sale of implants and disposables is recognized upon acknowledgement of a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation or upon shipment to third 
table of contents party customers who immediately accept title 
revenue from the sale of our instrument sets is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and the subsequent shipment to customers who immediately accept title 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on the aging of account balances  collection history and known trends with current customers and in the economy in general 
as a result of this review  the allowance is adjusted on a specific identification basis 
an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding charge to sales  marketing and administrative expense 
we maintain a relatively large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with any one particular customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  or if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not accurately reflect our customer s future failure to pay outstanding receivables  significant additional allowances could be required 
in addition  we establish a reserve for estimated sales returns that is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
this reserve is maintained to account for future return of products sold in the current period 
this reserve is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience related to product returns 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence and excess inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our allograft products have shelf lives ranging from two to four years and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of disposables and specialized implants  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold 
a stated goal of our business is to focus on continual product innovation and to obsolete our own products 
while we believe this provides a competitive edge  it also results in the risk that our products and related capital instruments will become obsolete prior to sale or to the end of their anticipated useful lives 
if we introduce new products or next generation products  we may be required to dispose of existing inventory prior to the end of their estimated useful life and or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the capital instruments 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include projections of pre tax book income for the foreseeable future  determination of cumulative pre tax book income after permanent differences  history of earnings  and reliability of forecasting 
at december   we have maintained a valuation allowance equal to substantially all of the us deferred tax assets as we concluded we are not able to meet the more likely than not future realization threshold required 
at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state loss carryforwards begin to expire in and in the year prescribed by state statute  respectively  unless previously utilized 
at december   we have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credits begin to expire in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
valuation of stock based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based awards exchanged for shareowner employee and non employee director services are expensed over the requisite service period 
option 
table of contents awards issued to non employees excluding non employee directors are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance  and are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan using a black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the stock options 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  specifically with respect to anticipated forfeitures  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs for future grants 
these changes  if any  may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology  in process research and development  manufacturing know how  licensed technology  supply agreements and trade names and trademarks 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions 
the determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and ipr d are not amortized 
the value and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization 
authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review 
for purposes of assessing the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company estimates the value of the reporting unit using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives through december  we evaluate our intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  trademarks and trade names  customer relationships and agreements  manufacturing know how and other intangibles and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to years 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets through december  
table of contents property and equipment 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
we depreciate the instrument sets that we loan to or place with hospitals over an estimated useful life of three years 
if we introduce new products or next generation products  we may be required to dispose of loaned instrument sets prior to the end of their estimated useful life and or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the these assets 
maintenance and repairs on all property and equipment are expensed as incurred 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies

results of operations revenue year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands revenue revenues have increased over time due primarily to continued market acceptance of our products within our mas platform  including neurovision and maxcess disposables  and our specialized implants such as our xlp tm lateral plate  spherx pedicle screw systems  and coroent suite of products 
the continued adoption of minimally invasive procedures for spine has led to the continued expansion of our innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
the execution of our strategy of expanding our product offering for the lumbar region and addressing broader indications further up the spine in the thoracic and cervical regions has contributed to revenue growth in each year 
we expect revenue to continue to increase  which can be attributed to the continued adoption of our xlif procedure and deeper penetration into existing accounts as our sales force executes on the strategy of selling the full mix of our products 
in addition  the expansion of our biologics offering  including osteocel  acquired in july  other strategic business and asset acquisitions and new product introductions are expected to lead to continued revenue growth 
cost of goods sold  excludes amortization of purchased technology year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands cost of goods sold of total revenue cost of goods sold consists of costs of purchased goods and royalty expense 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in over  primarily driven by the mix shift in total revenues represented by our biologic product line that have a lower margin relative to other product lines 
the increase in cost of goods sold in total dollars in compared to and in compared to resulted primarily from increased material costs of million and million  respectively  associated with higher revenues in each year 
we expect cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenue  to remain relatively consistent for the foreseeable future 
consistent with our philosophy of continual product innovation and obsoleting our own products  we have launched several new products and enhancements over the last few years 
in connection with the product launches  certain implants were rendered obsolete 
as a result  we incurred additional expenses of   and  in  and  respectively  related to inventory rendered obsolete 
this expense is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the respective years 

table of contents operating expenses sales  marketing and administrative year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands sales  marketing and administrative of total revenue sales  marketing and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  commission and training costs for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer support functions  distributor commissions  depreciation expense for loaned instrument sets used in surgeries  shipping costs  surgeon training costs  shareowner employee related expenses for our administrative functions  and third party professional service fees 
the increases in sales  marketing and administrative expenses principally result from growth in our revenue and the overall growth of the company  including expenses that fluctuate with sales and expenses associated with investments in our infrastructure and headcount growth 
increases in costs based on revenue  such as sales force compensation and other direct costs related to the sales force  and shipping costs were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
the increases are consistent with our increased revenue growth of approximately in as compared to and percent in as compared to  and an overall increase in sales force headcount of approximately in compared to and in as compared to total costs related to our sales force  as a percent of revenue  were   and in   and  respectively 
we also experienced increased costs as a result of overall company growth and headcount additions in our marketing and administrative support functions 
our marketing and administrative headcount increased over during marketing and administrative compensation and personnel costs increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
depreciation expense related to our loaned instrument sets increased million and million in and  respectively  as compared to previous years  due to higher capital levels of instrument sets used in surgeries 
equipment and computer expenses increased by million and million in and  respectively  compared to the same periods in prior years  primarily as a result of headcount growth and increased costs to support the increasing number of shareowners employees 
stock based compensation increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
the increase in as compared to and as compared to is primarily related to an increase in the number of option grants due to increased headcount year over year for all years presented and valuation related changes for all options granted  most significantly  the market value of our common stock 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standard board s fasb revised authoritative guidance for business combinations  which requires that acquisition related costs be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
this differs from previous accounting treatment in that the acquisition related expenses were included as part of the purchase price of the acquired company 
we incurred approximately million in acquisition related costs in connection with our investment in progentix and acquisition of cervitech in with no comparable expense during the same periods in or as previously disclosed  in  medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic filed an intellectual property suit against us 
as a result of the litigation  our sales  marketing and administrative expenses increased million and million during and  respectively 
the increases in costs discussed above were offset by decreases in costs for compared to the same period in  related to charges totaling million for vacating the company s previous corporate headquarters and incremental transition costs related to our erp system which were recorded in in august  we relocated our corporate headquarters to a two building campus style complex in san diego 
in connection with vacating our former corporate headquarters  we recorded a charge of approximately million to sales  marketing  and 
table of contents administrative expenses for lease termination costs and other related items 
in addition  during  we incurred non capitalizable expenses totaling million related to the implementation of our new erp system which was completed in the third quarter of during the third quarter of  due to continued growth  we decided to reoccupy the former corporate headquarters facility 
accordingly  in  the remaining liability related to lease termination costs of million was reversed and is recorded as a reduction of sales  marketing  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  on a long term basis  as a percentage of revenue  we expect total sales  marketing and administrative costs to continue to decrease over time 
research and development year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands research and development of total revenue research and development expense consists primarily of product research and development  clinical trial and study costs  regulatory and clinical functions  and shareowner employee related expenses 
in the last several years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products  and marked our entrance into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications  which are currently in different phases of clinical trials and related studies 
we anticipate continuing to incur costs related to such clinical trials and studies through at least the increases in research and development costs in compared to and in compared to are primarily due to increases in compensation and other shareowner related expenses of million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to increased headcount to support our product development and enhancement efforts  including an increase in stock based compensation of million in as compared to  and increased expenses related to ongoing clinical trial and other research activities of million in as compared to  including million in research expenses related to our investment in progentix orthobiology 
these increases are offset by decreased clinical trial and related study costs of million in compared to due in part to the neodisc trial becoming fully enrolled during august  with no comparable costs for neodisc in we expect research and development costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future in support of our ongoing development activities and planned clinical trial activities 
amortization of intangible assets year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands amortization of intangible assets of total revenue amortization of intangible assets relates to amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired 
the increase in amortization expense in compared to and in compared to is due to the increased acquisition activity undertaken in and we expect expenses recorded in connection with the amortization of intangible assets to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as amortization of acquired in process research and development commences upon it reaching technological feasibility 

table of contents in process research and development during  we recorded in process research and development ipr d charges of million related to the acquisitions of pedicle screw technology and osteocel 
as of the date of the acquisitions  the projects associated with the ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the amounts were charged to expense on the acquisition dates in accordance with the authoritative guidance in effect on the dates of acquisition 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the fasb s revised authoritative guidance for business combinations  which is applied prospectively for all new business acquisitions entered into after january  and provides that ipr d acquired is no longer charged to expense on the acquisition date  but rather recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
amounts recorded as ipr d beginning after january   will begin being amortized upon first sales of the product over the estimated useful life of the technology 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million on our balance sheet related to ipr d in conjunction with our investment in progentix and acquisition of cervitech as further development is required and regulatory approval has not been obtained 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  as the technology has not yet been proven  the amortization of the acquired ipr d has not begun 
currently  the pcm investigational device acquired from cervitech  which represents approximately million of the million total capitalized ipr d  has reached the two year follow up end point in its fda approved clinical trial in the united states

table of contents stock based compensation related to stock options is recognized and amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with authoritative guidance 
the increase in stock based compensation in of approximately million as compared to and million in as compared  can be attributed to an increase in number of option grants due to increased headcount year over year for all years presented and changes in valuation assumptions utilized in the black scholes option pricing model  most significantly  the market value of our common stock 
in addition  during  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which tend to have higher associated stock based compensation expense as they are valued at the full market price on the day of grant 
as of december   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense for stock options and rsus  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  respectively 
in addition  as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense for shares expected to be issued under the employee stock purchase plan which is expected to be recognized through october business combinations and asset acquisitions investment in progentix orthobiology  bv on january   we completed the purchase of forty percent of the capital stock of progentix orthobiology  bv  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands progentix  from existing shareholders the progentix shareholders pursuant to a preferred stock purchase agreement 
nuvasive  progentix and the progentix shareholders also entered into an option purchase agreement dated january  the option agreement  whereby i the progentix shareholders have two separate rights  upon the achievement of pre defined development milestones by progentix or sales milestones by us  to cause us to purchase the remaining sixty percent of capital stock of progentix remaining shares at pre defined prices the put options  and ii we have the right  upon the occurrence of pre defined events  to purchase the remaining sixty percent of capital stock of progentix the call option 
we also entered into a distribution agreement with progentix dated january   whereby progentix appointed us as its exclusive distributor for certain progentix products 
in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the fasb  we determined that progentix is a variable interest entity vie and that we are the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the financial position and results of operations of progentix have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the initial investment 
the equity interests in progentix not owned by us are reported as noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet 
losses incurred by progentix are charged to us and to the noncontrolling interest holders based on their ownership percentage 
the remaining shares and the option agreement that was entered into between us  progentix and the progentix shareholders are not considered to be freestanding financial instruments as defined by authoritative guidance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment portfolio which consists largely of debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers and the us government and its agencies 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
at december   we do not hold any material asset backed investment securities and in  we did not realize any losses related to asset backed investment securities 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount of our investment portfolio remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have operated mainly in the united states of america  and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have assessed that we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument
