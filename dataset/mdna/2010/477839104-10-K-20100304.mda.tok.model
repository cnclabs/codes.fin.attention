item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global technology solutions provider for the food processing and air transportation industries 
we design  manufacture  test and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers through our jbt foodtech and jbt aerotech segments 
we have established a large installed base of food processing equipment as well as airport equipment and have built a strong global presence with manufacturing  sourcing  sales and service organizations located on six continents to support equipment that has been delivered to more than countries 
we have developed close working relationships with our customers  which we believe enhances our competitive advantage  strengthens our market position and improves our results 
we serve customers from around the world 
during  more than half of our total sales were to locations outside of the united states 
we evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies 
the food processing and air transportation industries in which we operate are susceptible to significant changes in the strength of the global or regional economies 
this impacts the economic health of companies who make capital commitments for our products and services 
we focus on economic and industry specific drivers and key risk factors affecting each of our businesses as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources 
these factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook  product obsolescence  and the competitive environment 
our operations have historically achieved positive results 
however  due to the continued challenging economic environment we have seen a decrease in demand for some of our products  such as our jbt aerotech s ground support equipment 
continued weak demand for these products in future periods may result in impairment of goodwill and or long lived assets 
as of december   we believe that goodwill and long lived assets are not impaired  although we continue to monitor the results of our business units  especially ground support equipment 
as part of our core mission of being a leading supplier of customized solutions to the food processing and air transportation industries  we address these business related risks through our focus on four critical strategies of extending our technology leadership  leveraging our installed base  capturing international growth opportunities  and growing through acquisitions 
as we evaluate our operating results  we consider performance indicators like segment revenue and operating profit in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog 
separation from fmc technologies prior to july   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of fmc technologies 
on july   fmc technologies was separated into two independent publicly traded companies through the distribution of of its ownership of jbt corporation  containing the foodtech and airport systems businesses  to its shareholders the separation 
our capital structure and financial condition significantly changed at the date of the separation 
the financial statements prior to the separation do not reflect the debt or interest expense jbt corporation might have incurred if we were a stand alone company

jbt aerotech revenue decreased by million  primarily due to a decline in sales volume of our ground support equipment 
excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of million  jbt foodtech revenue decreased by million  primarily due to a decline in sales volume of our freezing and chilling products and protein processing products in europe and latin america 
additionally  gains on foreign currency transactions primarily related to derivative instruments resulted in million of higher revenue 
cost of sales was million lower in the twelve months ended december  compared to  while gross profit revenue less cost of sales decreased by million in the same period 
the decrease in gross profit was driven by lower sales volume  resulting in million of lower gross profit  and unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation  resulting in million of lower gross profit 
however  the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by improved profit margins due to a higher proportion of revenue from aftermarket parts and services along with product margin improvement in some of jbt aerotech s products  resulting in million of incremental gross profit  despite million of costs we incurred in related to our cost reduction programs 
additionally  gains on foreign currency transactions primarily related to derivative instruments resulted in million of incremental gross profit 
selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses were million lower in the twelve months ended december  compared to the reduction was driven by lower selling costs due to a decrease in sales volume and a reduction in staffing levels in our operations as a result of cost reduction programs 
other income  net was million in the twelve months ended december  compared to other expense  net of million in other income  net in was comprised of million of gains on investments in our non qualified deferred compensation plan and million of foreign currency gains 
other expense  net in was comprised primarily of million of losses on investments in our non qualified deferred compensation plan and million of losses on foreign currency transactions mostly allocated to us from our former parent 
net interest expense of million represents an increase of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to the expense in reflects the interest expense on the senior unsecured notes we issued and the credit facility we entered into in july in connection with the separation 
the expense in reflects interest expense on the senior unsecured notes and the credit facility for only the period after the separation  as we did not have significant amounts of debt outstanding prior to the separation 
income tax expense for the year ended december  resulted in an effective income tax rate of  compared to an effective rate of for the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a reversal of million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to one of our foreign operations 
compared with our total revenue increased million approximately in the twelve months ended december  compared to higher levels of air traffic in drove high demand for jbt aerotech equipment resulting in a strong backlog at the end of increased sales of gate equipment to airlines and airport authorities and ground support equipment to airfreight and ground handling companies contributed approximately million in incremental product revenue 
however  the downturn in the economic environment had a negative impact on sales of our food processing equipment  resulting in a decrease in revenue of million 
lower sales of food processing equipment were primarily due to lower demand for freezing and protein processing equipment from meat  dairy and other ready to eat meal processors  particularly in north america 
our service revenue increased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to we executed new contracts with major us airport authorities and expanded services and the amount of aftermarket products and parts we provide to our large base of freezing and protein processing customers 
favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million in increased revenue 
although cost of sales were higher in the twelve months ended december  compared to  gross profit revenue less cost of sales increased by million  as gross profit margins improved slightly from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses were million lower in the twelve months ended december  compared to excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million 
we were able to better leverage selling  general and administrative expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in other income expense  net  reflects primarily gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on investments in our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
in the twelve months ended december   we had a loss of million on the investments 
the remaining increase in other expense  net in compared to was driven primarily by the strengthening of the us dollar 
net interest expense was million in compared to net interest income of million in the expense in reflects five months of interest expense on senior unsecured notes we issued and the credit facility we entered into in connection with the separation 
we did not have significant amounts of debt outstanding in the periods prior to the separation 
income tax expense for the year ended december  resulted in an effective income tax rate of  compared to an effective rate of for the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the geographical mix of earnings in lower taxed jurisdictions 
discontinued operations we have reported two businesses within discontinued operations  one of which was sold in for a gain  net of tax  of million 
offsetting this gain were operating losses of million  including restructuring expenses and asset valuation provisions of million from a second discontinued business which ceased operations in the first quarter of changes in retirement benefits in september  we amended the retirement benefits offered to our employees in an attempt to reduce the future financial risk of our defined benefit pension plans and provide a competitive and sustainable retirement program that allows us to successfully attract and retain a skilled workforce 
effective january   we discontinued future benefit accruals for active non union participants in our domestic defined benefit pension plans as of december  and froze future participation in our domestic defined benefit pension plans by non union employees 
additionally  effective january   we enhanced our defined contribution savings plans by adding a company non elective contribution with immediate vesting to all eligible non union employees in addition to the current company match of up to that vests over time 
as a result of the amendments to our domestic defined benefit pension plans  we recognized a curtailment gain of million to recognize all previously unrecognized prior service benefits 
additionally  as a result of discontinuing future benefit accruals for active non union employees  our projected benefit obligation was reduced by million 
outlook we anticipate improved market conditions for many of our product lines in however  smaller projects and longer project lead times have limited our visibility into we expect the cost of our retirement benefits to decrease by million in  primarily as a result of the changes we made in our retirement benefits

jbt foodtech compared with jbt foodtech s revenue of million represented a decrease of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to continued challenging economic conditions in europe and latin america affected sales of our jbt foodtech products 
sales of our freezing and chilling products and protein processing products declined in europe by million and in latin america by million 
however  sales of our freezing and chilling products and protein processing products in asia increased by million 
sales of our freezing and chilling products and protein processing products in north america increased by million in the ready meals market and by million in the poultry market driven by shipments of large orders in  however these increases were offset by lower sales in the meat and other markets 
sales of our in container and fruit processing product lines improved slightly compared to the prior year period due to completion of large projects 
unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation resulted in million of lower revenue 
the remaining difference was primarily due to favorable impact of foreign currency transactions 
jbt foodtech s operating profit of million represented a decrease of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to lower sales volume resulted in million of lower profits 
however  profit margins improved due to a higher proportion of revenue from aftermarket parts and services resulting in million of incremental profits  despite million of restructuring charges 
research and development costs decreased by million while general and administrative costs decreased by million primarily due to a cost reduction program we implemented in the first quarter of selling costs decreased by million primarily due to lower sales volume 
the remaining difference was primarily due to an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
compared with jbt foodtech s revenue decreased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  revenue decreased by million 
the downturn in the economic environment in north america affected the demand for our freezing and protein processing equipment resulting in a decrease of million in sales to customers in all food markets except the poultry market  where sales increased by million 
increased demand for our freezing and protein processing equipment in europe partially offset the decrease in north america and contributed million in incremental revenue 
lower demand for our tomato and fruit processing equipment resulted in a decrease in revenue of million  which was partially offset by million of incremental revenue due to higher demand for our citrus processing equipment 
lower demand for our in container food processing equipment resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
jbt foodtech s operating profit increased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to improved gross profit margins contributed million in higher profits as we provided more aftermarket products  parts and services  which were partially offset by million due to a decrease in equipment sales 
additionally  a decrease of million in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase of million in research and development costs 
foreign currency translation of revenue and operating expenses had a favorable impact of million 
jbt aerotech compared with jbt aerotech s revenue of million represented a decrease of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to continued weak demand for our ground support equipment due to the global recession  combined with very strong results in driven by conversion of year end order backlog  resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
lower sales of our gate equipment products resulted in a decrease in revenue of million primarily driven by fewer shipments of pre conditioned air units to the us military 
higher sales of our halvorsen loaders resulted in an increase in revenue of million  but were mostly offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
jbt aerotech s operating profit of million represented a decrease of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to lower sales volume resulted in a decrease in profits of million 
however  profit margins improved by percentage points due to a more favorable product mix resulting in million of incremental gross profit  despite million in restructuring charges 
selling costs decreased by million primarily due to lower sales volume 
research and development costs decreased by million while general and administrative costs decreased by million primarily due to a cost reduction program we implemented in the first quarter of compared with jbt aerotech s revenue increased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to higher levels of air traffic in drove higher demand for our products  which resulted in a strong backlog at the end of compared to year end these orders were converted into sales in which resulted in higher revenue for ground support equipment  contributing million of incremental revenue  and passenger boarding bridges and related gate equipment  contributing million in incremental revenue 
additionally  the continuing trend by airport authorities and airlines to outsource maintenance and other non core services contributed million of incremental revenue 
increased shipments of our halvorsen cargo loaders and services provided to various branches of the us department of defense and foreign governments contributed million of incremental revenue in compared to jbt aerotech s operating profit increased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to higher sales volume contributed million in higher profits  which were partially offset by million due to higher steel costs  an increase of million in selling costs primarily due to commissions paid and an increase of million in research and development costs  primarily for energy efficient improvements 
gross profit margins declined slightly  while operating profit margins improved slightly as we were able to better leverage selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate items compared with corporate items of million represented a decrease of million in the twelve months ended december  compared to the decrease is driven by the impact of foreign currency transactions 
in the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue designating our new foreign currency derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
therefore  during all changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in earnings 
foreign currency transactions resulted in million of gains in compared to million of losses in the gains in were driven by the weakening of the us dollar primarily against the brazilian real 
the impact of foreign currency transactions was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the interest expense in reflects the interest expense on the senior unsecured notes we issued and the credit facility we entered into in july in connection with the separation 
the expense in reflects interest expense on the senior unsecured notes and the credit facility for only the period after the separation  as we did not have significant amounts of debt outstanding prior to the separation 
compared with corporate items of million represented an increase of million the twelve months ended december  compared to the increase was primarily driven by million of interest expense in compared to million of interest income in the expense in reflects five months of interest expense on debt incurred as a result of the separation 
the increase in corporate items was also due to an increase of million in corporate expense  reflecting higher stand alone corporate costs since the separation and onetime costs in establishing the corporate office 
inbound orders and order backlog inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the reporting period 
inbound orders year ended december  in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech other and intercompany eliminations total inbound orders order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders at the reporting date 
order backlog december  in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech intercompany eliminations total order backlog order backlog in our jbt foodtech segment at december  decreased by million since year end  due to completion of major poultry orders during the period and fewer orders for our freezing and chilling products and protein processing products 
we expect to convert the entire jbt foodtech backlog at december  into revenue during order backlog in our jbt aerotech segment at december  decreased by million since year end the decrease is driven by fewer orders of our ground support equipment due to economic conditions facing airline and airfreight industries and fewer orders of our automated systems products due to economic conditions facing the automotive industry 
we expect to convert approximately percent of the jbt aerotech backlog at december  into revenue during during  we corrected an immaterial error in the calculation of our order backlog  which resulted in a reduction of million in order backlog reported as of december  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and our credit facility 
we believe cash flows from operations and the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors 
cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended on december  were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided by continuing operating activities cash required by continuing investing activities cash required by financing activities cash provided by discontinued operations effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows provided by continuing operating activities in were million  representing a million decrease compared to the decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities was driven by an million decrease in income from continuing operations and higher pension plan contributions 
during  we contributed million to our domestic pension plans compared to million during cash flows from continuing operating activities in were million higher than in primarily due to better utilization of working capital 
majority of our investing activities support the maintenance and upgrading of our installed base of leased equipment 
our annual capital spending typically ranges from million to million 
our financing activities in consisted primarily of payments to reduce our debt by million 
our financing activities in consisted primarily of million of proceeds from issuance of debt to fund a distribution payment to our former parent in connection with the separation 
financing arrangements we have a million revolving credit facility with a consortium of financial institutions at december  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at libor or an alternative base rate  which is the greater of jpmorgan chase  na s prime rate or federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin dependent on our leverage ratio 
we are required to make periodic interest payments on the borrowed amounts and pay an annual facility fee ranging from to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility expires on july  as of december   we had million drawn on the credit facility  approximately million in letters of credit issued under the credit facility and approximately million of additional available funds 
we have an interest rate swap which fixes the annual interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the credit facility at plus a margin dependent on our leverage ratio 
for the period from july  to january   the interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on million of our borrowings and for the period from january  to january   the interest rate swap fixes the interest on million of our borrowings 
additionally  we have million of senior unsecured notes 
the senior unsecured notes are due on july  and require us to make semiannual interest payments 
our credit agreement and notes include restrictive covenants that  if not met  could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines  requirement to repay our borrowings and or a significant increase in our cost of financing 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our contractual obligations as shown in the following table debt instrument covenant measurement result as of december  revolving credit facility interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than capital expenditures not greater than million million dividends paid not greater than million million senior unsecured notes interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than interest coverage ratio is a comparison of the trailing twelve months consolidated ebitda  defined as net income plus interest expense plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization plus non cash expenses and extraordinary  unusual and non recurring items  to trailing twelve months interest expense 
leverage ratio is a comparison of the total indebtedness  defined as total debt plus guarantees of indebtedness of others plus obligations under financial letters of credit issued against the credit facility  to the trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda  as defined above 
capital expenditures are limited to million plus percent of unutilized amount from prior year 
we expect to remain in compliance with all restrictive covenants in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global economic conditions will not impair our ability to meet our restrictive covenants  or the volatility in the capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
outlook we plan to meet our cash requirements in future periods with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
on february   the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  or approximately million 
the dividend will be paid on march  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  we estimate that we will contribute approximately million in to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily reflecting discretionary contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
we continue to evaluate acquisitions in the normal course of business which we expect to fund with cash generated from operations or borrowings under our credit agreements 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in millions total payments less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases unconditional purchase obligations b pension and other postretirement benefits c total contractual obligations a our available long term debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants described in the previous section 
any violations of covenants or other events of default  which are not waived or cured  could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financial arrangements 
b in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services 
these agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier 
as substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders  the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our combined statements of income 
c we expect to make approximately million in contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during this amount primarily reflects discretionary contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time 
the following is a summary of other off balance sheet arrangements at december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total amount less than year years years after years other off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit and bank guarantees surety bonds total other off balance sheet arrangements to provide required security regarding our performance on certain contracts  we provide letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees  for which we are contingently liable 
in order to obtain these financial instruments  we pay fees to various financial institutions in amounts competitively determined in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off balance sheet financial instruments 
our off balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed  revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment 
historically  our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent  consequently  management believes it is not likely that there will be claims against these commitments that would result in a negative impact on our key financial ratios or our ability to obtain financing 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive a portion of our revenue from multiple element arrangements 
this requires that we determine whether the deliverables in these arrangements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract price should be allocated to each element 
we analyze our contracts to determine the appropriate accounting 
we recognize revenue on separate deliverables under an arrangement when a the undelivered product or service is not essential to the functionality of the delivered product or service or b there is evidence of fair value of each undelivered product or service 
otherwise  revenue on delivered elements is deferred until undelivered elements are delivered 
our ability to continue to recognize revenue for separate deliverables may depend on the nature of changes to our products and services  if any  which may result in different conclusions regarding fair value or importance of undelivered elements to delivered items functionality 
the allocation of contract revenue to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  we evaluate each component of inventory on a regular basis to determine whether it is excess or obsolete 
we record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period in which it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have not demonstrated usage within the most recent two year period 
this list is then reviewed with sales  production and materials management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate 
management considers as part of this evaluation whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods  whether there will be future demand for on hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
then management assigns a reserve requirement  which is determined based on its assessment of cost recoverability  to the items on the candidate listing 
as a result  our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
since the determination of the reserve requirement is based on management judgment rather than a formulaic approach  we are unable to quantify with a high level of precision the effect that a change in demand assumptions would have on management s assessment of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve  although lower demand assumptions would generally result in an increase in excess and obsolete inventory 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
significant judgment is applied when determining the fair value of a reporting unit 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value 
the income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts for each respective reporting unit 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches  and customer sales commitments 
we also apply judgment when selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
in we did not recognize any goodwill impairments as the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their respective carrying amounts 
however  due to the continued challenging economic environment impacting the demand for jbt aerotech s ground support equipment  we believe our ground support equipment reporting unit gse is the most sensitive to changes in inherent assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value 
as of december   gse contained million of goodwill 
in the test performed as of october   the fair value of gse was estimated based on a cash flow model using management s business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for the next five years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
our projections assume a moderate recovery in the airline and airfreight industry in the next two years and a substantial recovery in however  lowering revenue projections due to a slower industry recovery or a permanent decrease in capital expenditures by our customers would significantly impact gse s valuation 
for example  lowering revenue projection for by more than  which would result in a downward shift of all future revenue projections  would result in a potential impairment 
alternatively  assuming the airline and airfreight industry continues a steady moderate recovery in without a significant recovery in future years would also result in a potential impairment 
the fair value of gse exceeded the net asset carrying value by more than as of october  there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring management s judgment in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of goodwill impairment including projecting revenues and profits  interest rates  the cost of capital  tax rates  the corporation s stock price  and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain level 
we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits as well as claims under our self insured healthcare plans 
the obligations associated with the incurred losses are determined using actuarial estimates 
these estimates are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for medical costs  environmental hazards  and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change which could potentially be material to our results of operation and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches  and customer sales commitments 
significant changes in the expected realizability of the net deferred tax assets would require that we adjust the valuation allowance  resulting in a change to net income 
as of december   we estimated that it is not likely that we will realize income tax deductions for certain uncollectible receivables and  therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
we have estimated that it is likely that we will generate future taxable income in the us and most foreign jurisdictions  and have therefore not provided a valuation allowance against most of our deferred tax assets 
retirement benefits we provide most of our employees with certain retirement pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
these accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure 
different estimates used by management could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
we use third party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets 
they are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management s judgment and can materially affect net income 
pension expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense reported in the periods prior to the separation includes an allocation of expense from fmc technologies 
the discount rate used affects the periodic recognition of the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate is based on rates at which the pension benefit obligation could effectively be settled on a present value basis 
to determine the weighted average discount rate  we review long term  high quality corporate bonds at december of each year and use a model that matches the projected benefit payments for our plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds 
significant changes in the discount rate  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds  and the timing of expected benefit payments may result in volatility in pension expense and pension liabilities 
our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of discount rate 
holding other assumptions constant  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase the annual pension expense by approximately million before taxes  while a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the annual pension expense by approximately million before taxes 
net periodic pension cost includes an underlying expected long term rate of asset return 
our estimate of the expected rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on the historical performance of plan assets  current market conditions  our asset allocation and long term growth expectations 
our estimated long term rate of asset return at december  was approximately 
the expected return on plan assets is recognized as part of the net periodic pension cost 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the expected remaining life of participants  so there is a lag time between the market s performance and its impact on plan results 
our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of expected rate of return on plan assets 
holding other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately million before taxes 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board issued the accounting standard update  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the objective of the update is to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
the update establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities and addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the update is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
additionally  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in order to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments where the objective is to generate profits solely from trading activities 
at december  and  our derivative holdings consisted of foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency instruments embedded in purchase and sale contracts and an interest rate swap agreement 
these forward looking disclosures address potential impacts from market risks only as they affect our financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  our foreign subsidiaries generated approximately of our revenue  driven by our operations in sweden which generated approximately of our revenue 
financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is not the functional currency are translated into us dollars 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk 
when we sell or purchase products or services  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than an operation s functional currency 
when foreign currency exposures exist  we may enter into foreign exchange forward instruments with third parties to economically hedge foreign currency exposures 
our hedging policy reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting for our foreign currency forward instruments 
we economically hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect any gains or losses in the hedging portfolio to be substantially offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
we also economically hedge firmly committed anticipated transactions in the normal course of business 
as these are not offset by an underlying balance sheet position being hedged  our earnings can be significantly impacted on a periodic basis by the change in unrealized value of these hedges 
we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an immediate adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and all other variables are held constant 
we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments will offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
a adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the value of our derivative instruments for which we do not apply hedge accounting by approximately million as of december  this amount would be reflected in our net income but would be significantly offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk our debt instruments subject us to market risk associated with movements in interest rates 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  we have entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap related to a portion of the variable rate debt 
the swap provides for payment at an average fixed interest rate of plus a margin dependent on our leverage ratio until its maturity on january  for the period from july  to january   the notional amount of the swap is million 
for the period from january  to january   the notional amount of the swap is million 
we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on fair value of the interest rate swap of an immediate adverse movement in the interest rates of basis points 
this analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a basis point change in interest rates 
this adverse change in the applicable interest rates would result in an increase of million in the net fair value of our interest rate swap at december  we account for the interest rate swap using hedge accounting where the fair value of the swap is recorded in other accumulated income and is amortized into income as variable interest expense is recorded 
at december  we had million of unhedged variable rate debt 
using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a adverse movement in the interest rate  or basis points  would result in an immaterial increase to the annual interest expense
