item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices  and changes in technology that reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
we believe the downturn in the oil and gas industry that began in late brought on by the rapid decline in oil and gas prices has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business 
in july of  the price of oil exceeded a barrel  but fell below a barrel in early as a result  oil and gas producers have had substantial reductions in their cash flows  thus causing most to slash their capital budgets for and the dollar value of projects  if available in the market  is significantly below pre levels and our backlog is similarly eroded 
other projects have been removed from the bidding process as these companies wait for potential increases in commodity prices 
competition for available projects has become intense and future short term margins have and will likely diminish 
cost reduction measures have been and continue to be undertaken as appropriate to meet these conditions 
in the longer term  demand for our products and services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas  which at this time is difficult to predict 
at some point however  we expect that oil and gas prices will recover as commodity supplies are reduced and our customers are forced to replace them 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to  those projects as to which a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchased materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on incomplete engineering and design specifications 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete and price at completion for such projects is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer in that case is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
however  due to the large dollar amounts of backlog estimated for certain projects  a termination of any one of these projects could substantially decrease our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  net income and cash flow 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  which consists of work remaining at december  and commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported in our form k at december  our backlog at december   was adjusted to reflect the removal of million and million man hours associated with the mindoc ii project in which the customer had announced has been postponed indefinitely 
of the backlog at december   million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  of projects destined for deepwater locations included in the december  backlog 
of the backlog at december   we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million during calendar year and million during calendar year

index to financial statements workforce during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to contract laborers 
current global economic conditions and a steep decline in oil prices have caused companies to remove projects from the bidding process or reduce the dollar value of projects 
as a result  we began to reduce our headcount in these efforts have continued through early  and  as of march   we had approximately  employees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a particular capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity  such as depreciation  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
these indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
at december   we recorded revenue totaling  related to certain change orders  which have been approved as to scope but not price 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the following factors contributed to the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  significant jobs have not been added to the backlog for several quarters 
pass through cost decreased from of revenue for the twelve month period ended december  to for the twelve month period ended december   see footnote to the consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements the amount of man hours worked decreased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million during the twelve month period ended december   representing a decrease of at december   we recorded revenue totaling  related to certain change orders on one project which have been approved as to scope but not price 
although we believe the collection of this change order is probable based on past experience  we are in the process of negotiating resolution of these change orders with the customer  and recovery of the revenue is dependent upon these negotiations 
if we collect an amount different than the  of revenue that has been recorded  that difference will be recognized as income or loss as applicable 
we expect to resolve these matters in the first quarter of for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue for and million of revenue for factors contributing to the increase in gross margin percentage for the twelve months ended december  activity levels in allowed us to decrease our reliance on contract labor used to supplement our labor force necessary to complete the major projects in progress 
generally  contract labor employees perform less efficiently than company employees  which is normally due to the amount of training  work experience and turnover 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  a reduction of 
during the twelve months ended december   contract labor represented of billable man hours  compared to for the twelve months ended december  currently  the total number of contract employees in all facilities is cost reduction measures  including a reduction in overhead labor costs  were undertaken since the fourth quarter of to meet the decline in economic conditions we experienced during our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenue compared to of revenue for the twelve month periods ended december  and the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
also contributing to the reduction of general and administrative costs was a reduction in professional service fees 
we had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily related to the amortization of the discount associated with the financing arrangement with bluewater and atp on the fabrication of the mindoc i hull  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the increase from the previous twelve month period is the result of the limitations on certain federal manufacturing tax credits based on our estimated tax provision for  a reduction in the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc available to us in and a slight increase in state taxes related to an increase in the state taxable income apportionment 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements primary factor contributing to this reduction of revenue was the fact that actual material and sub contract costs incurred pass through cost represented of sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to of sales for the twelve months ended december  thus  the majority of the decrease in revenue is associated with the reduction of material and subcontract cost incurred on projects for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  we consider material and sub contract costs associated with projects as pass through costs because they become a component of revenue  but add little or no margin to a project 
partially offsetting this reduction in revenue was an increase in the billable labor man hours on projects during the year 
for the twelve month period ended december   direct labor man hours were million compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue for and million of revenue for two factors contributed to the increase in gross margin for the twelve months ended december  most of our revenue is recognized by using the percentage of completion method  computed by the efforts expended method  which measures the percentage of labor hours incurred compared to the total estimated labors hours to complete a contract 
consequently  the increase in direct labor man hours million compared to million as mentioned above resulted in an increase in gross margin 
activity levels in required us to increase our reliance on contract labor to maintain sufficient labor levels to complete the major projects in progress 
generally  contract labor employees perform less efficiently than company employees  which is normally due to the amount of training  work experience and turnover 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  a reduction of 
currently  the total number of contract employees in all facilities has been reduced to our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenue for each of the twelve month periods ended december  and the majority of the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was related to amortization expense 
we incurred amortization expense  through august  which was related to the gulf marine acquisition 
also contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses was a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
we had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december  the reduction in interest income is related to having less cash available for investing combined with lower interest rates earned on investments in compared to our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the decrease in the tax rate is primarily related to the extension and retroactive application of the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our business activities through funds generated from operations 
effective june   we entered into the eighth amendment to the ninth amended and restated credit agreement the revolver which  among other things  extended the term of the million revolver from december  to december  the revolver is secured by our real estate  machinery and equipment  and fixtures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements amounts borrowed under the revolver bear interest  at our option  at the prime lending rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor plus 
we pay a fee on a quarterly basis of one fourth of one percent per annum on the weighted average unused portion of the revolver 
at december   no amounts were borrowed under the revolver  but we had letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which reduced the unused portion of the revolver 
more of our customers  especially in larger fabrication projects  are requiring us to issue letters of credit in lieu of retainage 
we are required to maintain certain covenants  including balance sheet and cash flow ratios  and as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
on july   we reached an agreement with bluewater industries  inc bluewater to restructure the payment terms for the remainder of the amounts owed on the mindoc i project 
bluewater  an engineering consulting firm  is contracted with atp to oversee the fabrication of the mindoc i hull and topsides 
the amount owed to us on the project at the time of the arrangement was million 
an additional million was billed on the project under this arrangement through completion  which occurred in stages during the th quarter of additional changes in the scope of the project in excess of the agreed upon million were approved by bluewater and atp through change orders 
such change orders will be paid in cash and will not be part of this payment agreement 
bluewater agreed to pay million of the amount owed in seven equal installments of million each  with the first payment due september  and each subsequent payment due on the th day of each calendar month through march  any such installment that is not paid when due shall bear interest as provided in the master services agreement between bluewater and us 
we have received million in payments from bluewater through march   representing of the amounts owed to us as of such date 
bluewater agreed to pay the remaining million owed to us pursuant to the assignment of all of its right  title and interest in the conveyance of overriding royalty interest between bluewater and atp 
the interest we received from bluewater is a limited overriding royalty interest because the amount to be received by us is set not to exceed million 
upon cumulative receipt of the million  the limited overriding royalty will revert back to bluewater 
originally  we projected that we will start receiving royalty payments from this limited overriding royalty interest in february  and we anticipated the entire million to be paid over a thirteen month period based on our review of petroleum engineering reserve reports applying strip prices in effect in mid june based on a delay in the project s first production  we now project that we will start receiving royalty payments in mid year over a fourteen month period 
strip prices for oil and gas as of march  are in excess of the mid june prices used to previously estimate the repayment period 
while we believe the available oil and gas reserves for the properties subject to our limited overriding royalty interest significantly exceed million  we have no guarantees from bluewater or atp if the limited overriding royalty interest does not fund the million balance 
to the extent the limited overriding royalty interest does not fund all or a part of the million  we will be required to recognize a charge against earnings  which may be significant depending on the shortfall 
the cash flows we expect to receive from the limited overriding royalty interest are sensitive to the normal risks associated with oil and gas production such as changes in the price of oil and gas  the amount of oil and gas produced  increases in the expenses associated with producing the oil and gas and changes in the anticipated production schedule 
these cash flows can be adversely affected by a decline in the price of oil and gas or production level of the oil and gas wells being serviced by the mindoc i hull and topsides 
also  the estimates of crude oil and gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions  including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates 
any material change in those conditions  or other factors affecting those assumptions  could impair the quantity and value of oil and gas reserves 
as a result of these risks  the payments we expect to receive from this agreement have been discounted using interest rates ranging from to with a discounted amount of million included in our final estimated contract price on this project 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
working capital was million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the overall decrease in cash provided by operations for the period ended december   compared to the period ended december  is mainly due to the decreased operating activity in which generated less revenue 
an increase in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million relating to one customer s contract also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
we have billed and collected million of this amount through march  we expect to bill and collect the remainder of this balance in the second quarter of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was million  which related to capital expenditures of million for equipment and improvements to our production facilities and million of proceeds on the sale of equipment 
included in capital expenditures for was million related to the remaining phase ii cost to complete the graving dock at our gulf marine facilities and million representing approximately one fifth of the cost of constructing a gate for the graving dock 
the graving dock gate will be completed in june also included in capital expenditures for were million to complete the panel line system and million on the dry dock as described in items and business and property 
our board of directors approved a capital budget of approximately million for  which includes the purchase of equipment and additional yard and facility infrastructure improvements 
the capital expenditure budget has been reduced in compared to the because of current global economic conditions in the industry 
capital projects could further be reduced if available work in the market declines further 
included in the capital expenditure budget is million for the completion of the graving dock gate located in our gulf marine facilities 
the gate will allow us to open and close the entrance of the graving dock within a few days opposed to a few weeks which it currently takes to pull and drive sheet piles each time the graving dock is used 
we believe the new gate will improve our efficiency and enhance services to our customers through a shorter dock turn around 
also included is million for a fab shop and warehouse in the west yard of our gulf island facilities to further expand our marine construction and repair activities 
we believe these facilities will allow gulf island marine to become fully operational and improve its operations by becoming more centralized and efficient 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   was million  relating to cash used to pay dividends on shares of our common stock 
the agreed restructure of payments on the mindoc i project discussed above  which extended the payment term on this project  has caused a significant reduction in cash available to us 
an adverse change in the anticipated payment stream from bluewater could cause an additional strain on our liquidity and other resources 
also  job awards may require us to issue additional letters of credit further reducing the capacity available on our revolver 
however  we believe that during the next months our cash generated by operating activities and funds available under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet our working capital needs 
we may expand our operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing which we believe would be available to us
