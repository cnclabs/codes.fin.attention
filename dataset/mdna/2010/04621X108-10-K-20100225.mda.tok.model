item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reinsurance 
for at least of our  of reinsurance recoverables at december   we are protected from the credit risk by using various types of risk mitigation mechanisms such as trusts  letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement 
for example  reserves of  and  as of december  relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with the hartford and john hancock  respectively  related to sales of businesses are held in trusts 
if the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities  the hartford and john hancock  as the case may be  will be required to put more assets in the trusts 
we may be dependent on the financial condition of the hartford and john hancock  whose am best ratings are currently a and a  respectively 
am best maintains a negative outlook on the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of the hartford 
the am best ratings of john hancock are stable 
for recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms  we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer 
occasionally  the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable 
see item a risk factors risks related to our company reinsurance may not be available or adequate to 
table of contents protect us against losses  and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers and we have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent 
we believe that a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated a or better by am best 
inflation risk inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets  which are not indexed to the level of inflation  whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation 
approximately of assurant preneed s insurance policies with reserves of  as of december  have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the cpi 
in times of rapidly rising inflation  the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings 
we have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing contracts with payments tied to the cpi 
see derivatives 
in addition  we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation  and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations  mainly in canada 
we also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the canadian dollar  primarily the british pound and brazilian real 
however  total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than of our total invested assets at december  foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency 
we have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
the foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity securities denominated in canadian dollars  whose balance was  of the total  on our entire fixed maturity portfolio is summarized in the following table foreign exchange movement analysis of market value of fixed maturity securities assets as of december  foreign exchange spot rate at december   us dollar to canadian dollar total market value change of market value from base case change of market value from base case 
table of contents the foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our consolidated net income is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume earnings in canadian dollars are recognized evenly throughout a period 
our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology

derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments 
we have purchased contracts to cap the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our preneed insurance policies 
in accordance with the guidance on embedded derivatives  which is within asc topic  we have bifurcated the modified coinsurance agreement with the hartford into its debt host and embedded derivative total return swap and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement are included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheets
