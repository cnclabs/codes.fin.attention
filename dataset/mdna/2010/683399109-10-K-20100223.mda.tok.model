overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
through our internal research programs and in conjunction with our collaborators  we are applying our expertise to develop and commercialize therapies designed to exploit the genetic and molecular differences between cancer cells and normal cells with the goal of changing the way cancer is treated tm 
we are focusing on this goal as we continue to maximize current commercialization opportunities for nexavar sorafenib tablets  along with our collaborator  bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer 
in addition  we continue to expand our development pipeline  with several clinical and preclinical stage product candidates 
our first commercially available product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  being developed with our collaborator  bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer  is approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer 
nexavar is a novel  orally available kinase inhibitor and is one of a new class of anticancer treatments that target both cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through the inhibition of key signaling pathways 
in december  nexavar became the first newly approved drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer in over a decade 
in november  nexavar was approved as the first and is currently the only systemic therapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer 
nexavar is now approved in more than countries for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and in more than countries for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer 
we and bayer are also conducting clinical trials of nexavar in several important cancer types in addition to advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer  including lung  thyroid  breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
we and bayer are commercializing nexavar  for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
nexavar has been approved and is marketed for these indications in the united states and in the european union and in other territories worldwide 
in the united states  we co promote nexavar with bayer 
outside of the united states  bayer manages all commercialization activities 
in  worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were million 
in collaboration with bayer  we initially focused on demonstrating nexavar s ability to benefit patients suffering from a cancer for which there were no or few established therapies 
with the approval of nexavar for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer  the two companies have established the nexavar brand and created a global commercial oncology presence 
in order to benefit as many patients as possible  we and bayer are investigating the administration of nexavar with previously approved anticancer therapies in more common cancers  with the objective of enhancing the anti tumor activity of existing therapies through combination with nexavar 
we and bayer are developing and marketing nexavar under our collaboration and co promotion agreements 
we fund of the development costs for nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
with bayer  we co promote nexavar in the united states and share equally in any profits or losses 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer has exclusive marketing rights and we share profits equally 
in japan  bayer funds all product development  and we will receive a royalty on any sales 
our collaboration agreements with bayer also provided that we receive creditable milestone based payments totaling million  all of which have been received 
these payments are repayable by us to bayer from a portion of our share of any quarterly collaboration profits and royalties after deducting certain contractually agreed upon expenditures 
as of december   the entire amount of these development payments was paid back to bayer based on the profitability of the collaboration thus far 
in november  we made a significant move towards achieving our goal in becoming a multi product portfolio company by acquiring proteolix  inc  or proteolix  a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in south san francisco  california 
proteolix focused primarily on the discovery and development of novel therapies that target the proteasome for the treatment of hematological malignancies  solid tumors and autoimmune disorders 
this acquisition  which included carfilzomib  has provided us with an opportunity to expand into the hematological malignancies market 
the aggregate cash consideration to former proteolix stockholders at closing was million 
in addition  we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earnout payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
we have expanded our development pipeline through the acquisition of rights to development stage novel anticancer agents 
in november  we entered into an agreement to license worldwide development and commercialization rights to onx  previously known as bgc  from btg international limited  or btg  a london based specialty pharmaceuticals company 
onx is in preclinical development and is believed to work by combining two established approaches to improve outcomes for cancer patients  selectively targeting tumor cells through the alpha folate receptor  which is overexpressed in a number of tumor types  and inhibiting thymidylate synthase  a key enzyme responsible for cell growth and division 
in september  we initiated phase studies of onx in advanced solid tumors  triggering a million milestone payment to btg 
in december  we acquired options to license sb designated by onyx as onx and sb designated by onyx as onx  which are both janus kinase  or jak  inhibitors  from s bio pte ltd  or s bio  a singapore based company 
the activation of jak stimulates blood cell production and the jak pathway is known to play a critical role in the proliferation of certain types of cancer cells and in the anti inflammatory pathway 
s bio is conducting trials for onx in multiple phase studies  and in february  s bio initiated two phase trials using onx in myelofibrosis 
onx is currently in preclinical development 
in december  our collaborator  warner lambert company  now a subsidiary of pfizer inc  initiated a phase clinical trial administering pd  a small molecule cell cycle inhibitor resulting from our collaboration that targets a cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk in accordance with our collaboration agreement  we earned a million milestone payment due from pfizer 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have incurred net losses since our inception 
our ability to achieve continued and sustainable profitability is uncertain and is dependent on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the level of patient demand for nexavar  the ability of bayer s distribution network to process and ship product on a timely basis  investments in sales and marketing efforts to support the sales of nexavar  bayer and our investments in the research and development of nexavar  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expenditures we may incur to acquire or develop and commercialize additional products 
our operating results will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and are difficult to predict 
since inception  we have relied on public and private financings  combined with milestone payments from our collaborators  to fund our operations and may continue to do so in future periods 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients in approved indications  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
fasb accounting standards codification in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles gaap a replacement of sfas no 
 which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc as the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities 
this guidance is effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after september  we adopted the provisions of this guidance in the quarter ended september  and as a result  the majority of references to historically issued accounting pronouncements are now superseded by references to the fasb asc 
certain accounting pronouncements  such as sfas  will remain authoritative until they are integrated into the fasb asc 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of marketable securities  revenue from collaboration agreement  the effect of business combinations  fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  goodwill and other intangible assets  fair value of convertible senior notes  research and development expenses  stock based compensation related to stock options granted and the provision for income taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of corporate debt securities  corporate commercial paper  debt securities of united states government agencies  auction rate notes and money market funds and are classified as available for sale securities 
concentration of risk is limited by diversifying investments among a variety of industries and issuers 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with any unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for securities with unobservable quoted market prices  such as the aaa rated auction rate securities collateralized by student loans that are included in our investment portfolio  the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase or decrease in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease or increase in value 
unrealized losses are charged against investment income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to i the extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the cause for the fair value decline  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
available for sale securities with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
the cost of securities sold or the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in the statements of operations 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
revenue from collaboration agreement in accordance with asc subtopic  formerly known as emerging issues task force  or eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements  we record our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from the collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue in one line item  revenue from collaboration agreement 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the line item revenue from collaboration agreement  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
we and bayer each bear our own us sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these costs related to our us sales force and medical science liaisons are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
bayer recognizes all revenue under the nexavar collaboration and incurs the majority of expenses relating to the development and marketing of nexavar 
we are highly dependent on bayer for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of nexavar and the costs incurred in developing and selling it  in order to accurately report our results of operations 
if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of proteolix in accordance with asc topic  formerly known as sfas r  business combinations 
asc topic establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
the consideration paid to acquire proteolix is required to be measured at fair value and included cash consideration and contingent consideration  which are earnout payments that will be paid upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration plus the cash consideration  we assigned the purchase price of proteolix to the fair value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to in process research and development ipr d projects and goodwill 
the determination and allocation of the consideration transferred requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration and intangible assets acquired 
we believe the fair values assigned to our liability for contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these assets and liabilities  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates  the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risk associated with uncertainty  achievement and payment of the milestone events 
changes to any of these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for these assets and liabilities resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
fair value measurements in accordance with asc subtopic  formerly known as sfas fair value measurements  we measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using the three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring management to develop its own assumptions based on best estimates of what market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability at the reporting date 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  formerly known as sfas r  business combinations  and asc topic  formerly known as sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
asc topic requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies the criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
our intangible assets and goodwill are determined to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not amortized 
instead they are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred in accordance with asc topic judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators will be based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
convertible senior notes in august  we issued  through an underwritten public offering  million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc subtopic  formerly known as fasb staff position accounting principles board under asc subtopic issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the carrying amount of the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at a effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in our capital structure as well as taking into consideration effective interest rates derived by comparable companies 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and results in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
subsequently  the debt discount is amortized as interest expense through the maturity date of the notes 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation of stock options granted to employees and directors and of employee stock purchase plan shares by estimating the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and amortizing the fair value of the stock based awards granted over the applicable vesting period 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
we estimate expected volatility based upon a combination of historical and implied stock prices 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the expected option term calculation incorporates historical employee exercise behavior and post vesting employee termination rates 
we account for stock based compensation of restricted stock award grants by amortizing the fair value of the restricted stock awards grants  which is the grant date market price  over the applicable vesting period 
the net income for the years ended december  and includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
the net loss for the year ended december  includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation expense for unvested stock options  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
all stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  as calculated using the black scholes model 
the option arrangements are subject to periodic remeasurement over their vesting terms 
we recorded compensation expense related to option grants to non employees of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the stock based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december   and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
research and development expense research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
clinical trial expenses include  but are not limited to  investigator fees  site costs  comparator drug costs  clinical research organization costs 
in addition  our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  up front payment amounts are capitalized and expensed as services are performed or as the underlying goods are delivered 
if we do not expect the services to be rendered or goods to be delivered  any remaining capitalized amounts for non refundable up front payments are charged to expense immediately 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
non refundable option payments  including those made under our agreement with s bio  that do not have any future alternative use are recorded as research and development expense 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets  and record a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and the amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets despite achieving full year profitability in and  since  up until  we have had a history of annual losses since inception 
on a quarterly basis  we reassess our valuation allowance for deferred income taxes 
we will consider reducing the valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not the benefit of those assets will be realized 
as part of our accounting for the acquisition of proteolix  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  therefore  deferred taxes have been recorded for future non deductible amortization expenses related to intangible assets as a part of the business combination 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance under asc  formerly financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the financial statements 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of this guidance under asc had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows for the year ended december   and as we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar  our only marketed product  was approved in the united states in december in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the years ended december   and  we reported no revenue related to nexavar 
nexavar net sales as recorded by bayer were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily from sales in the united states and the european union 
contract revenue from collaborations 
contract revenue from collaborations was million in and zero in and contract revenue from collaborations in relates to a milestone fee earned when pfizer initiated phase clinical testing to advance a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement 
nexavar is currently approved in more than countries for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and in more than countries for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under collaboration and co promotion agreements 
in march  we and bayer entered into a co promotion agreement to co promote nexavar in the united states 
this agreement amends the collaboration agreement and supersedes the provisions of that agreement that relate to the co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
outside of the united states  the terms of the collaboration agreement continue to govern 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we and bayer share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide outside of japan and our continued co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
the collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and we reimburse bayer for half of those expenditures 
in addition  for sales generated outside of the united states  excluding japan  we reimburse bayer a fixed percentage of sales for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  excluding japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we receive a royalty on net sales of nexavar 
in the united sates  bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
we compensate bayer for distribution expenses based on a fixed percentage of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
we reimburse bayer for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold in the united states 
in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
we and bayer each bear our own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement consists of our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from our collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all sales of nexavar worldwide 
we record revenue from collaboration agreement on a quarterly basis 
revenue from collaboration agreement is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting the cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs and allocable overhead costs 
reimbursement by bayer of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue are also included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in this line item  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
united states sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the revenue from collaboration agreement during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ from these estimates 
if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
revenue from collaboration agreement increases with increased nexavar net revenue  or decreases with decreased nexavar net revenue  over and above the associated cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expenses 
increases to the associated costs of goods sold  distribution  selling and general and administrative expenses will decrease revenue from collaboration agreement and decreases to these costs will increase revenue from collaboration agreement 
we expect nexavar sales and bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase with the approval of nexavar for advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer as bayer continues to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities outside of the united states 
revenue from collaboration agreement was million  million and million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from collaboration agreement is primarily a result of increased net product revenue on sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the increase in net product revenue was offset by increased costs to sell  distribute and market in countries around the world 
revenue from collaboration agreement is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands nexavar product revenue  net as recorded by bayer  revenue subject to profit sharing as recorded by bayer  combined cost of goods sold  distribution  selling  general and administrative    combined collaboration commercial profit   onyx s share of collaboration commercial profit  reimbursement of onyx s shared marketing expenses  royalty income   revenue from collaboration agreement   research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  as compared to prior years were as follows change change for the year ending december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages research and development the increase in research and development expenses compared to is primarily due to planned increases in the development program for nexavar across additional tumor types  such as thyroid  colorectal and adjuvant liver cancer  as well as increased costs to further develop onx  including a milestone payment of million to btg  partially offset by decreased spending for lung cancer trials 
research and development expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in we expect that bayer and we will continue to expand our investment in the development of nexavar by conducting clinical trials to test nexavar s efficacy in more prevalent tumor types in future periods 
additionally  we expect our research and development activities to include developing carfilzomib  onx and our other product candidates 
the increase in research and development expenses when compared to was primarily due to million of upfront payments related to our development and license agreement with btg and development collaboration  option and license agreement with s bio and costs related to the phase breast trials 
research and development expenses also included lower stock based compensation of million in when compared to million in a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing

investment income  net 
investment income consists of interest income and realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments 
we had investment income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the same period in these decreases were primarily due to lower effective interest rates in the market as well as a change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio 
excluding restricted cash of million attributable to the escrow account for the acquisition of proteolix  our average cash balances in increased by million from  primarily as a result of net proceeds raised by our notes and equity financings in august secondary offering from which we received million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  and cash from operations of million partially offset by total cash consideration of million paid to former proteolix stockholders as a result of our recent acquisition of proteolix 
we had investment income of million in  a decrease of million from  primarily due to lower interest rates from the change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio 
our average cash balances in benefited from our june sale of equity securities from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds  and our april sale of equity securities to azimuth opportunity ltd  or azimuth  from which we received approximately million

interest expense of million in primarily relates to the notes issued in august  and includes non cash imputed interest expense of million as a result of the application of asc subtopic  formerly known as fasb staff position accounting principles board income taxes 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have incurred significant losses since our inception and  as a result  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented prior to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively  related to continuing operations 
our tax expense was related primarily to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively  including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  as a result of the acquisition of proteolix  inc these net operating losses can be utilized to reduce future taxable income  if any 
approximately million of the federal and million of the state valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards representing the stock option deduction arising from activity under our stock option plan  the benefit of which will increase additional paid in capital when realized

acquired in process research and development intangible assets for in process research and development  or ipr d  consists primarily of product candidates resulting from our acquisition of proteolix  including carfilzomib  onx and onx we determined that the combined estimated fair values of carfilzomib  onx and onx was million as of november  we used an income approach  which is a measurement of the present value of the net economic benefit or cost expected to be derived from an asset or liability  to measure the fair value of carfilzomib and a cost approach to measure the fair values of onx and onx under the income approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after tax cash flows excess earnings attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 
under the cost approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the costs incurred to date to develop the asset to its current stage 
to calculate fair value of carfilzomib under the income approach  we used probability weighted cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with this type of asset 
we estimated the fair value of this asset using a present value discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of proteolix 
this is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for proteolix s operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value this asset 
cash flows were generally assumed to extend either through or beyond the patent life of the asset  depending on the circumstances particular to the asset 
in addition  we compensated for the phase of development for this program by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows 
we believe that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions 
the projected cash flows from this project were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the project considering its stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate  the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
the resultant probability weighted cash flows were then discounted using a rate we believe is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption 
for the other two intangible assets acquired  onx and  we used the costs incurred to date by proteolix to develop these assets to their current stage as their fair value as result of the lack of financial projections for these assets in their current development stages 
these ipr d programs represent proteolix s incomplete research and development projects which had not yet reached technological feasibility at acquisition 
a summary of these programs and estimated fair values at the acquisition date  as well as status of development is as follows estimated acquisition date fair value product candidates description in thousands carfilzomib first in a new class of selective and irreversible proteasome inhibitors associated with prolonged target suppression  improved antitumor activity and low neurotoxicity for treatment against multiple myeloma and solid tumors 
 onx oral proteasome inhibitor for treatment against hematologic and solid tumors 
 onx immunoproteasome inhibitor for treatment against rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease 
related party transactions our related parties consist of our directors and officers 
at december   we had a loan with a non executive employee of which  was outstanding 
the loan bears interest at per annum and is payable in a lump sum within eighteen months from the date of the loan 
liquidity and capital resources beginning with our fiscal years ended december   we began reporting net income from our operations  primarily as a result of revenues earned from sales of nexavar through our collaboration agreement with bayer 
prior to that  we had incurred significant losses since our inception and had relied primarily on public and private financing  combined with milestone payments we received from our collaborators  to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million  excluding million of restricted cash  compared to million at december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds raised by our notes and equity financings in august and cash from operations of million  partially offset by our cash payment  net of cash acquired  of million to former proteolix stockholders in conjunction with our acquisition of proteolix in november and a milestone payment to btg 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in is primarily due to million of upfront payments related to our development and license agreement with btg and development collaboration  option and license agreement with s bio partially offset by the remaining cash provided by operations and net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for the year ended december  in  our cash provided by operations was million  compared to cash used in operations of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the cash provided by operations primarily related to net income earned for the year 
in and  the cash used in operations primarily related to net losses for the and periods  respectively 
expenditures for capital equipment amounted to approximately million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in  and were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
in september  we secured a commitment for up to million in a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth 
during the two year term of the commitment  we were able to sell  at our discretion  registered shares of our common stock to azimuth at a discount to the market price ranging from to 
under this commitment  azimuth purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  or million 
in april  azimuth purchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million resulting in approximately million in net cash proceeds received by us 
in october and november  azimuth purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of million  resulting in approximately million in net cash proceeds received by us 
this commitment has expired and has no further availability remaining 
our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature  or auction rate securities  that are collateralized by student loans 
in january  million in securities were redeemed at par and  accordingly  we classified them as current marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  therefore  a remaining balance of million of par value auction rate securities is currently outstanding in our investment portfolio 
since february  these types of securities have experienced failures in the auction process 
however  a limited number of these securities have been redeemed at par by the issuing agencies 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified the auction rate securities with a par value of million as non current marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined the fair value to be million for these securities  based on a discounted cash flow model  and have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income loss instead of earnings because we have deemed the impairment of these securities to be temporary 
further adverse developments in the credit market could result in an impairment charge through earnings in the future 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of the assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
currently  we believe these investments are not other than temporarily impaired as all of them are substantially backed by the federal government  but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled 
we believe that  even after reclassifying these securities to non current assets and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash and current marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs beyond with our acquisition of proteolix  we anticipate our operating costs to increase in as we incur expenses towards the development of carfilzomib  onx and onx in addition  the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated october  provide that we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earnout payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
of this amount  we expect the first earnout payment of million to be paid in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations beyond however  if we change our development plans  including acquiring or developing additional product candidates or complementary businesses  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
we anticipate that our co development costs for the nexavar program may increase over the next several years as we continue to fund our share of the clinical development program and prepare for the potential product launches throughout the world 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur expenses for the development of onx and  if we exercise one or both of our options  onx and onx  we will be required to pay significant license fees and will incur development expenses 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the co funding of the program in future periods beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands convertible senior notes due liability for contingent consideration operating leases  net of sublease income the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated october  for the acquisition of proteolix provide that we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earnout payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
of this amount  we expect the first earnout payment of million to be paid in the remaining amount of million is not included in the above table as the timing and payment amounts are unknown

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
under our policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate notes  investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline or increase  respectively  by approximately million 
additionally  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in market interest rates for the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our investment income for the year ended december  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months our notes  with a total par value of million at december   bear interest at a fixed rate of 
due to the fixed interest rate  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price which may make the conversion of our notes to common stock beneficial to the holders of such notes 
conversion of the notes would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share 
liquidity risk our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated auction rate securities collateralized by student loans 
in january  million in securities were redeemed at par and  accordingly  we classified them as current marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  therefore  a remaining balance of million of par value auction rate securities is currently outstanding in our investment portfolio

foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of nexavar sales are generated outside of the united states  and a significant percentage of nexavar commercial and development expenses are incurred outside of the united states 
under our collaboration agreement  we are currently funding of mutually agreed development costs worldwide  excluding japan 
in all foreign countries  except japan  bayer first receives a portion of product revenues to repay bayer for its foreign commercialization infrastructure  after which we receive of net profits on sales of nexavar 
bayer is funding of development costs in japan and pays us a single digit royalty on nexavar sales in japan 
therefore  when these sales and expenses are translated into us dollars by bayer in determining amounts payable to us or payable by us  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary foreign currency in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure is the euro 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in exchange rates between the euro and us dollar during the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our net income for the year ended december  based on our expected exposure to the euro 
we utilize a euro to us dollar exchange rate based on average exchange rates for the reporting period 
as we expand  we could be exposed to exchange rate fluctuation in other currencies 
exchange rates between foreign currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
we did not hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
however  our investment policy does allow us to use derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency denominated obligations 
our cash flows are denominated in us dollars
