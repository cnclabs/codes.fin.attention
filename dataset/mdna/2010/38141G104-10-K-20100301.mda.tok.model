table of contents executive overview our diluted earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended november  return on average common shareholders equity roe was for net revenues for were billion  more than double the amount in our ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for was and represented our lowest annual ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues 
in addition  compensation was reduced by million to fund a charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives  our donor advised fund 
this contribution of million was part of total commitments to charitable and small business initiatives during the year in excess of billion 
during the twelve months ended december   book value per common share increased to and tangible book value per common share increased to 
during the year  the firm repurchased the preferred stock and associated warrant that were issued to the us department of the treasury us treasury pursuant to the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
the firm s cumulative payments to the us treasury related to this program totaled billion  including the return of the us treasury s billion investment  million in preferred dividends and billion related to the warrant repurchase 
in addition  in the firm completed a public offering of common stock for proceeds of billion 
our tier capital ratio under basel i was as of december  and our tier common ratio under basel i was as of december  net revenues in trading and principal investments were significantly higher compared with  reflecting a very strong performance in fixed income  currency and commodities ficc and significantly improved results in principal investments  as well as higher net revenues in equities 
during  ficc operated in an environment characterized by strong client driven activity  particularly in more liquid products 
in addition  asset values generally improved and corporate credit spreads tightened significantly for most of the year 
net revenues in ficc were significantly higher compared with  reflecting particularly strong performances in credit products  mortgages and interest rate products  which were each significantly higher than net revenues in commodities were also particularly strong and were slightly higher than  while net revenues in currencies were strong  but lower than a particularly strong during  mortgages included a loss of approximately billion excluding hedges on commercial mortgage loans 
results in were negatively impacted by asset writedowns across non investment grade credit origination activities  corporate debt  private and public equities  and residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities 
the increase in principal investments reflected gains on corporate principal investments and our investment in the ordinary shares of industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc compared with net losses in in  results in principal investments included a gain of billion related to our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc  a gain of billion from corporate principal investments and a loss of billion from real estate principal investments 
net revenues in equities for reflected strong results in the client franchise businesses 
however  roe is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders equity 
see results of operations financial overview below for further information regarding our calculation of roe 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units rsus granted to employees with no future service requirements 
we believe that tangible common shareholders equity is meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy 
see equity capital capital ratios and metrics below for further information regarding tangible common shareholders equity 
as a bank holding company  we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board 
we are reporting our tier capital ratios calculated in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies  which are based on the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i 
the tier capital ratio equals tier capital divided by total risk weighted assets rwas 
the tier common ratio equals tier capital less preferred stock and junior subordinated debt issued to trusts  divided by rwas 
see equity capital consolidated capital requirements below for further information regarding our capital ratios 

table of contents results in the client franchise businesses were lower than a strong and included significantly lower commissions 
results in principal strategies were positive compared with losses in during  equities operated in an environment characterized by a significant increase in global equity prices  favorable market opportunities and a significant decline in volatility levels 
net revenues in asset management and securities services decreased significantly compared with  reflecting significantly lower net revenues in securities services  as well as lower net revenues in asset management 
the decrease in securities services primarily reflected the impact of lower customer balances  reflecting lower hedge fund industry assets and reduced leverage 
the decrease in asset management primarily reflected the impact of changes in the composition of assets managed  principally due to equity market depreciation during the fourth quarter of  as well as lower incentive fees 
during the year ended december   assets under management increased billion to billion  due to billion of market appreciation  primarily in fixed income and equity assets  partially offset by billion of net outflows 
outflows in money market assets were offset by inflows in fixed income assets 
net revenues in investment banking decreased compared with  reflecting significantly lower net revenues in financial advisory  partially offset by higher net revenues in our underwriting business 
the decrease in financial advisory reflected a decline in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions 
the increase in underwriting reflected higher net revenues in equity underwriting  primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide equity and equity related offerings 
net revenues in debt underwriting were slightly lower than in our investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly during the twelve months ended december  our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets  economic conditions generally and other factors 
for a further discussion of the factors that may affect our future operating results  see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses below as well as risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k 
our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not 

table of contents business environment our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate 
during  the economies of the us  europe and japan experienced a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions was greatly reduced  reflecting a reduction in consumer spending and low levels of liquidity across credit markets 
in addition  unemployment continued to rise in however  economic conditions became generally more favorable during the second half of the year as real gross domestic product gdp growth turned positive in most major economies and growth in emerging markets improved 
in addition  equity and credit markets were characterized by increasing asset prices  lower volatility and improved liquidity during the last nine months of the year

table of contents certain risk factors that may affect our businesses we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  liquidity  credit  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management below 
a summary of the more important factors that could affect our businesses follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our businesses  see risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  high global gdp growth  transparent  liquid and efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  stable geopolitical conditions  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation  interest rates  exchange rate volatility  default rates or the price of basic commodities  outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability  corporate  political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets  natural disasters or pandemics  or a combination of these or other factors 
our businesses and profitability have been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions in many ways  including the following many of our businesses  such as our merchant banking businesses  our mortgages  leveraged loan and credit products businesses in our ficc segment  and our equity principal strategies business  have net long positions in debt securities  loans  derivatives  mortgages  equities including private equity and most other asset classes 
in addition  many of our market making and other businesses in which we act as a principal to facilitate our clients activities  including our exchange based market making businesses  commit large amounts of capital to maintain trading positions in interest rate and credit products  as well as currencies  commodities and equities 
because nearly all of these investing and trading positions are marked to market on a daily basis  declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings  unless we have effectively hedged our exposures to such declines 
in certain circumstances particularly in the case of leveraged loans and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets  it may not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets 
sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets  which may make it very difficult to sell  hedge or value such assets 
the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may require us to maintain additional capital and increase our funding costs 
our cost of obtaining long term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads 
credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness 
widening credit spreads  as well as significant declines in the availability of credit  have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future 
we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long term debt  promissory notes and commercial paper  by accepting deposits at our bank subsidiaries or by obtaining bank loans or lines of credit 
we seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis  including by entering into repurchase agreements 
any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses 
if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding  both of which could reduce our profitability  particularly in our businesses that involve investing  lending and taking principal positions  including market making 

table of contents our investment banking business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 
poor economic conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and ceo confidence  resulting in significant industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory transactions  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins 
in addition  our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions 
a lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size  volume and timing of our clients merger and acquisition transactions particularly large transactions 
because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions  a decline in the number of large transactions would adversely affect our investment banking business 
certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
on the other hand  increased volatility  while it can increase trading volumes and spreads  also increases risk as measured by var and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market making and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of these businesses in order to avoid increasing our var 
limiting the size of our market making positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our profitability 
we receive asset based management fees based on the value of our clients portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and  in some cases  we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments 
declines in asset values reduce the value of our clients portfolios or fund assets  which in turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets 
market uncertainty  volatility and adverse economic conditions  as well as declines in asset values  may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts or affect our ability to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients and result in reduced net revenues  principally in our asset management business 
to the extent that clients do not withdraw their funds  they may invest them in products that generate less fee income 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading  investing  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our market making  trading  investing and lending businesses 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments  or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us  or even by the perception among market participants that we  or other market participants  are experiencing greater liquidity risk 
the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are complex  as we employ structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves  and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress 
our investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets  which could restrict liquidity for our positions 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time  as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis 
in addition  financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set off rights or the right to require additional collateral  including in difficult market conditions  which could further impair our access to liquidity 

table of contents our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under these provisions  counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings  see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below 
group inc has guaranteed the payment obligations of goldman  sachs co 
gs co  goldman sachs bank usa gs bank usa and goldman sachs bank europe plc gs bank europe  subject to certain exceptions  and has pledged significant assets to gs bank usa to support obligations to gs bank usa 
in addition  group inc guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction by transaction basis  as negotiated with counterparties 
these guarantees may require group inc to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when group inc is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations 
credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
a failure of a significant market participant  or even concerns about a default by such an institution  could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results 
while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty  disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets 
default rates  downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress and illiquidity 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee  particularly as new business initiatives and market developments lead us to transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties  as well as clearing houses and exchanges  and expose us to new asset classes and new markets 
we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients seek such commitments from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
operational risk 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor  on a daily basis  a very large number of transactions  many of which are highly complex  across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
these transactions  as well as the information technology services we provide to clients  often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  internet  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 

table of contents industry consolidation  whether among market participants or financial intermediaries  increases the risk of operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be integrated  often on an accelerated basis 
furthermore  the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents  exchanges and clearing houses  and the increased centrality of these entities under proposed and potential regulation  increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business 
legal  regulatory and reputational risk 
we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world 
several of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements and  as a bank holding company  we are subject to minimum capital standards and a minimum tier leverage ratio on a consolidated basis 
our status as a bank holding company and the operation of our lending and other businesses through gs bank usa subject us to additional regulation and limitations on our activities  as described in regulation banking regulation in part i  item of our annual report on form k 
new regulations could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions  or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions  or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices  restructuring our businesses  moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements  including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors 
to the extent new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions  this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way 
a financial crisis responsibility fee to be assessed on the largest financial firms by the us government was proposed on january  however  since this is still in the proposal stage and has not been approved by congress  details surrounding the fee have not been finalized 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the proposal on our results of operations 
the impact of the proposal  if any  will be recorded when it is ultimately enacted 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us  or adverse publicity  governmental scrutiny or legal and enforcement proceedings regardless of the ultimate outcome  could have material adverse financial effects  cause significant reputational harm to us or adversely impact the morale and performance of our employees  which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and results of operations 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high 
our experience has been that legal claims by customers and clients increase in a market downturn and that employment related claims increase in periods when we have reduced the total number of employees 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates below 

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instruments  with related gains or losses generally recognized in trading and principal investments in our consolidated statements of earnings  is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date ie  the exit price 
financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices 
fair value measurements do not include transaction costs 
substantially all trading assets and trading liabilities are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
in determining fair value  we separate our trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value into two categories cash instruments and derivative contracts  as set forth in the following table trading instruments by category in millions as of december as of november trading trading trading trading assets  at liabilities  at assets  at liabilities  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments icbc smfg other principal investments principal investments cash instruments exchange traded over the counter derivative contracts total includes interests of billion and billion as of december and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
the fair value of our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc  which trade on the stock exchange of hong kong  includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation for which we maintain an economic currency hedge 
the following table sets forth the principal investments other than our investments in icbc and sumitomo mitsui financial group  inc smfg included within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment as of december as of november corporate real estate total corporate real estate total in millions private public total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of december and november  respectively 
represents an economic hedge on the shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
net of cash paid pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of december and november  respectively 

table of contents cash instruments 
cash instruments include cash trading instruments  public principal investments and private principal investments 
cash trading instruments 
our cash trading instruments eg  equity and debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most government obligations  active listed equities and certain money market securities 
the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active  but are valued based on quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include most government agency securities  most corporate bonds  certain mortgage products  certain bank loans and bridge loans  less liquid listed equities  certain state  municipal and provincial obligations and certain money market securities and loan commitments 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency 
such instruments include private equity investments and real estate fund investments  certain bank loans and bridge loans including certain mezzanine financing  leveraged loans arising from capital market transactions and other corporate bank debt  less liquid corporate debt securities and other debt obligations including less liquid corporate bonds  distressed debt instruments and collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by corporate obligations  less liquid mortgage whole loans and securities backed by either commercial or residential real estate  and acquired portfolios of distressed loans 
the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
this valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability 
such adjustments are generally based on market evidence where available 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
public principal investments 
our public principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment tend to be large  concentrated holdings resulting from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  and are valued based on quoted market prices 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability 
such adjustments are generally based on market evidence where available 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc is valued using the quoted market price adjusted for transfer restrictions 
under the original transfer restrictions  the icbc shares we held would have become free from transfer restrictions in equal installments on april  and october  during the quarter ended march  the shares became subject to new supplemental transfer restrictions 
under these new supplemental transfer restrictions  on april   of the icbc shares that we held became free from transfer restrictions and we completed the disposition of these shares during the second quarter of our remaining icbc shares are subject to transfer restrictions  which prohibit liquidation at any time prior to april  
table of contents we also have an investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
this investment is valued using a model that is principally based on smfg s common stock price 
during  we converted one third of our smfg preferred stock investment into smfg common stock  and delivered the common stock to close out one third of our hedge position 
as of december  we remained hedged on substantially all of the common stock underlying our remaining investment in smfg 
private principal investments 
our private principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment include investments in private equity  debt and real estate  primarily held through investment funds 
by their nature  these investments have little or no price transparency 
we value such instruments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments 
such evidence includes recent third party investments or pending transactions  third party independent appraisals  transactions in similar instruments  discounted cash flow techniques  valuation multiples and public comparables 
derivative contracts 
derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter otc 
we generally value exchange traded derivatives using models which calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing price of the exchange traded derivatives and their underlying instruments 
otc derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument  as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates  loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information  and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult 
where we do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions  the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
subsequent to initial recognition  we only update valuation inputs when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions  third party pricing services and or broker or dealer quotations  or other empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model value to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 
see derivatives below for further information on our otc derivatives 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads and credit considerations 
such adjustments are generally based on market evidence where available 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 

table of contents controls over valuation of financial instruments 
a control infrastructure  independent of the trading and investing functions  is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market clearing levels ie  exit prices and that fair value measurements are reliable and consistently determined 
we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed appropriately 
we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the trading and investing functions 
for financial instruments where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable  we employ  where possible  procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions  analysis of actual to projected cash flows  comparisons with subsequent sales  reviews of valuations used for collateral management purposes and discussions with senior business leaders 
see market risk and credit risk below for a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses 
fair value hierarchy level the fair value hierarchy under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date ie  the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
instruments that trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
we determine which instruments are classified within level based on the results of our price verification process 
this process is performed by personnel independent of our trading and investing functions who corroborate valuations to external market data eg  quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  third party pricing vendors  recent trading activity and comparative analyses to similar instruments 
instruments with valuations which cannot be corroborated to external market data are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
when broker or dealer quotations or third party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification  greater priority is given to executable quotes 
as part of our price verification process  valuations based on quotes are corroborated by comparison both to other quotes and to recent trading activity in the same or similar instruments 
the number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding fair value measurements 
valuation methodologies for level assets 
instruments classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price  which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value 
as time passes  transaction price becomes less reliable as an estimate of fair value and accordingly  we use other methodologies to determine fair value  which vary based on the type of instrument  as described below 
regardless of the methodology  valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence 
senior management in control functions  independent of the trading and investing functions  reviews all significant unrealized gains losses  including the primary drivers of the change in value 
valuations are further corroborated 
table of contents by values realized upon sales of our level assets 
an overview of methodologies used to value our level assets subsequent to the transaction date is as follows equities and convertible debentures 
substantially all of our level equities and convertible debentures consist of private equity investments and real estate fund investments 
for private equity investments  recent third party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value 
in the absence of such evidence  valuations are based on one or more of the following methodologies  as appropriate and available transactions in similar instruments  discounted cash flow techniques  third party independent appraisals  valuation multiples and public comparables 
such evidence includes pending reorganizations eg  merger proposals  tender offers or debt restructurings  and significant changes in financial metrics eg  operating results as compared to previous projections  industry multiples  credit ratings and balance sheet ratios 
real estate fund investments are carried at net asset value per share 
the underlying investments in the funds are generally valued using discounted cash flow techniques  for which the key inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  capitalization rates and valuation multiples 
bank loans and bridge loans and corporate debt securities and other debt obligations 
valuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques  for which the key inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  market yields for such instruments and recovery assumptions 
inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses  which incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotes are available 
loans and securities backed by commercial real estate 
loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are collateralized by specific assets and may be tranched into varying levels of subordination 
due to the nature of these instruments  valuation techniques vary by instrument 
methodologies include relative value analyses across different tranches  comparisons to transactions in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or substantially the same underlying collateral  market indices such as the cmbx  and credit default swaps  as well as discounted cash flow techniques 
loans and securities backed by residential real estate 
valuations are based on both proprietary and industry recognized models including intex and bloomberg  and discounted cash flow techniques 
in the recent market environment  the most significant inputs to the valuation of these instruments are rates and timing of delinquency  default and loss expectations  which are driven in part by housing prices 
inputs are determined based on relative value analyses  which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles  including relevant indices such as the abx 
loan portfolios 
valuations are based on discounted cash flow techniques  for which the key inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and market yields for such instruments 
inputs are determined based on relative value analyses which incorporate comparisons to recent auction data for other similar loan portfolios 
derivative contracts 
valuation models are calibrated to initial transaction price 
subsequent changes in valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation models eg  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities  etc inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data 
valuations of less liquid otc derivatives are typically based on level or level inputs that can be observed in the market  as well as unobservable inputs  such as correlations and volatilities 
the cmbx and abx are indices that track the performance of commercial mortgage bonds and subprime residential mortgage bonds  respectively

other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
in addition to trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value  we have elected to account for certain of our other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under asc and asc ie  the fair value option 
the primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis  to mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes and to address simplification and cost benefit considerations 
such financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value include certain unsecured short term borrowings  consisting of all promissory notes and commercial paper and certain hybrid financial instruments  certain other secured financings  primarily transfers accounted for as financings rather than sales  debt raised through our william street credit extension program and certain other nonrecourse financings  certain unsecured long term borrowings  including prepaid physical commodity transactions and certain hybrid financial instruments  resale and repurchase agreements  securities borrowed and loaned within trading and principal investments  consisting of our matched book and certain firm financing activities  certain deposits issued by our bank subsidiaries  as well as securities held by gs bank usa  certain receivables from customers and counterparties  including certain margin loans  transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases and prepaid variable share forwards  certain insurance and reinsurance contracts and certain guarantees  and in general  investments acquired after november   when the fair value option became available  where we have significant influence over the investee and would otherwise apply the equity method of accounting 
in certain cases  we apply the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to our principal business activities  where we have a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee  or where cost benefit considerations are less significant 

table of contents goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally slk llc slk in  the ayco company  lp ayco in and our variable annuity and life insurance business in  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments  which are components one level below our three business segments  for impairment at least annually  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each segment observable average price to earnings multiples of our competitors in these businesses and price to book multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 
during particularly during the fourth quarter and early  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
if there was a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and financial markets  our businesses would be adversely affected  which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future

table of contents identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives or  in the case of insurance contracts  in proportion to estimated gross profits or premium revenues 
identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and range of estimated remaining lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class identifiable intangible assets by asset class in millions as of december as of november range of estimated carrying remaining lives carrying value in years value customer lists new york stock exchange nyse designated market maker dmm rights insurance related assets exchange traded fund etf lead market maker rights other total primarily includes our clearance and execution and nasdaq customer lists related to slk and financial counseling customer lists related to ayco 
primarily includes the value of business acquired related to our insurance businesses 
primarily includes marketing related assets and other contractual rights 
a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in trading volumes or market structure that could adversely affect our exchange based market making businesses see discussion below  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or iii adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business 
in october  the sec approved the nyse s proposal to create a new market model and redefine the role of nyse dmms 
in june  the nyse successfully completed the rollout of new systems architecture that further reduces order completion time  which enables the nyse to offer competitive execution speeds  while continuing to incorporate the price discovery provided by dmms 
following solid performance during the first half of  in the latter half of  our dmm business was adversely impacted primarily by the lack of timely market data in the internal order execution system of the nyse which  at times  results in dmms making markets without real time price information and to a lesser extent  by lower trading volumes and lower volatility 
in  the nyse is expected to address this market data issue 
there can be no assurance that changes in these factors will result in sufficient cash flows to avoid impairment of our nyse dmm rights in the future 
in accordance with the requirements of asc  we will be closely monitoring the performance of our dmm business to determine whether an impairment loss is required in the future 
as of december  the carrying value of our nyse dmm rights was million 
to the extent that there were to be an impairment in the future  it would result in a significant writedown in the carrying value of these dmm rights 

table of contents use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in accounting for income taxes  we estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under asc see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

we generate net revenues from returns on these investments and from the increased share of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a fund s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns typically referred to as an override 
substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily and  therefore  its value and our net revenues are subject to fluctuations based on market movements 
in addition  net revenues derived from our principal investments  including those in privately held concerns and in real estate  may fluctuate significantly depending on the revaluation of these investments in any given period 
we also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses 
the number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period

asset management provides investment and wealth advisory services and offers investment products primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles  such as mutual funds and private investment funds across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees 
securities services 
securities services provides prime brokerage services  financing services and securities lending services to institutional clients  including hedge funds  mutual funds  pension funds and foundations  and to high net worth individuals worldwide  and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees 
assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of asset value  which is affected by investment performance and by inflows and redemptions 
the fees that we charge vary by asset class  as do our related expenses 
in certain circumstances  we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets 
incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends in most cases  on december and they are no longer subject to adjustment

off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit and representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  including the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages  corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
we engage in transactions with variable interest entities vies  including vies that were considered qualifying special purpose entities qspes prior to our adoption of accounting standards update  transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets  in the first quarter of asset backed financing vehicles are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting 
we did not have off balance sheet commitments to purchase or finance any cdos held by structured investment vehicles as of december or november 
table of contents in december  the american securitization forum asf issued the streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans asf framework 
the asf framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention measures for securitized subprime residential mortgages that meet certain criteria 
for certain eligible loans as defined in the asf framework  servicers may presume default is reasonably foreseeable and apply a fast track loan modification plan  under which the loan interest rate will be kept at the then current rate for a period up to five years following the upcoming reset date 
mortgage loan modifications of these eligible loans did not affect our accounting treatment for qspes that hold the subprime loans

table of contents equity capital the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk based capital assessment  and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
our consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by the federal reserve board  as described below 
our internal risk based capital assessment is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities  including market risk  credit risk and operational risk  in a manner that is closely aligned with our risk management practices 
as of december  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
as of november  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
in addition to total shareholders equity  we consider our billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be part of our equity capital  as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes 
consolidated capital requirements the federal reserve board is the primary us regulator of group inc  a bank holding company that in august also became a financial holding company under the us gramm leach bliley act of as a bank holding company  we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve board 
under the federal reserve board s capital adequacy rules  goldman sachs must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices 
the firm s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 

table of contents consolidated capital ratios the following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated capital ratios as of december calculated in accordance with the federal reserve board s regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies  which are based on basel i 
these ratios are used by the federal reserve board and other us federal banking agencies in the supervisory review process  including the assessment of our capital adequacy 
the calculation of these ratios includes certain market risk measures that are under review by the federal reserve board 
the calculation of these ratios has not been reviewed with the federal reserve board and  accordingly  these ratios may be revised in subsequent filings 
as of december in millions tier capital common shareholders equity preferred stock junior subordinated debt issued to trusts less goodwill less disallowable intangible assets less other deductions tier capital tier capital qualifying subordinated debt less other deductions tier capital total capital risk weighted assets tier capital ratio total capital ratio tier leverage ratio principally includes equity investments in non financial companies and the cumulative change in the fair value of our unsecured borrowings attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads  disallowed deferred tax assets  and investments in certain nonconsolidating entities 
substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as tier capital for basel i purposes 
rwas under the federal reserve board s risk based capital guidelines are calculated based on the amount of market risk and credit risk 
rwas for market risk include certain measures that are under review by the federal reserve board 
credit risk for on balance sheet assets is based on the balance sheet value 
for off balance sheet exposures  including otc derivatives and commitments  a credit equivalent amount is calculated based on the notional of each trade 
all such assets and amounts are then assigned a risk weight depending on  among other things  whether the counterparty is a sovereign  bank or qualifying securities firm  or other entity or if collateral is held  depending on the nature of the collateral 
our tier leverage ratio is defined as tier capital under basel i divided by adjusted average total assets which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets 

table of contents federal reserve board regulations require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum tier capital ratio of and a minimum total capital ratio of 
the required minimum tier capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be considered a well capitalized bank holding company under the federal reserve board guidelines are and  respectively 
bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels  depending upon their particular condition  risk profile and growth plans 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under federal reserve board guidelines or that have implemented the federal reserve board s risk based capital measure for market risk 
other bank holding companies must have a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
during  the basel committee on banking supervision proposed several changes to the method of computing capital ratios 
in addition  there are several other proposals which could potentially impact capital requirements 
as a consequence  it is possible that minimum capital ratios required to be maintained under federal reserve board regulations could be increased 
it is also possible that changes in the prescribed calculation methodology could result in higher rwas and lower capital ratios than are currently computed 
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world 
gs bank usa  a new york state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  is regulated by the federal reserve board and the new york state banking department and is subject to minimum capital requirements that subject to certain exceptions are similar to those applicable to bank holding companies 
gs bank usa and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action pca 
gs bank usa computes its capital ratios in accordance with the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to state member banks  which are based on basel i as implemented by the federal reserve board  for purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital

subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines  rating agency requirements for entities with assigned credit ratings or internal policies  including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk 
in certain instances  group inc may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory  tax or other constraints 
as of december  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion compared with its total shareholders equity of billion 

table of contents group inc has guaranteed the payment obligations of gs co  gs bank usa and gs bank europe  subject to certain exceptions 
in november  we contributed subsidiaries into gs bank usa  and group inc agreed to guarantee certain losses  including credit related losses  relating to assets held by the contributed entities 
in connection with this guarantee  group inc also agreed to pledge to gs bank usa certain collateral  including interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivative contracts and non us denominated debt 
rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc  which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of the firm s senior unsecured obligations 
gs bank usa has also been assigned a long term issuer rating as well as ratings on its long term and short term bank deposits 
in addition  credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below for further information regarding our credit ratings 
equity capital management our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal composition of equity capital 
we principally manage our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock 
we may also  from time to time  issue or repurchase our preferred stock  junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt as business conditions warrant 
we manage our capital requirements principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and or limits on risk  in each case at both the consolidated and business unit levels 
we attribute capital usage to each of our business units based upon our internal risk based capital framework and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established 
stock offering 
during the second quarter of  we completed a public offering of million common shares at per share for total proceeds of billion 
preferred stock 
in june  we repurchased from the us treasury the million shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series h series h preferred stock  that were issued to the us treasury pursuant to the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
the repurchase resulted in a one time preferred dividend of million  which is included in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december this one time preferred dividend represented the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the series h preferred stock 
in connection with the issuance of the series h preferred stock in october  we issued a year warrant to the us treasury to purchase up to million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we repurchased this warrant in full in july for billion  which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
our cumulative payments to the us treasury related to the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program totaled billion  including the return of the us treasury s billion investment inclusive of the million described above  million in preferred dividends and billion related to the warrant repurchase 

table of contents in october  we issued to berkshire hathaway and certain affiliates  shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series g series g preferred stock  and a five year warrant to purchase up to million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of billion 
the allocated carrying values of the warrant and the series g preferred stock based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance were billion and billion  respectively 
the series g preferred stock is redeemable at the firm s option  subject to the approval of the federal reserve board  at a redemption value of billion  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
accordingly  upon a redemption in full at any time in the future of the series g preferred stock  we would recognize a one time preferred dividend of billion calculated as the difference between the carrying value and redemption value of the preferred stock  which would be recorded as a reduction to our earnings applicable to common shareholders and to our common shareholders equity in the period of redemption 
share repurchase program 
we seek to use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation 
the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open market purchases  the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital positions ie  comparisons of our desired level of capital to our actual level of capital but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock 
any repurchase of our common stock requires approval by the federal reserve board 
as of december  we were authorized to repurchase up to million additional shares of common stock pursuant to our repurchase program  subject to the approval of the federal reserve board

we consider junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to certain characteristics of the debt  including its long term nature  our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure 

table of contents the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity capital as of december november in millions total shareholders equity add junior subordinated debt issued to trusts   deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets   tangible equity capital the leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
this ratio is different from the tier leverage ratio included above  which is described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k 
the adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses 
the debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including rsus granted to employees with no future service requirements

risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational exposures 
risk management structure we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational  compliance and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process  as described further below 
these committees including their subcommittees  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 
segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described below  functions that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
management committee 
the management committee oversees the global activities of the firm  including all firm risk control functions 
the committee provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to the committees it has established 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee is globally responsible for the ongoing monitoring and control of financial risks associated with the activities of the firm 
through both direct and delegated authority  the committee approves firmwide  product  divisional and business unit limits for both market and credit risks  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings groups  and reviews stress test and scenario analyses results 
the committee also approves new businesses and products 

table of contents the securities division risk committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities  subject to overall firmwide risk limits  for the ficc and equities businesses based on a number of risk measures  including var  stress tests  scenario analyses  and inventory levels 
business unit risk limits are established by the appropriate risk committee and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored by the finance division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed  as necessary 
credit risk limits are also monitored by the finance division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee 
the investment management division risk committee oversees market  counterparty credit and liquidity risks related to our asset management businesses 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance and operational risks and related reputational concerns  seeks to ensure the consistency of our policies  practices and procedures with our business principles  and makes recommendations on ways to mitigate potential risks 
firmwide capital committee 
the firmwide capital committee provides approval and oversight of debt related transactions  including principal commitments of the firm s capital 
such capital commitments include  but are not limited to  extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments and certain debt underwritings 
the firmwide capital committee aims to ensure that business and reputational standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities  primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities  and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities 
in addition to reviewing specific transactions  the commitments committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices

finance committee 
the finance committee has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk  the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base  and our credit ratings 
the finance committee regularly reviews our liquidity  balance sheet  funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events  risks and exposures  and regulatory requirements 
new products committee 
the new products committee  under the oversight of the firmwide risk committee  is responsible for reviewing and approving new product proposals 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves proposed structured product transactions to be entered into with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 

table of contents market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  proprietary trading  underwriting and investing activities 
substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues 
categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
we seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may seek to hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 
in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk for trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 
var var is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also occur more frequently or accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 

table of contents the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
the following tables set forth the daily var average daily var in millions year ended december november november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var  where var is not the most appropriate measure of risk eg  due to transfer restrictions and or illiquidity 
see other market risk measures below 
equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in  principally due to an increase in the interest rates category and a reduction in the diversification benefit across risk categories  partially offset by a decrease in the commodity prices category 
the increase in interest rates was primarily due to wider spreads 
the decrease in commodity prices was primarily due to lower energy prices 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in  principally due to increases in the interest rate  commodity price and currency rate categories  partially offset by a decrease in the equity prices category 
the increase in interest rates was primarily due to higher levels of volatility and wider spreads  partially offset by position reductions  and the increases in commodity prices and currency rates were primarily due to higher levels of volatility 
the decrease in equity prices was principally due to position reductions  partially offset by higher levels of volatility 
var excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
the estimated sensitivity of our net revenues to a one basis point increase in credit spreads counterparty and our own on derivatives was a million loss as of december in addition  the estimated sensitivity of our net revenues to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was an million gain including hedges as of december

our daily var decreased to million as of december from million as of november  due to a decrease in the interest rate and currency rate categories as well as an increase in the diversification benefit across risk categories  partially offset by an increase in the equity prices category 
the decrease in interest rates was principally due to lower market volatilities  tighter spreads and lower levels of exposure 
the decrease in currency rates was primarily due to lower market volatilities

the market risk related to our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc  excluding interests held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs  is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in the icbc ordinary share price 
the market risk related to the remaining positions is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in asset values 
the sensitivity analyses for these equity and debt positions in the ficc and equities components of our trading and principal investments segment and equity  debt primarily mezzanine instruments and real estate positions in the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset values including the impact of leverage in the underlying investments for real estate positions in the principal investments component of such positions 
the fair value of the underlying positions may be impacted by recent third party investments or pending transactions  third party independent appraisals  transactions in similar instruments  valuation multiples and public comparables  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows

such funds typically employ leverage as part of the investment strategy 
this sensitivity measure is based on our percentage ownership of the underlying asset values in the funds and unfunded commitments to the funds 
the decrease in our sensitivity measures as of december from november for debt and equity positions in the ficc and equities components of our trading and principal investments segment was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of the portfolios as well as due to dispositions 
the decrease in our sensitivity measure for equity positions in our principal investments component was primarily due to dispositions 
the increase in our sensitivity measure for debt positions in our principal investments component was primarily due to new investment activity 
the decrease in our sensitivity measure for real estate positions in our principal investments component was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio 
in addition to the positions included in var and the other risk measures described above  as of december  we held approximately billion of financial instruments in our bank and insurance subsidiaries  primarily consisting of billion of money market instruments  billion of government and us federal agency obligations  billion of corporate debt securities and other debt obligations  and billion of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities 
as of november  we held approximately billion of financial instruments in our bank and insurance subsidiaries  primarily consisting of billion of money market instruments  billion of government and us federal agency obligations  billion of corporate debt securities and other debt obligations  and billion of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities 
in addition  as of december and november  we held commitments and loans under the william street credit extension program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding our william street credit extension program 

table of contents credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us  or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or other instruments  including otc derivatives  we hold 
our exposure to credit risk principally arises through our trading  investing and financing activities 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by i entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis  ii seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and or iii transferring our credit risk to third parties using credit derivatives and or other structures and techniques 
to measure and manage our credit exposures  we use a variety of tools  including credit limits referenced to current exposure and potential exposure 
potential exposure is an estimate of exposure  within a specified confidence level  that could be outstanding over the life of a transaction based on market movements 
in addition  as part of our market risk management process  for positions measured by changes in credit spreads  we use var and other sensitivity measures 
to supplement our primary credit exposure measures  we also use scenario analyses  such as credit spread widening scenarios  stress tests and other quantitative tools 
our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries 
these systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties  we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  clearing houses  exchanges and investment funds 
this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry 
in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty  borrower or issuer  including sovereign issuers  or to a particular clearing house or exchange 
as of december and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of us government and federal agency obligations included in trading assets  at fair value and cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
as of december and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of other sovereign obligations  principally consisting of securities issued by the governments of the united kingdom and japan 
in addition  as of december and november  billion and billion of our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed including those in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes  respectively  were collateralized by us government and federal agency obligations 
as of december and november  billion and billion of our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed  respectively  were collateralized by other sovereign obligations  principally consisting of securities issued by the governments of germany  the united kingdom and japan 
as of december and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 

table of contents derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  that derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into to facilitate client transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and is reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when we believe a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 
the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by tenor and by product type or credit rating 
tenor is based on expected duration for mortgage related credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual maturity for other derivatives 
for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument  the tenor is generally classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument 
in those instances where the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash  the tenor is generally based upon the option expiration date

receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same tenor category are netted within such tenor category  where appropriate 
the decrease in the fair value of our otc derivative credit exposure from november to december primarily reflects increases in equity prices  tightening credit spreads  and changes in interest and currency rates 
derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
in addition  certain derivative transactions eg  credit derivative contracts involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining  or be unable to obtain  the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement 

table of contents liquidity and funding risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both goldman sachs specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenues  even under adverse circumstances 
we manage liquidity risk according to the following framework excess liquidity we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment  including financing obligations 
the amount of our excess liquidity is based on an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
asset liability management our funding strategy includes an assessment of the overall characteristics of our assets with respect to their anticipated holding periods and potential illiquidity in a stressed environment 
in addition  we manage the maturities and diversity of our secured and unsecured funding liabilities across markets  products and counterparties  and we seek to maintain liabilities of appropriate term relative to our asset base 
contingency funding plan cfp we maintain a cfp to help identify  measure  monitor and mitigate liquidity and funding risk 
the cfp considers various risk factors that could occur during a crisis and provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our potential cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
our businesses are diverse  and our cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our total assets  and our funding costs 

table of contents the size of our global core excess is based on an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity model  through which we analyze the consolidated firm as well as our major broker dealer and bank depository institution subsidiaries  identifies and estimates potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured long term debt  promissory notes  commercial paper  term deposits and other unsecured funding products  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding unsecured funding  potential withdrawals of client deposits in our banking entities  adverse changes in the terms of  or the inability to refinance  secured funding trades with upcoming maturities  reflecting  among other factors  the quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty concentration  outflows of cash or collateral associated with the impact of market moves on our otc derivatives  listed derivatives and securities and loans pledged as collateral for financing transactions  other outflows of cash or collateral related to derivatives  including the impact of trade terminations  collateral substitutions  collateral disputes  collateral calls or termination payments in the event of a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings  collateral that has not been called by counterparties but is available to them  or additional margin that could be requested by exchanges or clearing houses in a stressed environment  potential liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  including those related to customer credit balances  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  with draw assumptions varying in magnitude reflecting  among other things  the type of commitment and counterparty  and other upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
the following table sets forth the average loan value of the securities the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities  as well as certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our global core excess year ended december november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered us government securities  us agency securities and highly liquid us agency mortgage backed securities  all of which are eligible as collateral in federal reserve open market operations  as well as certain overnight cash deposits 
our non us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because we believe they are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
we do not believe that other potential sources of excess liquidity  such as lower quality unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities  are as reliable in a liquidity crisis 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets of billion held separately by william street funding corporation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding the william street credit extension program 

table of contents we maintain our global core excess to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the global core excess is held at group inc and our major broker dealer and bank depository institution subsidiaries 
each of these entities has its own liquidity model and funding risk management framework with separate excess liquidity pools intended to meet potential outflows in each entity in a stressed environment 
liquidity held in each of these subsidiaries is assumed to be usable only by that entity for the purpose of meeting its liquidity requirements 
subsidiary liquidity is not available to group inc unless legally provided for and assuming no additional regulatory  tax or other restrictions 
in addition to our global core excess  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
in reporting our global core excess and other unencumbered assets  we use loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset class by asset class 
the estimated aggregate loan value of our global core excess  cash deposits not included in the global core excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged billion and billion for the years ended december and november  respectively 
asset liability management assets 
we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
we impose balance sheet limits for each business and utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
although our balance sheet fluctuates due to client activity  market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses  our total assets and adjusted assets at financial statement dates are typically not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods 
liabilities 
we seek to structure our liabilities to meet the following objectives term structure we seek to structure our liabilities to have long dated maturities in order to reduce refinancing risk 
we manage maturity concentrations for both secured and unsecured funding to ensure we are able to mitigate any concentrated funding outflows 
diversity of funding sources we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we make use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets  as well as other secured funding markets 
we issue long term debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other debt offerings 
we issue short term debt through us and non us commercial paper and promissory note issuances and other methods 
we raise demand and savings deposits through cash sweep programs and time deposits through internal and third party broker networks 
we generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base 
we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies  mutual funds and individuals 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the americas  europe and asia 
we have imposed various internal guidelines on creditor concentration  including the amount of our commercial paper and promissory notes that can be owned by any single creditor or group of creditors 
structural protection we structure our liabilities to reduce the risk that we may be required to redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity 
we issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without put provisions or other provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  change in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 

table of contents secured funding 
we fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured basis  which we believe provides us with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing  as it is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality due to the underlying collateral 
however  we recognize that the terms or availability of secured funding  particularly overnight funding  can deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment 
to help mitigate this risk  we generally do not rely on overnight secured funding  unless collateralized with highly liquid securities such as securities eligible for inclusion in our global core excess 
substantially all of our other secured funding is executed for tenors of one month or greater 
additionally  we monitor counterparty concentration and hold a portion of our global core excess for refinancing risk associated with all secured funding transactions 
we seek longer terms for secured funding collateralized by lower quality assets  as we believe these funding transactions may pose greater refinancing risk 
the weighted average life of our secured funding  excluding funding collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for inclusion in our global core excess  exceeded days as of december unsecured short term borrowings 
our liquidity also depends on the stability of our unsecured short term financing base 
accordingly  we prefer issuing promissory notes  in which we do not make a market  over commercial paper  which we may repurchase prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as of december  our unsecured short term borrowings  including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings  were billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding our unsecured short term borrowings 
unsecured long term borrowings 
we issue unsecured long term borrowings as a source of total capital in order to meet our long term financing requirements 
the following table sets forth our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through as of december unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile in millions 
table of contents the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of december was approximately seven years 
to mitigate refinancing risk  we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into short term floating rate obligations in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates 
deposits 
as of december  our bank depository institution subsidiaries had billion in customer deposits  including billion of certificates of deposit and other time deposits with a weighted average maturity of four years  and billion of other deposits  substantially all of which were from cash sweep programs 
gs bank usa has access to funding through the federal reserve bank discount window 
while we do not rely on funding through the federal reserve bank discount window in our liquidity modeling and stress testing  we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding 
government facilities 
as a bank holding company  we have access to certain programs and facilities established on a temporary basis by a number of us regulatory agencies 
as of december  we had outstanding billion of senior unsecured debt comprised of billion of short term and billion of long term guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  all of which will mature on or prior to june  we have not issued long term debt under the tlgp since march and the program expired for new issuances with respect to the firm on october  see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses above  and risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k for a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access the capital markets 
funding policies 
we seek to manage our assets and the maturity profile of our secured and unsecured funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales other than our global core excess  our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
however  we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis 
the target amount of our total capital is based on an internal funding model which incorporates  among other things  the following long term financing requirements the portion of trading assets that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming stressed loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivative and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that are in excess of their long term financing requirements 

table of contents certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress 
accordingly  we focus on funding these assets with longer contractual maturities to reduce refinancing risk in periods of market stress and generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the following table sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of december november in millions mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities bank loans and bridge loans emerging market debt securities high yield and other debt obligations private equity investments and real estate fund investments emerging market equity securities icbc ordinary shares smfg convertible preferred stock other restricted public equity securities other investments in funds includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary trading activities 
includes interests in our merchant banking funds 
such amounts exclude assets related to consolidated investment funds of million and billion as of december and november  respectively  for which goldman sachs does not bear economic exposure 
includes interests of billion and billion as of december and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
includes interests in other investment funds that we manage 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold 
subsidiary funding policies 
the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc group inc 
then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing  liquidity and capital requirements 
in addition  group inc provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products  including secured funding  unsecured borrowings and deposits 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc or other subsidiaries until the maturity of such financing 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries 
for example  as of december  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in gsi  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd  a regulated japanese broker dealer  and 
table of contents billion invested in gs bank usa  a regulated new york state chartered bank 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans and billion of collateral provided to these entities as of december  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
contingency funding plan the goldman sachs cfp sets out the plan of action to fund business activity in emergency situations and or periods of market stress 
the cfp outlines the appropriate communication channels to be followed throughout a crisis period and also provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis including  but not limited to  the potential risk factors  identification of liquidity outflows  mitigants and potential actions 
credit ratings we rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions  including otc derivatives 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance and the external operating environment  including the perceived level of government support 
see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses above  and risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings 
the following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings excluding debt guaranteed by the fdic under the tlgp and outlook as of december preferred stock in the table below includes group inc s non cumulative preferred stock and the normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities apex issued by goldman sachs capital ii and goldman sachs capital iii 
as of december  the trust preferred securities trust preferred issued by goldman sachs capital i were rated a by dbrs  inc  a by fitch  inc  a by moody s investors service  and bbb by standard poor s ratings services

applies to long term and short term ratings 
applies to long term issuer default ratings 
applies to long term ratings 
applies to issuer rating 

table of contents on february   moody s investors service lowered the ratings on group inc s non cumulative preferred stock and the apex from a to baa  and the rating on the trust preferred from a to a based on our credit ratings as of december  additional collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately billion and billion could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one notch and two notch reduction  respectively  in our long term credit ratings 
in evaluating our liquidity requirements  we consider additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two notch reduction in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses 
year ended december our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we generated billion in net cash from operating activities 
we used net cash of billion for investing and financing activities  primarily for net repayments in unsecured and secured short term borrowings and the repurchases of series h preferred stock and the related common stock warrant from the us treasury  partially offset by an increase in bank deposits and the issuance of common stock 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing and operating activities  primarily from common and preferred stock issuances and deposits  partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings 
we used net cash of billion in our investing activities 
operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  or from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents related to  for example  major systems failures 
operational risk may also cause reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards which are supported by the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across goldman sachs  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis 
together  these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize operational risk exposure 
operational risk management analysis  a risk management function independent of our revenue producing units  is responsible for developing and implementing a formalized framework to identify  measure  monitor  and report operational risks to support active risk management across goldman sachs 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance  incorporates analysis of internal and external operational risk events  business environment and internal control factors  and scenario analysis 
the framework also provides regular reporting of our operational risk exposures to our board  risk committees and senior management
