risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of in addition  on april   the company acquired lifecore which develops and manufactures products utilizing hyaluronan  a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellar matrix of connective tissues in both animals and humans 
with the acquisition of lifecore  landec has four core businesses food products technology  commodity trading  hyaluronan based biomaterials and technology licensing 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the commodity trading business is operated through apio and combines apio s cal ex export company with apio s domestic buy sell commodity business that purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to asia and domestically 
the hyaluronan based biomaterials business sells products utilizing hyaluronan in the ophthalmic  orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies hyaluronan to customers pursuing other medical applications  such as aesthetic surgery  medical device coatings  tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals 
the technology licensing business includes our proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology in which certain fields of application have been licensed to monsanto and our intelimer polymer business that licenses and or supplies products to companies such as air products and nitta 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation and nature of impairments of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends  can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially low risk national and international companies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be usable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses 
the company takes title to all produce it trades and or packages  and therefore  records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the consolidated statements of income 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangibles the company s intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve years and trademarks trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives collectively  intangible assets  which the company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance i upon the acquisition of lifecore in april  our hyaluronan based biomaterials reporting unit  ii upon the acquisition of apio in december  which consists of our food products technology and commodity trading reporting units and iii from the repurchase of all noncontrolling interests in the common stock of landec ag in december accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition 
all intangible assets  including goodwill  associated with the acquisitions of lifecore and apio were allocated to the hyaluronan based biomaterials and food products technology reporting unit  respectively  pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit 
the consideration paid for the commodity trading reporting unit approximated its fair market value at the time of acquisition  and therefore no intangible assets were recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of this reporting unit 
goodwill associated with the technology licensing reporting unit consists entirely of goodwill resulting from the repurchase of the landec ag non controlling interests 
the company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually  in accordance with accounting guidance 
when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  accounting guidance requires the company to compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  accounting guidance requires the company to first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus application of the second step of the two step approach under accounting guidance is not required 
application of the intangible assets impairment tests requires significant judgment by management  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of intangible assets to reporting units  and the determination of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset and reporting unit based upon projections of future net cash flows  discount rates and market multiples  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the company s impairment review requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from the disposal of the assets 
the company conducts quarterly reviews of idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment indicators 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the impairment is viewed as other than temporary 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the asset s book value and its estimated fair value 
depending on the asset  estimated fair value may be determined either by use of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of assets and would increase or decrease any impairment measurement 
the company tested its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment as of july  and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of the intangible assets were necessary as of that date 
on a quarterly basis  the company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its intangible assets  based on management s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation 
such changes  if significant or material  could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the intangible assets during the current period 
the results of these tests could lead to write downs of the carrying values of the intangible assets in the current period 
the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf approach to develop an estimate of fair value 
the dcf approach recognizes that current value is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
indications of value are developed by discounting projected future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the market approach was not used to value the food products technology  hyaluronan based biomaterials and technology licensing reporting units the reporting units because insufficient market comparables exist to enable the company to develop a reasonable fair value of its intangible assets due to the unique nature of each of the company s reporting units 
the dcf approach requires the company to exercise judgment in determining future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future product sales  which are inherently difficult to predict 
these net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the dcf associated with the technology licensing reporting unit is based on the monsanto agreement with monsanto 
under the monsanto agreement  monsanto has agreed to pay landec ag a license fee of million in cash per year for five years beginning in december  and a fee of million if monsanto elects to terminate the monsanto agreement  or million if monsanto elects to purchase the rights to the exclusive field 
if the purchase option is exercised before december  or if monsanto elects to terminate the monsanto agreement  all annual license fees that have not been paid to landec ag will become due upon the purchase or termination 
as of may   the fair value of the technology licensing reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  exceeded its book value  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
the discount rate utilized approximates the risk free interest rate as the cash flow stream is guaranteed under the terms of the monsanto agreement 
a increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the excess of fair value over book value 
the dcf associated with the food products technology reporting unit is based on management s five year projection of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of apio and the industry categories in which apio operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
as of may   the fair value of the food products technology reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  exceeded its book value  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
a increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the excess of fair value over book value 
the fair value of indefinite and finite lived intangible assets associated with our acquisition of lifecore on april   was determined using a dcf model based on management s five year projections of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of lifecore and the industry categories in which lifecore operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the trade name intangible asset was valued using the relief from royalty valuation method and the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of consideration paid  including the fair value of contingent consideration under the terms of the purchase agreement  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company updated its analysis of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill as of its annual impairment analysis date  concluding that the fair value of the hyaluronan based biomaterials reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  exceeded its book value  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
there were no impairment indicators identified by the company in its analysis of impairment associated with the acquired finite lived intangible assets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies  when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
the company adopted accounting guidance using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard to i all stock based awards issued on or after may  and ii any outstanding stock based awards that were issued but not vested as of may  the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
upon the adoption of new accounting guidance  the company changed its method of calculating and recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation arrangements to the straight line  single option method 
compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock unit awards granted prior to may  will continue to be recognized using the straight line  multiple option method 
in addition  the new accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
notes and advances receivable apio has made advances to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from crops harvested by the grower and delivered to apio 
advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from six to twelve months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value to be delivered or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines  the company may be unable to fully recoup its notes or advances receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total notes or advances receivable of  as of may  recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted pronouncements accounting standards codification effective july   the fasb accounting standards codification fasb asc is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the adoption of the fasb asc does not impact the company s consolidated financial statements  however  the company s references to accounting literature within its notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been revised to conform to the fasb asc beginning with the fiscal quarter ending november  business combinations in december  the fasb issued new guidance which significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting for business combination transactions 
the new guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of the new guidance will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets  and tax benefits 
the company adopted the new guidance on june  the company acquisition of lifecore see note was subject to the provisions of this new guidance  under which the company recognizing million of expenses related to the acquisition during the fiscal year ended may  these expenses are classified as other expenses 
non controlling interests in december  the fasb issued new guidance with respect to non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the new guidance requires the reporting of all non controlling interests as a separate component of stockholders equity  the reporting of consolidated net income loss as the amount attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interests and the separate disclosure of net income loss attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interests 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest will be accounted for as equity transactions and any retained non controlling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value 
other than the reporting requirements described above which require retrospective application  the provisions of the new guidance are to be applied prospectively 
the company adopted the new guidance on june  and such adoption did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may   however  as required  presentation of non controlling interests has been conformed to the requirements of the new guidance for all periods presented 
collaborative arrangements in december  the fasb issued new guidance concerning the accounting for collaborative arrangements which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement 
the consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties ie parties outside of the collaborative arrangement should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements based upon their role as either principal or agent 
additionally  the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative guidance  analogy to such guidance if not within their scope  or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
the company adopted the new guidance on june  and such adoption did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may  fair value disclosures in interim reports in april  the fasb issued new guidance that requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments at interim reporting periods 
the new guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  the company adopted the new guidance on june  and such adoption did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may  subsequent events in may  the fasb issued new guidance that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the company adopted the new guidance on june  and such adoption did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company determined that the basis for the date through which the entity has evaluated subsequent events represents the date the financial statements were file with the securities and exchange commission 
fair value measurements in january  the fasb new guidance whereas reporting entities will have to provide information about movements of assets among levels and  and a reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of activity valued with a level method  of the three tier fair value hierarchy established by previous accounting guidance 
the new guidance also clarifies the existing guidance to require fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  for level and disclosure requirements and after december  for level disclosure requirements 
the company adopted the guidance during fiscal and such adoption did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements other than the required disclosures 
recently issued pronouncements variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued new guidance which amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  the new guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
the company will adopt this new guidance in fiscal year and does not expect a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as a result of the new guidance 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued new guidance in relation to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
the company plans to early adopt these standards as of the beginning of fiscal for new deals originating after may  there will be no materially modified deals as a result of the adoption 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in any given period 
fair value measurements the company adopted fair value measurement accounting guidance on may  for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the company did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities 
the accounting guidance established a three tier hierarchy for fair value measurements  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which would require the company to develop its own assumptions 
as of may   the company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these included the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities for which the fair value is determined based on observable inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets 
therefore  the company has categorized its cash equivalents and marketable securities as level as of may   the company recorded to other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets an unrealized loss of  net of taxes of  as a result of the interest rate swap 
the unrealized loss was based on a level hierarchy for fair value measurements 
if the interest rate swap is terminated or the debt borrowed is paid off prior to april   the amount of unrealized loss or gain included in other comprehensive income loss would be reclassified to earnings 
the company has no intentions of terminating the interest rate swap or prepaying the debt in the next twelve months 
the interest rate swap liability is included in other non current liabilities as of may  the company has no other financial assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement has been adopted

landec is not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the continued development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms  if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months
