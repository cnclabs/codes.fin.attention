overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries and a growing pad supplier used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are deposited upon silicon wafers in the production of advanced ics 
our products play a critical role in the production of advanced ic devices  thereby enabling our customers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
demand for our cmp products is primarily driven by the number of wafers processed by semiconductor manufacturers  the first manufacturing step of which is referred to as a wafer start 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp consumables 
we develop  produce and sell cmp slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in ic devices  and also for polishing certain components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads 
in addition  we develop  manufacture and sell cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we also pursue a number of other demanding surface modification applications outside of the semiconductor and hard disk drive industries through our engineered surface finishes esf business  for which we believe our capabilities and knowledge may provide value in improved surfac e performance or productivity 
the improvement in economic and industry conditions that we began to see in our business during the second half of fiscal  following the severe global recession  continued through our fiscal and positively impacted demand for our products 
we continue to see positive signs of growth in the semiconductor industry reports from customer indicate utilization of fab capacity is currently at an all time high  inventory levels of ic devices appear to be within an appropriate range  and significant capacity expansion activity by a number of semiconductor device manufacturers is underway 
however  we remain cautious regarding future demand trends over the near term as the first quarter of the calendar year typically demonstrates softer demand due to seasonal variatio ns within the semiconductor industry 
there are many factors  that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including the pace  timing and sustainability of the ongoing economic recovery  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  quarter to quarter changes in our revenue regardless of industry strength  and potential future acquisitions by us 

index revenue for fiscal was million  which represented an increase of from the million reported for fiscal the increase in revenue from fiscal reflects increased sales volume due to improved economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
we experienced significant revenue growth across all of our product lines  including a increase in revenue from our polishing pad products and a increase in revenue from copper slurries  which benefited from a full year impact in fiscal of our february acquisition of epoch material co  ltd 
epoch versus only a partial year benefit in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents an increase from the reported for fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage from fiscal was primarily due to the significant increase in sales volume due to continued improvement in economic and industry conditions  and the related benefits of increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects 
we expect our gross profit percentage for full year fiscal to be in the range of to 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity and fl uctuations in our product mix  which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
operating expenses of million  which include research  development and technical  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  increased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our annual incentive bonus program  and the reinstatement of certain employee benefits that were suspended during the economic downturn in fiscal  higher professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property as discussed in the following paragraph  higher travel related expenses  and a full year of epoch operating expenses included in fiscal versus only a partial year in fiscal in fiscal  we expect our full year operating expenses to be in the range of million to million 
in july  a jury trial was completed in connection with our ongoing patent enforcement litigation against dupont air products nanomaterials llc da nano 
we were pleased that the validity of our patents at issue was upheld with the jury s verdict  however  we were disappointed that the jury did not find da nano s products at issue infringed the asserted claims of our patents 
in november  we filed a notice of appeal regarding infringement  and da nano filed a cross appeal 
expenses related to this trial caused our operating expenses to increase in fiscal now that the jury trial phase has been completed  we expect our litigation costs related to this matter to decrease significantly in fiscal  as they did in the fou rth quarter of fiscal see part i  item entitled legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the enforcement of our intellectual property 
diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased  or  from reported in fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by our election in fiscal to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us rather than repatriating the earnings to the us this election  which was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reduced our effective income tax rate for the year from to and increased diluted earnings per share by 
in fiscal  we expect our full year effective income tax rate to be in the range of to

index critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  valuation and classification of auction rate securities  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
the global economic recession adversely affected our ability to collect accounts receivable from some of our customers in fiscal the recession also caused a small number of our customers to file for bankruptcy or insolvency 
we recorded a million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal to account for these bankruptcies and the increased risk regarding customer collections due to the continued uncertainty in the global economy 
we will continue to monitor the financial solvency of our customers and  if global economic conditions worsen  we may have to record additional increases to our allowances for doubtful accounts 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expenses would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventories written off applied against the inventory value at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
if we had increased our reserve for obsolete inventory at september  by  our cost of goods sold wou ld have increased by million 

index valuation and classification of auction rate securities as of september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value which are classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in general  ars investments are securities with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction every seven to days 
historically  these periodic auctions provided a liquid market for these securities 
general uncertainties in the global credit markets during caused widespread ars auction failures as the number of securities submitted for sale exceeded the number of securities buyers were willing to purchase  and these auction failures have continued 
as a result  the short term li quidity of the ars market has been adversely affected since then 
as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have recorded a temporary impairment of million  net of tax  in the value of one of our ars in other comprehensive income 
the calculation of fair value and the balance sheet classification for our ars requires critical judgments and estimates by management including an appropriate discount rate and the probabilities that a security may be monetized through a future successful auction  of a refinancing of the underlying debt  of a default in payment by the issuer  and of payments not being made by the bond insurance carrier in the event of default by the issuer 
in fiscal  we adopted new accounting pronouncements regarding the classification and valuation of financial in struments 
these pronouncements discuss the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments and the determination of fair value of financial instruments when the volume of trading activity significantly drops 
an other than temporary impairment must be recorded when a credit loss exists  that is when the present value of the expected cash flows from a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
we performed two discounted cash flow analyses  one using a discount rate based on a market index comprised of tax exempt variable rate demand obligations and one using a discount rate based on the libor swap curve  and we applied a risk factor to reflect current liquidity issues in the ars market 
we then assigned probabilities of holding each security for less than or equal to one year  five years  and to maturity to calculate a fair value for each security 
we also considered the probability of default in payment by the issuer of the securities  the strength of the insurance backing and the probability of failure by the insurance carrier in the case of default by the issuer of the securities 
the impairment we have maintained is considered temporary as it relates to the loss of liquidity in the ars market and does not represent a credit loss 
we do not intend to sell the securities at a loss and we believe we will not be required to sell the securities at a loss in the future 
if auctions involving our remaining ars continue to fail  if issuers of our ars are unable to refinance the underlying securities  if the issuing municipalities are unable to pay their debt obligations and the bond insurance fails  or if credit ratings decline or other adverse developments occur in the credit markets  we may not be able to monetize our remaining securities in the near term and may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these instruments through an impairment charge that may be deemed othe r than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  an impairment pr ovision may be required 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the net book value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values require significant judgment and are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
as a result of assessments performed during fiscal  we recorded million in impairment expense 
in fiscal  we recorded million in impairment expense  primarily related to the write off of certain research and development equipment 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this write off 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 

index business combinations we have accounted for all business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
as discussed in more detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we were required to adopt new accounting standards for business combinations commencing after october  however  we have not made any acquisitions to which we were required to apply these new standards 
we have allocated the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this va luation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
contingent consideration was recorded as a liability when the outcome of the contingency became determinable 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
purchased ipr d  for which technological feasibility has not yet been established and no future alternative uses exist  has been expensed immediately 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the products when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may cause actual realized values to be different from management s e stimates 
goodwill and intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate other long lived assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discreet financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we had three reporting units to which we allocated goodwill and intangible assets as of september   the date of our annual impairment test 
initially  our company had only one reporting unit as we were created from a division of our former parent company  cabot corporation  and we identified associated goodwill and intangible assets under one reporting unit at that time 
other amounts of goodwill and intangible assets have been attributed to acquired businesses at the time of acquisition through the use of independent appraisal firms 
we have consistently determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis of our projected future results 
the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured using the royalty savings method 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  royalty rates and tax rates  among others 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis that impact these assumptions may result in future impairment charges 
as a result of the review performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets as of september  
index share based compensation we record share based compensation expense for all share based awards  including stock option grants  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchases 
we calculate share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards expected to ultimately vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience  but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchases 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the price volatility of th e underlying stock  the expected term of our stock options and the risk free interest rate 
a small change in the underlying assumptions can have a relatively large effect on the estimated valuation 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock based on a combination of our stock s historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
we calculate the expected term of our stock options using the simplified method  due to our limited amount of historical option exercise data  and we add a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement eligible pursuant to terms of their award agreements during the contractual term 
the simplified method uses an average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option to calculate the expected term 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards represents the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
accounting for income taxes current income taxes are determined based on estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
provisions are made for both us and any foreign deferred income tax liability or benefit 
we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
in fiscal  we elected to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us rather than repatriating the earnings to the us see note for additional information on income taxes 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into certain unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements on a quarterly basis and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accr uals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

index results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in revenue was driven by a million increase in sales volume  a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes  and million due to a slightly higher priced product mix  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million due to a lower weighted average selling price for our cmp consumable products 
we began to see improvement in economic and industry conditions during the second half of our fiscal these improvements  particularly in the semiconductor industry  continued through our fiscal and positively impacted the demand for our products 
we noted some positive signs of growth in the semiconductor industry in the overview section of this md a including reports from customers indicate that capacity utilization in fabs is currently at an all time high  semiconductor device inventories appear to be at an appropriate level  and capacity expansions by a number of semiconductor manufacturers are underway 
however  we remain cautious regarding future demand trends over the near term as we are entering a calendar period of typically lower seasonal demand within the semiconductor industry and we cannot predict the exact timing and magnitude of a continued economic recovery 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million from increased sales volume due to the increased demand for our products associated with the economic and industry recovery  and an million increase due to higher fixed costs 
these costs were partially offset by a million decrease due to higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity on the increased sales volume  and a million benefit of a lower cost product mix 

index metal oxides  such as silica and alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more financial information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  energy costs may also impact the cost of raw materials  packaging  freight and labor costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the significant increase in sales volume and the related increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  as well as a higher valued product mix  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average selling price of our cmp slurries and increased fixed manufacturing costs 
we expect our gross profit percentage for full fiscal year to be in the range of to 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in our product mix  which may cau se our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was mainly due to million in higher staffing related costs  primarily related to our annual incentive bonus program  million in higher travel related costs  and million in higher office equipment expenses  partially offset by the absence of million in pre tax impairment charges recorded on certain research and development equipment during fiscal our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp consumable products  including collaborating on joint development projects with our customers  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  technical support of cmp products in our customers manufacturing facilities  and evaluation and development of new polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our annual incentive bonus program  million in higher travel related costs  million in higher depreciation expense  and million in higher professional fees 

index general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was mainly due to million in higher staffing related costs  primarily related to our annual incentive bonus program  million in higher professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property  and million in higher travel related expenses  partially offset by million due to lower bad debt expense 
see part i  item entitled legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the enforcement of our intellectual property 
purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development ipr d expense was million in fiscal  related to the acquisition of epoch in the second quarter of fiscal we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal other income expense  net other expense was million in fiscal  compared to other income of million during fiscal the decrease in other income was primarily due to million in lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on our cash balances and investments  and million due to net unfavorable foreign exchange effects on revenues and expenses  primarily related to changes in the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar  net of the gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decreases in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to our election to permanently reinvest earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the us  as well as decreased tax expense related to share based compensation 
increases in the effective tax rate in fiscal that partially offset these decreases included decreases in tax exempt interest income and the present expiration of the research and experimentation tax credit effective december  as discussed above in the overview section of this md a  our election to permanently reinvest earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us reduced our effective tax rate in fiscal by percentage points 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
the election to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us increased net income by million in fiscal 
index year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal of this decrease  million was due to decreased sales volume driven by the significant weakening of demand for our products due to the global economic recession that we experienced during the first half of fiscal  and million due to product mix 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by million in revenue from epoch products  a million revenue increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and million due to a higher weighted average selling price for our cmp consumable products 
despite the negative effects of the global economic recession on our slurry products for semiconductor applicat ions and on our esf business  our revenue from cmp polishing pads and slurries for data storage applications increased from the prior year 
we believe a combination of improved underlying demand and inventory replenishment within the semiconductor industry positively impacted demand for our products during the second half of fiscal as our revenues improved significantly from the revenues recorded in the first half of the fiscal year 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million from decreased sales volume due to the global economic recession  million from lower fixed manufacturing costs and million due to higher manufacturing yields in our cmp slurry and pad production 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase due to a higher cost product mix  a million increase due to lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity on the decreased level of sales  a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and a million increase in certain other manufacturing variances 
we implemented a number of cost saving initiatives during the first half of fiscal for example  we shortened work schedules in our manufacturing operations on a global basis to more closely match production with demand  but we maintained the flexibility to increase our production levels to meet the increased customer demand for our products that we experienced during the second half of fiscal gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity on the significantly lower level of sales and a higher cost product mix  partially offset by lower fixed manufacturing costs and favorable production yields 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily related to million in lower staffing related costs  million in lower depreciation expense and million in lower travel related costs 
these cost decreases were partially offset by million in pre tax impairments recorded in fiscal on certain research and development equipment and million in higher expenses for laboratory supplies 

index selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to million in lower staffing related costs  million in lower travel related costs  million in lower advertising and trade show costs and million in lower professional fees 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from million in lower staffing related costs  primarily related to our annual incentive bonus program and lower share based compensation expense  and million in lower professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property 
these cost savings were partially offset by a million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to customer bankruptcies and increased risks relating to customer collections due to the continued uncertainty in the global economy 
purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development ipr d expense was million in fiscal  related to the acquisition of epoch in the second quarter of fiscal we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal other income  net other income was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease in other income was primarily due to million in lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on our lower average balances of cash and short term investments 
we monetized the majority of our short term investments in ars during fiscal and reinvested these funds into money market investments which earn interest at lower rates 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to increased tax expense related to share based compensation and a decrease in tax exempt interest income  partially offset by increased research and experimentation tax credits 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
the acquisition of epoch was accretive to earnings in fiscal 
index liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal originated from million in net income  million in non cash items  and a million increase in cash flow due to a net decrease in working capital 
the increase in cash from operations in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased net income in fiscal due to the improved economic and industry conditions and the timing of accounts payable and accrued liability payments  including the accrual of our annual incentive bonus program expenses related to fiscal these were partially offset by increases in fiscal in our other cu rrent assets  primarily due to income taxes receivable  and our inventory levels based on the increased demand for our products 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal representing million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and million in other investing cash outflows 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal  representing million used for our acquisition of epoch  net of million in cash acquired  and million in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal were million 
net sales of short term investments were million as we monetized the majority of our ars during fiscal as discussed below 
this cash inflow was partially offset by million in cash used for purchases of property  plant and equipment primarily for the purchase and installation of a millimeter polishing tool and related metrology equipment for our asia pacific technology center and building improvements and equipment to increase our pad production capabilities 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on business combinations and intangible assets 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
we used million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase plan  million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our second amended and restated cabot microelectronics corporation equity incentive plan eip for shares withheld from employees and purchased by the company to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock granted under the eip  and we made million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our eip and our employee stock purchase plan  as amended and restated january  employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  cash flows provided by financing activities were million 
we received million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our eip and our employee stock purchase plan 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million in principal payments on capital leases and million in repurchases of common stock pursuant to the terms of our eip for shares withheld to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock granted under the eip 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
we used million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase programs and we made million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock option s and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in january  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we fund share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
the program became effective on the authorization date and may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
there was million remaining on this authorization as of september  we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility to million 
pursuant to an amendment we entered into in october  the agreement extends to november  with an option to renew for two additional one year terms 
in november  the scheduled termination date was extended by one year through october the amendment did not include any other material changes to the terms of the credit agreement 
under this agreement  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the lending institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we also pay a non use fee 
loans under this facility are intended primarily for general corporate purposes  including financing working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 

index as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we completed the acquisition of epoch during our second quarter of fiscal the total cash outlay was million representing million in cash paid to epoch s shareholders on the first closing date of february   million in cash paid for transaction costs and million paid to eternal on the second closing date in august  which had been in escrow in taiwan  partially offset by million in cash acquired with epoch 
at september   we owned two ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value 
we successfully monetized at par value the majority of ars we owned in fiscal and reinvested these funds in money market accounts 
we believe that we will be able to monetize the remaining two ars at par  either through successful auctions  refinancing of the underlying debt by the issuers  payment by the bond insurance carrier  or holding the securities to maturity 
however  we believe it is not likely that our ars will be monetized within the next operating cycle  which for us is generally one year  so we have classified these securities as long term assets 
we believe that our current balance of cash and long term investments  cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to further expand our business  therefore  we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
depending upon future conditions in the capital and credit markets  we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  our former parent company which is not a related party  under which we agreed to pay cabot corporation for the expansion of a fumed alumina manufacturing facility in tuscola  illinois 
the arrangement for the facility has been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments resulted in an initial million lease obligation and related leased asset 
the initial term of the agreement expired in december  but it was renewed for another five year term ending in december 
index operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years of their respective commencement dates and may be renewed by us 
operating lease obligations also include certain costs associated with our pad finishing operation located at taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  which are accounted for as operating lease payments 
purchase obligations we have entered into multi year supply agreements with cabot corporation for the purchase of certain fumed metal oxides 
we purchase fumed silica primarily under a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation that became effective in january  and was amended in september and in april  the latter of which extended the termination date of the agreement from december to december and also changed the pricing and some other non material terms of the agreement to the benefit of both parties 
the agreement will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we are generally obligated to purchase fumed silica for at least of our six m onth volume forecast for certain of our slurry products  to purchase certain non material minimum quantities every six months  and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than these amounts 
we currently anticipate meeting all minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
since december  we have purchased fumed alumina primarily under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation that has an original term ending in december and was renewed for another five year term ending in december prices charged for fumed alumina from cabot corporation are pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement and may fluctuate based upon the actual costs incurred by cabot corporation in the manufacture of fumed alumina 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be the exclusive supplier of certain quantities and types of fumed silica and fumed alumina for certain products we produced as of the effective dates of these agreements 
 subject to certain terms  cabot corporation is prohibited from selling certain types of fumed alumina to third parties for use in cmp applications  as well as engaging itself in cmp applications 
if cabot corporation fails to supply us with our requirements for any reason  including if we require product specification changes that cabot corporation cannot meet  we have the right to purchase products meeting those specifications from other suppliers 
we also may purchase fumed alumina and fumed silica from other suppliers for certain products  including those commercialized after certain dates related to these agreements and their amendments 
purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of million of contractual commitments related to our cabot corporation agreements for fumed silica and fumed alumina 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities at september  consist of liabilities related to our japan retirement allowance and our liability for uncertain tax positions 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and the new taiwan dollar and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
during fiscal  we recorded million in foreign currency translation gains that are included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains primarily relate to general fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
however  we also incur expenses in foreign countries that are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar  so the net exposure on the consolidated statement of income is limited 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures 
market risk related to investments in auction rate securities at september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with a total estimated fair value of million million par value which were classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in  general uncertainties in the global credit markets caused widespread ars auction failures as the number of securities submitted for sale exceeded the number of securities buyers were willing to purchase 
as a result  the short term liquidity of the ars market has been adversely affected
