financial liquidity and capital resources overview as a distributor  the company s use of capital is largely for working capital to support its revenue base 
capital commitments for property  plant and equipment are limited to information technology assets  warehouse equipment  office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  since the company operates almost entirely from leased facilities 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations will primarily be due to changes in working capital as a result of the rate of increases or decreases to sales 
in periods when sales are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded first by cash from operations  secondly from additional borrowings and lastly from additional equity offerings 
in periods when sales are decreasing  the company will have improved cash flows due to reduced working capital requirements 
during such periods  the company will use the expanded cash flow to reduce the amount of leverage in its capital structure until such time as the outlook for improved economic conditions and growth are clear 
also  the company will  from time to time  issue or retire borrowings or equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with its anticipated capital requirements

the company anticipates that the economic recovery that began in the second half of will be less robust than the experience of other recent past recession recoveries

results of operations executive overview and outlook the weak economic conditions that persisted throughout led to sales of  million  a decline versus the prior year sales of  million 
after adjusting for million of negative foreign exchange effects  an estimated million of negative copper prices effects and eliminating the sales of million associated with acquisitions  the company had an organic sales decline of approximately 
all geographic segments  as well as all end markets enterprise cabling and security  electrical wire and cable and oem supply reported year on year sales declines 
while sales declined from  the company experienced flat daily sales run rates during most of  with variations in consecutive quarter sales being  in large part  attributable to differences in the number of shipping days in a quarter due to holidays 
while commodity prices and exchange rates displayed a fair amount of volatility during the year  the effects were muted by the overriding impact of the weak economy on customer demand levels 
the sales declines were disproportionately weighted to our higher gross margin products within oem supply where we saw a organic decline in sales  and within electrical wire and cable  which reported a decline in sales in at the same time  there was a further unfavorable sales mix shift during the year as we saw an organic sales decline of in europe  our highest gross margin geographic segment  versus for the company in total 
in  the company recorded a million reduction to gross profit due to an exchange rate driven lower of cost or market adjustment on inventory in venezuela 
in  the company also recorded a million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment in europe 
as a result of these factors  gross margins declined to in from in the prior year 
operating expense control was a high priority throughout the year as the company continued to evaluate activity levels and productivity to ensure its expense structure was sized to meet the realities of the economy while at the same time balancing the company s short term objectives with its longer term strategies and programs 
the company reacted to the market conditions by reducing headcount by in in addition  the company extended salary review cycles from a normal months to months  recorded lower incentive compensation expense based on the decline in operating performance and tightly controlled variable expenses 
all of these actions were taken with a goal of balancing short term expense reductions with preserving the long term capabilities and institutional knowledge that are critical to excellent customer service 
despite the expense reductions  the effects of lower sales volumes  weaker gross margins and the effect on gross profit from lower copper prices resulted in a decline in operating margins in in addition  operating losses and an outlook for a weak economic recovery in europe also led to a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million for the company s european operations during the second quarter 
while the weak economy led to significant year on year declines in sales and operating earnings  the company moved quickly to substantially reduce the amount of working capital in the business 
working capital reductions of million contributed to the million of cash flows from operating activities for the year 
operating income of million in was significantly lower than operating income of million in as a result of lower sales and gross margins as well as the impairment charge of million in europe  operating margins were in compared to in the prior year 
the impairment charge reduced operating margins by basis points in recent acquisitions  unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower copper prices decreased the company s year to date operating income by million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of issuing the notes due in the first quarter of  the company s weighted average cost of borrowed capital increased to from in the prior year 
despite the fact that the company was able to generate significant cash flow and reduce outstanding borrowings by approximately million during the year  the higher interest rates resulted in a increase in interest expense in as compared to as the company retired debt in the later months of the year  including the repurchase of million of the notes due and million of convertible notes  a net loss of million on the retirement of debt was incurred 
in  the company recognized foreign exchange losses of million associated with its venezuela operations and a loss of million associated with the cancellation of interest rate hedging contracts as a result of the repayment of the related borrowings 
these losses were partially offset by a gain of million related to the increase in the value of company owned life insurance policies associated with the company s deferred compensation program 
in the prior year  the company recorded a loss of million related to foreign exchange and a loss of million related to the decline in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies 
the tax provision for was million which resulted in an effective tax rate of after excluding the non deductible impairment charge to goodwill 
the tax provision was reduced by million of net tax benefits related primarily to the reversal of a valuation allowance 
excluding the impairment charge  severance costs  losses due cancellation of interest rate swaps  early retirement of debt  foreign exchange related losses in venezuela and the tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate in was 
the tax provision for was million and the effective tax rate was  inclusive of million of net tax benefits related to the reversal of valuation allowances associated with certain foreign nol carryforwards 
excluding the tax benefits and a number of items that decreased net income by million in  the company s effective tax rate in was see the versus consolidated results of operations section included herein for further information regarding these items 
the increase in the effective tax rate in reflects the larger effects of permanent differences in taxable income versus reported income on a smaller pretax income base and significant changes in country level profitability 
the combined effects of the reduced operating earnings driven by the various factors identified above resulted in a net loss of million in as compared to net income of million in diluted loss per share for fiscal of was impacted by due to the previously mentioned impairment charge  severance costs  losses due to the cancellation of interest rate swaps  early retirement of debt and foreign exchange related losses in venezuela which were partially offset by the tax benefits as discussed 
exclusive of these items  diluted earnings per share was as compared to in the prior year  which included a number of items that decreased dilutive earnings per share by see the versus consolidated results of operations section included herein for further information regarding these items 
primarily as a result of the company s share repurchases during the last year and less dilution related to the company s convertible notes  the diluted weighted average common shares declined by in versus the company s operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper  which are components in some of the products sold 
generally  as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  the company s mark up percentage to customers remains relatively constant  resulting in higher sales revenue and gross profit 
in addition  existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase may result in a higher gross profit margin 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect  negatively affecting financial results 
the degree to which spot market copper prices change affects product prices and the amount of gross profit earned will be affected by end market demand and overall economic conditions 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of higher copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
therefore  all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates 
from through the third quarter of  the company s financial performance benefited from historically high copper prices 
however  during the fourth quarter of and continuing through the third quarter of  copper prices declined from these historically high prices 
market based copper prices averaged approximately per pound during compared to per pound in as a result  sales and operating income were unfavorably affected by million and million  respectively 
outlook the company ended in a healthy financial position  with cash and cash equivalent balances of million  approximately million less in borrowings than at the beginning of the year  million in available  unused bank revolving credit facilities and only million of borrowings under a million accounts receivable securitization facility 
looking forward to  the company expects that the economic recovery will be slow to unfold and that sales growth  while positive  will be modest 
this modest sales growth  combined with anticipated improvements in the sales mix  is expected to drive modest gross margin improvement and improved operating leverage 
at the same time  the company anticipates some reduction in interest cost on lower borrowings and a lower effective tax rate due to improved profitability  especially in europe 
if the company generates these improvements in profitability it would expect to see improved cash flow from earnings 
at the same time  the modest levels of anticipated sales growth will mean minimal additional working capital investments 
while the company does not expect a repeat of the cash flow  which was driven by significant working capital reductions  it nonetheless anticipates strong cash flow 
this cash flow will further enhance the liquidity position of the company during and position it for long term growth 
while the company will consider acquisition opportunities that fit well with its business model and strategies  at this time it is not expected that significant acquisition investments will be made during unless there is a more robust economic recovery than is currently envisioned 
the company will continue to pursue debt reductions and evaluate share repurchases in order to balance the need for financial flexibility  in less than certain economic times  with a goal of achieving better utilization of capital and cost of capital optimization

critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas of accounting that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management

the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at the outstanding balance less the estimated net realizable value

these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected future usage  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  historical consumption experience  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventories 
pension expense accounting rules related to pensions and the policies used by the company generally reduce the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the net benefit cost  as any significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of the plan participants 
these actuarial gains and losses are mainly attributable to the return on plan assets that differ from that assumed and differences in the obligation due to changes in the discount rate  plan demographic changes and other assumptions 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with us gaap is the expected return on plan assets 
in  the company assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year ended as a result of the combined effect of valuation increases in both the equity and bond markets  the plan assets produced an actual gain of approximately in as compared to a loss of in as a result  the fair value of plan assets increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal when the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is significant  the difference is amortized into expense over the service lives of the plan participants 
these amounts are reflected on the balance sheet through charges to other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
the measurement date for all plans of the company is december st 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities to their present value 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate at the end of and  the company reviewed rates of return on relevant market indices  specifically  the citigroup pension liability index 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at january  and january   the company determined the consolidated weighted average rate of all plans to be and  respectively  and used this rate to measure the projected benefit obligation at the end of each respective fiscal year end 
as a result of the change in the discount rate as well as changes in foreign exchange rates  the projected benefit obligation increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of the change in asset values and the projected benefit obligation  the company s consolidated net pension liability was million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of based on the consolidated weighted average discount rate at the beginning of and and  respectively  the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million in  up from million in the company estimates its net periodic cost to increase by approximately primarily due to a decrease in discount rates 
due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at january  of million 
a basis point decline in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in an increase in the expense of approximately million 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments of north america  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on management s forecast of each reporting unit 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units from the perspective of market participants 
the company also reviews market multiple information to corroborate the fair value conclusions recorded through the aforementioned income approach 
if the first step indicates a potential impairment  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the company s annual impairment test performed at the beginning of the third quarter of and the interim impairment test in the fourth quarter of did not result in an impairment charge for goodwill 
however  as a result of the continued downturn in global economic conditions during  the company s north america  europe and asia pacific reporting units experienced a severe decline in sales  margins and profitability as compared to both the prior year and the projections that were made at the end of fiscal in  the company experienced a flat daily sales trend through the first and second quarters 
the resulting effect was that the company did not experience the normal sequential growth pattern from the first to the second quarter 
because of those flat daily sales patterns  on a sequential basis  reported sales were actually down from the first quarter of when the second quarter of sequential drop in reported sales was evaluated against the second quarter of  when the company experienced a more traditional pattern of sequential growth from the first to the second quarter  the result was the largest negative sales comparison experienced since the current economic downturn began 
due to these market and economic conditions  the company concluded that there were impairment indicators for the north america  europe and asia pacific reporting units that required an interim impairment analysis be performed under us gaap as of the end of fiscal may in connection with the impairment analysis  the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the europe reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of europe s assets and liabilities  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the price paid to acquire it was the fair value 
the analysis indicated that there would be an implied value attributable to goodwill of million in the europe reporting unit and accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to the write off of the remaining goodwill of million associated with its europe reporting unit 
the company subsequently performed its annual impairment test at the beginning of the third quarter of this did not result in any additional impairment charge for goodwill 
the company currently expects the carrying amount of remaining goodwill to be fully recoverable 
as of january   the company does not have any material indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company s intangible assets include definite lived intangibles which are primarily related to customer relationships 
the impairment test for these intangible assets is conducted when impairment indicators are present 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
the company analyzed its definite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of and determined that all of them would be recoverable 
deferred tax assets the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
assessments are made at each balance sheet date to determine how much of each deferred tax asset is realizable 
these estimates are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions  based upon the technical support for the positions  the company s past audit experience with similar situations  and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
management believes these reserves represent the best estimate of the amount that the company will ultimately be required to pay to settle the matters 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
as of january   the aggregate amount of global uncertain tax position liabilities and related interest recorded was approximately million 
the uncertain tax positions cover a wide range of issues and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions 
the single largest item million relates to an ongoing examination by uk tax authorities related to certain expenses of an acquired group of companies 
other significant exposures for which reserves exist include  but are not limited to  a variety of foreign and state jurisdictional transfer pricing disputes and foreign withholding tax issues related to inter company transfers and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its derivative contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in other income 
during periods of volatility in foreign exchange rates  the company can be subject to significant foreign exchange gains and losses since there is a time lag between when the company incurs the foreign exchange exposure and when the company has the information to properly hedge the exposure 
foreign exchange risk the company s foreign currency denominated sales were in and in and the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to europe euro and british pound and canada canadian dollar 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as argentina peso  australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  colombia peso  mexico peso  and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation using period end exchange rates  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the assets and liabilities related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in addition  as the company s subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate translation adjustment risk 
several of the company s subsidiaries conduct business in a currency other than the legal entity s functional currency 
transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction 
that increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currency denominated accounts on its reported income 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its foreign currency forward contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
at january  and january   the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its foreign currency forward contracts assuming a adverse change in the value of foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the hypothetical adverse changes would have decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
venezuela foreign exchange the company s functional currency for financial reporting purposes in venezuela is the us dollar usd 
inventory is sourced from vendors in the united states including the parent company of the venezuelan operations  anixter inc and paid for in usd 
sales to customers are invoiced in the local bolivar currency and bolivars are collected from customers to settle outstanding receivables 
during  local government restrictions made it increasingly difficult to transfer cash out of venezuela 
the company utilized the parallel market which involves using bolivars to purchase venezuelan securities and then swap those securities for usd denominated investments to obtain usd to settle usd liabilities 
the use of this parallel market results in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared with the official rate in venezuela 
in december of  the venezuela operations remitted cash to its us parent using the parallel market  resulting in a million realized pre tax foreign exchange loss  which was recorded within other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  as a result of the factors that led to increased usage of the parallel market  including the december cash remittance to the parent  the company re evaluated its historical practice of remeasuring bolivar denominated monetary assets primarily cash and accounts receivable into usd using the official exchange rate for financial reporting purposes 
the company determined that due to the change of circumstances described above  and the expected continued use of the parallel market for repatriating cash from venezuela  use of the parallel rate for remeasurement purposes was most appropriate 
the result of using the unfavorable parallel exchange rate to remeasure these assets was a million pre tax loss recorded during the fourth quarter within other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  the company currently has binding orders from customers at a price that  when remeasured to usd using the parallel rate  will not allow the company to recover the historical cost of its inventory 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax lower of cost or market inventory charge of approximately million through cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the objective of the currently outstanding interest rate swaps cash flow hedges is to convert variable interest to fixed interest associated with forecasted interest payments resulting from revolving borrowings in the uk and continental europe and are designated as hedging instruments 
the company does not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
changes in the value of the interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to fluctuations in the variable rates 
the company s counterparties to its interest rate swap contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
when entered into  these financial instruments were designated as hedges of underlying exposures interest payments associated with the uk and continental europe borrowings attributable to changes in the respective benchmark interest rates 
currently  the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined by means of a mathematical model that calculates the present value of the anticipated cash flows from the transaction using mid market prices and other economic data and assumptions  or by means of pricing indications from one or more other dealers selected at the discretion of the respective banks 
these inputs would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
at january  and january   interest rate swaps were revalued at current interest rates  with the changes in valuation reflected directly in other comprehensive income  net of associated deferred taxes 
the fair market value of the company s outstanding interest rate agreements  which is the estimated exit price that the company would pay to cancel the interest rate agreements  was not significant at january  or january  the company prepared a sensitivity analysis assuming a adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fair market value of debt instruments the company s fixed rate debt primarily consists of the senior notes specifically  notes due and notes due and convertible debt instruments specifically  notes due and notes due 
at january   the company s carrying value of its fixed rate debt was million as compared to million at january  the increase in the carrying value of fixed rate debt is primarily a result of the issuance of the notes due the combined estimated fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt at january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the fair value of fixed rate debt is also the result of the issuance of the notes due as well as the increase in the company s stock price during which increased the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the fair value of the company s debt instruments is measured using observable market information which would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
the company s notes due and notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of and  respectively 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the notes due or the notes due  but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the notes due and the notes due would decrease by and at january  and at january   respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and at january  and at january   respectively 
primarily as a result of the issuance of the notes due  as of january  the fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments increased to million from million at january   respectively 
the company has outstanding debt that may be converted into the company s common stock 
accordingly  the price of its common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt increased to million at january  from million at january  due to the increase in the company s stock price during fiscal a hypothetical decrease in the price of the company s common stock from the price at january  and january  would have reduced the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
