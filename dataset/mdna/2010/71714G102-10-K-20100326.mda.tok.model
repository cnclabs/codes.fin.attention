item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with i our consolidated financial statements  which present our results of operations for the years ended december  and as well as our financial positions at december  and  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and ii our annual report on form k for the year ended december  filed on march   including the consolidated financial statements contained therein  and the form k a filed on june  presenting the historical financial statements for the vaccines business acquired from avecia 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biodefense company engaged in the development and commercialization of medical countermeasures against biological and chemical weapons 
we currently have five product candidates in various stages of development sparvax  a second generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine  valortim  a fully human monoclonal antibody an identical population of highly specific antibodies produced from a single clone for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection  protexia  a recombinant enzyme butyrylcholinesterase  which mimics a natural bioscavenger for the prevention or treatment of nerve agent poisoning by organophosphate compounds  including nerve gases and pesticides  a third generation rpa anthrax vaccine  and rypvax  a recombinant dual antigen vaccine for pneumonic and bubonic plague ryp 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  ie  they affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of difficult  subjective and complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue from two different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts and cost reimbursable grants 
costs consist primarily of actual internal labor charges and external sub contractor costs incurred plus an allocation of applied fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses as defined in the contract 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts are recognized in an amount equal to the costs incurred during the period plus an estimate of the applicable fee earned 
the estimate of the applicable fee earned is determined by reference to the contract if the contract defines the fee in terms of risk based milestones and specifies the fees to be earned upon the completion of each milestone  then the fee is recognized when the related milestones are earned 
otherwise  we compute fee income earned in a given period by using a proportional performance method based on costs incurred during the period as compared to total estimated project costs and application of the resulting fraction to the total project fee specified in the contract 
we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to determine whether we should report such reimbursements as revenue or as an offset to our expenses incurred 
in and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of costs reimbursed by the government as an offset to research and development expenses 
our revenue generating contracts may include multiple elements  including one or more of up front license fees  research payments  and milestone payments 
in these situations  we allocate the total contract price to the multiple elements based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue for each element according to its characteristics 
as revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the contracts  related amounts are recorded as unbilled receivables  the primary component of other receivables including unbilled receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
as specific contract invoices are generated and sent to our customers  invoiced amounts are transferred out of unbilled receivables and into billed accounts receivable 
invoicing frequency and payment terms for cost plus fee contracts with our customers are defined within each contract  but are typically monthly invoicing with day payment cycles 
during  our development agreement for sparvax  our second generation rpa anthrax vaccine  was i transferred from nih to barda  ii novated from our uk subsidiary to the us parent corporation  pharmathene  inc  and iii revised with regard to the scope and timing of work under that agreement 
during the period that this agreement was being implemented  we agreed with our customer to delay invoicing under that contract  which resulted in a significant increase in unbilled receivables 
we believe that these unbilled receivables represent valid  chargeable program expenses and we expect to invoice and collect them in research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred  advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs 
research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
share based payments we expense all share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their estimated fair value at date of grant 
costs of all share based payments are recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie usually the vesting period and charged to the functional operating expense associated with that employee 
intangible assets because of the nature of pharmaceutical research  and particularly because of the difficulties associated with efficacy studies in humans related to the bioterrorist products with which we work and the government s related funding provisions  factors that affect the estimate of the life of an asset are often more uncertain than with respect to other non bioterrorist pharmaceutical research 
on an annual basis  we assess recoverability of intangible assets from future operations  using undiscounted future cash flows derived from the intangible assets 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value  which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows  in certain situations  where the carrying value is dependent upon the outcome of a single study and that study is unsuccessful  that impairment may be significant in amount and immediate in timing 
results of operations revenue we recognized revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our revenue consisted primarily of contract funding from the us government for the development of protexia  sparvax and valortim 
our revenue in the year ended december  changed from the comparable period of due to the following under the september contract with the dod for the advanced development of protexia  we recognized million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant decline in revenue in is primarily attributable to the shift of our protexia program from broad pre clinical development efforts  including manufacturing  to a focus on clinical evaluation as well as the completion  during the third quarter of  of all work and related funding under the initial phase of the contract with the dod 
it is unclear at this point when the dod will make a decision regarding funding for the next phase of the development work for protexia although the government has recently indicated that it may make a decision before the end of the third quarter 
until a funding decision is made  we do not expect to recognize significant additional revenues under this contract 
under our contract for the development of sparvax  acquired as part of the avecia acquisition in april  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue for only includes revenue recognized from and after april   the closing date of the avecia acquisition 
the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to i the inclusion of a full year s worth of activity in as compared to only nine months in the period after the avecia acquisition in april  and ii increased costs and corresponding revenues incurred in connection with our june settlement agreement with avecia  including million related to past performance and raw materials under our agreement with them  offset in part by a decline in development activities in early as we stopped our development work at avecia  revised our development plan  and commenced our efforts to transfer technology from avecia to diosynth  a us based bulk drug substance manufacturer 
under the september contract for the advanced development of valortim  we recognized million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the reimbursement of higher costs related to non clinical studies as well other development work in as we prepared for and commenced human clinical trials 
the second phase i clinical trial related to valortim  commenced in august  was placed on partial clinical hold pending the outcome of an investigation  after the occurrence of two adverse reactions in the four subjects dosed  one of which was characterized by clinical investigators as a serious adverse event 
it is unclear at this time how long it will take us to complete our investigation  if and when we will be in a position to recommence negotiations with barda with respect to a potential award under baa barda for additional advanced development of valortim  and what the effect of any delay in potential future funding of the program will be on the overall valortim development timeline 
under our september contract award for the additional development work on our third generation rpa anthrax vaccine  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we began work under this contract in the fourth quarter in february  we received notice from the niaid raising concerns regarding performance under our existing contract with them related to our third generation anthrax vaccine program  and directing us to explain how we plan to cure the deficiencies 
in accordance with the timeline specified by niaid  we responded in march proposing  among other things  a revised development program and timeline 
under our contract for the advanced development of our plague vaccine  rypvax  acquired as part of the avecia acquisition in april  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we and the us government have agreed to a reduction to the scope of work under this contract  as a result  all activities under the contract are winding down  with wind down expected to be completed in the first half of we do not anticipate that the us government will provide additional funding in the future for or procure rypvax 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses resulted from research and development activities related to our valortim and protexia programs as well as from activities related to the sparvax  rypvax and third generation anthrax vaccine programs 
we incurred both direct expenses  which included salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies  and an allocation of indirect expenses 
we also incurred third party costs  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs for individual projects 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were net of cost reimbursements under certain of our government grants of million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were attributable to research programs as follows year ended in millions december  december  anthrax therapeutic and vaccines chemical nerve agent protectants recombinant dual antigen plague vaccine internal research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased million from the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in pre clinical development costs for our chemical nerve agent protectants program as we progressed in our clinical evaluation phase  and a reduction in development costs for our plague vaccine program  partially offset by increased pre clinical development associated with our anthrax related therapeutics and vaccines programs 
the decrease in development expenses related to the clinical nerve agent protectants program resulted from reduced process development and manufacturing activities as the program moved from the development stage to the phase i clinical trial 
expenses in connection with the anthrax therapeutics and vaccines programs increased primarily as a result of increased pre clinical development activity in as we prepared for and started phase i human clinical trials  along with increased costs incurred in connection with our june settlement agreement with avecia 
as we note above  we and the us government have agreed to a reduction to the scope of work related to the development our plague vaccine  and expect the costs and related revenue under that contract to decline over the wind down period 
until such time as the dod decides  if ever  to continue to fund work under our chemical nerve agent protectants program  costs incurred in this program in future periods will not be covered  either in whole or in part  by corresponding revenues under our contract with the dod 
if the dod does consent to further work under this program  we anticipate that costs under our chemical nerve agent protectants program will increase in future periods as that program progresses through human clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative functions include executive management  finance and administration  government affairs and regulations  corporate development  human resources  legal  and compliance 
for each function  we may incur expenses such as salaries  supplies and third party consulting and other external costs and non cash expenditures such as expense related to stock option and restricted share awards 
an allocation of indirect costs such as facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead is also included in general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with general and administrative functions were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the costs associated with the transitioning of our development and manufacturing activities for our sparvax and third generation anthrax vaccine programs as well as other general and administrative functions from the uk to the us  and with preparing and submitting various bids and proposals  along with increased stock based compensation costs during the year 
acquired in process research and development during the year ended december   we completed the avecia acquisition 
the primary asset acquired in the avecia acquisition was sparvax  a second generation rpa anthrax vaccine 
the value of the third generation anthrax vaccine acquired in the transaction was aggregated with that of the second generation vaccine because success in developing the third generation anthrax vaccine is contingent on the successful development of the second generation vaccine 
at the acquisition date  the aggregate fair value of the second and third generation vaccines was estimated at million 
an income approach methodology was used to determine the fair value of the acquired in process research and development asset 
this approach assessed the expected cash flows  net of expected appropriate operating expenses  generated from the acquisition date in april through the end of the expected life of the vaccine using a risk adjusted discount rate of  which we believe is commensurate with an early stage biodefense product development opportunity of this nature 
in connection with the transaction  in we recorded a charge to expense for acquired in process research and development of million for these acquired research projects for which  at the acquisition date  technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future use existed 
no such charge was recorded in both vaccines are in their early stages of development and significant remaining research and development is required to establish the technological feasibility of these vaccines 
the cost and time required to complete the development of these vaccines and earn fda marketing approval is highly uncertain and can vary significantly 
during  we provided the us government with a series of development plans for sparvax  in response to their request for proposal  which estimated that it would cost in excess of million over approximately five years to complete the development of sparvax 
no such estimates of the advanced development costs and timeline for the third generation vaccine have been developed 
as with all development efforts in the biodefense industry  the development of our second and third generation anthrax vaccines is subject to delays  as described in risk factors necessary reliance on the animal rule in conducting trials is time consuming and expensive and we have not commercialized any products or recognized any revenues from sales 
all of our product candidates are still under development  and there can be no assurance of successful commercialization of any of our products 
our development costs will increase substantially if we experience material delays in any clinical trials or if we need to conduct more or larger trials than planned 
depreciation and intangible amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses relate primarily to the depreciation and amortization of farm building improvements  leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment  and patents acquired as part of a business combination 
other income and expenses other income and expenses primarily consists of income on our investments  interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations  changes in market value of our derivative financial instruments  loss on early extinguishment of debt  and foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized interest income on our investments of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income during the periods is primarily attributable to the reduced average balances of our investments and cash balances as we continue to use cash to support our operations  along with lower prevailing interest rates 
we incurred interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense relates primarily to interest on our outstanding convertible notes including the amortization of the debt discount arising from the i allocation of fair value to the stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the convertible debt and ii beneficial conversion feature and our senior secured credit facility  which facility we repaid in full in july the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase from relates to the underlying change in the estimated fair value of various stock purchase warrants issued in and and the embedded conversion option in the convertible senior notes that were exchanged or matured in the fair value of these derivative instruments is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in connection with the july private placement  we exchanged a portion of our old notes in the aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest of million  for new convertible notes  cancelled the corresponding old notes  issued additional new convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million to new note investors  and issued to the recipients of the new convertible notes certain stock purchase warrants 
in connection with the exchange  we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of the old notes of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements through the end of are to fund our operations including our research and development programs and support our general and administrative activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and any future change in our business strategy 
these cash requirements could change materially as a result of shifts in our business and strategy 
since our inception  we have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes  proceeds from loans and other borrowings  and the trust funds obtained in the merger 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
we believe that the funds obtained from the july private placement  existing cash resources  along with cash receipts from contract receivables a substantial portion of which was unbilled at december  generated under our contracts will be sufficient to enable us to fund our existing research and development programs and support our currently anticipated general and administrative activities through the end of we have based this projection on our current and anticipated operations  which do not take into account any potential future government contracts that may be awarded to the company  merger and acquisition or corporate partnering activities  or unexpected financial obligations 
however  to the extent that we are unable to collect our receivables on a timely basis  we may be required to seek short term financing solutions  including either short term indebtedness or through the sale of equity 
the turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or cease operations has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
as a result  there can be no assurance that future funding will be available to us on reasonably acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the us government s substantial efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the biodefense field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend any of its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
finally  the note and warrant purchase agreement entered into in connection with the july private placement prevents us from incurring senior indebtedness other than trade payables in excess of million without the prior written approval of no less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the debt then outstanding 
we have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses in conducting further research and development activities 
we do not have commercial products and  given the substantial costs relating to the development of pharmaceutical products  have relatively limited existing capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional funds to support our research and development efforts 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient future financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to secure additional funding through government contracts and grants 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result if the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities are not realized 
sources and uses of cash cash  cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in was primarily attributable to net cash used in our operations of approximately million  capital expenditures of approximately million  and payment of deferred consideration related to the avecia acquisition of million  offset by net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million 
in addition  billings under some of our contracts were delayed in  resulting in a significant net increase in our total unbilled receivables in of million as described above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
as of december  and  total accounts receivables and other receivables including unbilled receivables were million and million  respectively 
in march  we closed on the public sale of  newly issued shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants became exercisable on september  and will expire on september  upon the closing of the avecia acquisition  in addition to certain initial consideration paid at that time  we also provided a letter of credit in the amount of million as security for deferred consideration in that same amount 
pursuant to the settlement agreement with avecia entered into as of june   we paid the million deferred consideration to avecia during the second quarter in connection with which the letter of credit securing such amount was terminated and the required cash restrictions eliminated 
in the july private placement  we issued approximately million of new convertible notes  convertible immediately into common shares at a conversion price of approximately per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants became exercisable on january  and will expire on january  as part of this transaction we exchanged a portion of our old notes in the aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest of million for new convertible notes  cancelled the corresponding old notes  issued additional new convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million to new note investors  and issued to the recipients of the new convertible notes the stock purchase warrants described above 
in connection with the exchange  we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of the old notes of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from the sale of the new convertible notes to repay million of our old notes that were not exchanged for the new convertible notes and warrants and repaid all outstanding amounts and fees under our existing senior secured credit facility 
potential future amounts payable under the purchase agreement with avecia in connection with the avecia acquisition  certain amounts may become payable to avecia assuming certain milestones are achieved  including the following i million within days of entry by us into a multi year funded development contract to be issued by barda part of dhhs under solicitation number rfp barda or any substitution or replacement thereof for the further development of sparvax  and ii million within days of entry by us into a contract or contracts for the supply of sparvax into the sns  and iii of pharmathene net sales of sparvax to the us government within the period of ten years from the closing of the avecia acquisition after the first million doses  and iv of pharmathene net sales of third generation anthrax vaccine to the us government within the period of ten years from the closing of the avecia acquisition 
in addition to the potential milestone payments described above  for a period of ten years following our first purchase of bulk drug substance for the anthrax and plague vaccines drug substance from a supplier other than avecia  we may be obligated to pay avecia up to of the amounts that would have been payable to avecia had avecia produced the drug substance 
rfp barda was cancelled by barda in december accordingly  our obligation to pay avecia under clause i above would mature only upon our receipt of a substitution or replacement thereof 
we have received funds from barda and other us government agencies under various development agreements between us and barda 
any development contract deemed to be a substitute or replacement of rfp barda could trigger our obligation to make the million payment under i above 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for certain non cash items  including loss on extinguishment of debt of million  share based compensation of million  non cash interest expense of million  an increase in billed accounts receivable of million  an increase in unbilled accounts receivable of million and a net decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
during  our development agreement for sparvax  our second generation rpa anthrax vaccine  was i transferred from nih to barda  ii novated from our uk subsidiary to the us parent corporation  pharmathene  inc  and iii revised with regard to the scope and timing of work under that agreement 
during the period that the changes to our second generation rpa anthrax vaccine contract were being implemented  we agreed with the us government to delay invoicing under that contract  which resulted in a significant increase in unbilled receivables 
we believe that these unbilled receivables represent valid  chargeable program expenses and we expect to invoice and collect them during net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for certain non cash items  including acquired in process research and development related to the avecia acquisition of million  share based compensation of million  non cash interest expense of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  investing activities for related primarily to the payment in june of million of deferred purchase consideration to avecia  and approximately million of capital expenditures 
in and in connection with the avecia acquisition  we paid million to avecia and funded a million letter of credit 
in order to fund the transaction and the restricted cash obligations pursuant to the loan modification agreement under our senior secured credit facility  approximately a net million of available for sale securities were sold 
additionally  during  we incurred approximately million related to transactions costs incurred as a result of the avecia acquisition 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in march  we raised net proceeds of approximately million as a result of the public sale of shares of our common stock and warrants 
we raised million in the july private placement  and used million of those proceeds to repay our existing convertible notes including accrued interest and all amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we exchanged and cancelled million of our then outstanding convertible notes for our newly issued convertible notes and stock purchase warrants 
additionally  pursuant to the payment to avecia of the deferred purchase consideration and the repayment of all amounts due under our credit facility  we eliminated all of our restricted cash obligations approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with leases  research and development arrangements  collaborative development obligations and long term debt contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating facility leases research and development agreements notes payable  including interest total contractual obligations this table does not include any royalty payments of future sales of products subject to license agreements the company has entered into in relation to its in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that any interest rate change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments 
our debt is at rates fixed by the lenders
