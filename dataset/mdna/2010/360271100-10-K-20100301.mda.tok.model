overview net income available to common shareholders increased million  from a net loss available to common shareholders of million in to net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share in the key themes that characterized the corporation s performance in were significant deposit growth  growth in non interest income  effective expense management and  most notably  managing credit quality in the recent  challenging economic environment 
the corporation grew ending deposits by billion  or  in  with billion of this growth in non interest and interest bearing demand and savings accounts 
this growth was partially a by product of prolonged weak economic conditions  as consumers reduced their investments in debt and equity securities while spending less and saving more 
the increase in deposits also resulted in a reduction in wholesale funding 
the increase in deposits and the resulting changes in its funding mix had a positive impact on net interest margin  in addition to an improvement in the corporation s market share throughout its five state footprint 
in addition  the corporation was able to position itself to assist creditworthy borrowers in the event of more robust consumer spending and business expansion in growth in non interest income and tight expense control enabled the corporation to enhance its net income growth  despite the significant credit quality challenges faced in the growth in non interest income in was mostly attributable to increases in gains on sales of mortgage loans  which were driven by historically low interest rates and federal government first time homebuyer incentives 
continued growth in non interest income in may be impacted by residential mortgage interest rates  which have a direct impact on the level of mortgage sale gains  and legislative activity  which will affect the fees that can be charged to customers for services such as overdrafts 
despite the challenging economic environment  the corporation was able to effectively manage its non interest expenses 
excluding the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in  the corporation was able to keep non interest expenses essentially flat in comparison to the prior year 
reductions in discretionary spending and a decrease in charges for losses on auction rate securities offset increases in fdic insurance assessments and expenses related to the collection and workout of problem loans 
credit quality presented the greatest challenge to the corporation in the provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for the significant increase in the provision for loan losses was related to the increase in non performing loans and net charge offs  which required additions to the allowance for credit losses to meet allocation needs 
the 
table of contents corporation began to see stabilization in credit quality metrics during the second half of  as the rate of increase in non performing assets slowed 
as a result  provisioning levels were reduced slightly during the second half of the year 
while there is still much uncertainty about the economic outlook and the potential effects on credit quality in  the corporation believes that it took the appropriate steps to manage its exposures as of december  and continues to actively monitor its portfolio for signs of further deterioration 
the corporation has maintained strong capital and liquidity positions throughout despite the challenges faced in  the corporation has the potential for future earnings growth in the event of an economic rebound 
the timing and extent of a recovery will depend largely on customers confidence in the economy  which will strengthen demand for loans and other products and services the corporation offers 
summary financial results the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes

construction loans decreased million  or  due to efforts by the corporation to reduce credit exposure in this sector  particularly in its maryland and virginia markets 
also contributing to the decrease were million in construction loan charge offs during home equity loans decreased million  or  and residential mortgages decreased million  or  both due to refinance activity generated by low interest rates 
offsetting these decreases was a million  or  increase in commercial mortgages  of which million was attributable to increases in commercial mortgages generated in the corporation s pennsylvania market  and a million  or  increase in commercial loans 
approximately billion  or  of the corporation s loan portfolio was in commercial mortgage and construction loans as of december  the corporation does not have a concentration of credit risk with any single borrower  industry or geographical location 
the performance of real estate markets and general economic conditions adversely impacted the performance of these loans throughout  most significantly construction loans to residential housing developers in the corporation s maryland and virginia markets

in addition  the corporation invested the funds received from the issuance of preferred stock to the united states treasury department in december finally  increases in investments were also due to the purchase of million of arcs from customers during the corporation classified of its investment portfolio as available for sale as of december  and  as such  these investments were recorded at their estimated fair values 
the net unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities at december  was million  compared to a net unrealized loss of million as of december   as a result of the decrease in market interest rates on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities in other assets cash and due from banks decreased million  or 
because of the daily fluctuations that result in the normal course of business  cash is more appropriately analyzed in terms of average balances 
on an average balance basis for the month of december  cash and due from banks increased million  or  from million in to million in other earning assets decreased million  or  primarily due to a million  or  decrease in loans held for sale 
premises and equipment increased million  or  to million 
the increase reflects additions primarily for the construction of new branch facilities  offset by depreciation and the sales of branch and office facilities during goodwill and intangible assets decreased million  or  due to the amortization of intangible assets

the increase in demand and savings accounts was in personal  business and  to a lesser degree  governmental accounts 
the increase in personal accounts was primarily due to a reduction in consumer spending  in addition to the impact of decreased consumer confidence in equity and debt markets  both as a result of weak economic conditions 
the increase in business and governmental accounts was due  in part  to businesses transferring funds from the corporation s cash management products due to low interest rates 
the increase in time deposits resulted from a million  or  increase in customer certificates of deposit  offset by a million  or 
table of contents  decrease in brokered certificates of deposit 
the increase in customer certificates of deposit was due to active promotion in the beginning of short term borrowings decreased million  or  primarily in federal funds purchased million decrease and short term customer funding million decrease 
federal funds purchased declined as a result of deposit growth  while short term customer funding decreased as customers transferred funds from the cash management program to deposits due to the low interest rate environment 
long term debt decreased million  or  as a result of the maturity of fhlb advances 
other liabilities other liabilities decreased million  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in dividends payable to common shareholders  as the quarterly dividend rate was per share in the fourth quarter of and per share in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the decrease was an million reduction in financial guarantee liabilities related to commitments to purchase arcs from customers  a million decrease in amounts payable for security purchases executed prior to year end  but not settled until after year end and a million decrease in accrued interest payable 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in equity commitments payable on lih investments 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion  or of total assets as of december  the increase was due to million of net income  a million increase in net holding gains on investment securities  million of stock issuances and a million increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement plan costs  offset by million of dividends on common and preferred shares outstanding 
on december   the corporation entered into a securities purchase agreement with the us treasury department ust pursuant to which the corporation sold to the ust  for an aggregate purchase price of million   shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a preferred stock  par value  per share  and warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock  par value per share 
as a condition under the cpp  without the consent of the ust  the corporation s share repurchases are limited to purchases in connection with the administration of any employee benefit plan  including purchases to offset share dilution in connection with any such plans 
this restriction is effective until december or until the ust no longer owns any of the corporation s preferred shares issued under the cpp 
the corporation s preferred stock is included as a component of tier capital in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
the preferred stock ranks senior to the corporation s common shares and pays a compounding cumulative dividend at a rate of per year for the first five years  and per year thereafter 
dividends are payable quarterly on february th  may th  august th and november th 
the corporation is prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of common stock or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of the corporation s common shares in any quarter unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on the preferred stock for all past dividend periods including the latest completed dividend period  subject to certain limited exceptions 
in addition  without the consent of the ust  the corporation is prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividends on common shares in excess of per share  which was the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  the corporation is also restricted in the amounts and types of compensation it may pay to certain executives as a result of its participation in the cpp 
the preferred stock is non voting  other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the preferred stock 
the ust may transfer the preferred stock to a third party at any time 
the million of common stock warrants issued to the ust have a term of years and are exercisable at any time  in whole or in part  at an exercise price of per share subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the million of proceeds was allocated to the preferred stock and the warrants based on their relative fair values at issuance million was allocated to the preferred stock and million to the warrants 
the difference between the initial value allocated to the preferred stock of approximately million and the liquidation value of million will be charged to retained earnings over the first five years of the contract as an adjustment to the dividend yield using the effective yield method 
during  total accretion of the difference between the preferred stock s initial value and its liquidation value was million 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december 
table of contents   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  all of the corporation s bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
fair value measurements the disclosure of fair value measurements is required by fasb asc topic  which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three categories from highest to lowest priority level inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  or quoted prices for identical instruments in non active markets 
also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or other market corroborated means 
level inputs that are largely unobservable  as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued 
the corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels 
see note p  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by fasb asc topic the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities categorized as level items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management s judgment 
the need for greater management judgment in determining fair values for level assets and liabilities has further been heightened by the current challenging economic conditions  which have resulted in significant volatility in the fair values of certain investment securities 
the corporation engages third party valuation experts to assist in valuing most available for sale investment securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are classified as level or level items 
the pricing data and market quotes the corporation obtains from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charges to expense  through the provision for loan losses  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on the corporation s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  the estimated fair value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions  among other considerations 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are adequate as of the balance sheet date  however  future changes to the allowance or reserve may be necessary based on changes in any of these factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two components specific allowances allocated to individually impaired loans  as required by fasb asc section  and allowances calculated for pools of loans under fasb asc subtopic impaired loans represent loans for which the corporation believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the corporation uses an internal risk rating process for its commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans consisting of nine general classifications ranging from excellent to loss 
internal credit ratings are reviewed in connection with the corporation s ongoing allowance allocation process 
larger balance commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans with risk ratings of substandard or lower are individually reviewed for impairment under fasb asc section a loan with a substandard credit rating is inadequately protected by sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the collateral pledged  if any 
in addition  there exists a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the normal repayment of the debt 
collection of principal may be collateral intensive 
a distinct possibility exists that some loss may be sustained if deficiencies are not corrected 
loans that are determined to be impaired are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the fair value of collateral is generally based on appraisals  discounted to represent expected sale prices 
an allowance for loan losses is allocated to an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  a reserve for unfunded lending commitments is allocated for impaired loans with unused commitments to extend credit 

table of contents all loans not individually reviewed for impairment under fasb asc section are evaluated under fasb asc subtopic loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors  such as recent loss history  and qualitative factors  such as economic conditions and trends 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages and home equity loans  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
large balance commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans with internal credit ratings of satisfactory minus or special mention are also evaluated under fasb asc subtopic since these loans have somewhat higher risk characteristics compared to other loans evaluated under fasb asc subtopic  they are segregated into separate pools for evaluation purposes 
loans rated special mention represent potentially weak loans or assets presenting an unwarranted credit risk  but less risky than substandard assets 
loans rated satisfactory minus generally involve borrowers that may lack experience  depth or credit history 
borrowers may display marginal financial condition and financial trends that are unestablished or may be negative  however  the corporation has an optimistic view of their future collectibility 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the corporation considers risk factors such as local and national economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  the diversity of borrower industry types  and the composition of the portfolio by loan type 
an unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable  and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
loans and lease financing receivables deemed to be a loss are written off through a charge against the allowance for credit losses 
closed end consumer loans are generally charged off when they become days past due days for open end consumer loans if they are not adequately secured by real estate 
all other loans are evaluated for possible charge off when it is probable that the balance will not be collected  based on the ability of the borrower to pay and the value of the underlying collateral 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are recorded as increases to the allowance for loan losses 
past due status is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments 
prior to  loans reviewed for impairment under fasb asc section also included large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages that were rated satisfactory minus or special mention 
in  the corporation revised its allocation methodology to evaluate loans with these internal risk ratings under fasb asc subtopic  as documented above 
the methodology was changed to more properly align internal risk ratings with the likelihood of impairment 
this change in allocation methodology did not result in a change in the corporation s overall allowance for credit losses balance  or in a change to the unallocated allowance  but rather resulted in a re categorization of the allowance for loan losses from the allowance allocated to impaired loans under fasb asc section to the allowance allocated to loans evaluated under fasb asc subtopic this change in methodology did result in a significant decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments  which is based solely on unfunded commitments related to impaired loans 
such loans included satisfactory minus and special mention loans in years prior to as of december   the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was  as compared to million as of december  lease financing receivables include both open and closed end leases for the purchase of vehicles and equipment 
residual values are set at the inception of the lease and are reviewed periodically for impairment 
if the impairment is considered to be other than temporary  the resulting reduction in the net investment in the lease is recognized as a loss in the period when impairment occurs 
business combinations and intangible assets the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including certain intangible assets that must be recognized 
typically  this allocation results in the purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired  which is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
in  the corporation recorded a million goodwill impairment charge due to one of its defined reporting units failing the annual impairment test and based on the additional valuation procedures performed 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
table of contents in for additional details related to the corporation s goodwill impairment test  see note f  goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reporting unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an interim impairment test is required 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recognition and measurement of tax positions is based on management s evaluations of relevant tax code and appropriate industry information about audit proceedings for comparable positions at other organizations 
virtually all of the corporation s unrecognized tax benefits are for positions that are taken on an annual basis on state tax returns 
increases to unrecognized tax benefits will occur as a result of accruing for the nonrecognition of the position for the current year 
decreases will occur as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations for the oldest outstanding year which includes the position

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  debt security market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk  debt security market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s equity investments consisted of fhlb and federal reserve bank stock million  common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions million  and money market mutual funds and other equity investments million 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had an adjusted cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses in this portfolio were approximately million and million as of december   respectively 
the corporation has evaluated whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of million in  million in  and  in for financial institutions stocks which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
in  the corporation also recorded a  other than temporary impairment charge for a mutual fund investment 
in  the corporation recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and  for a mutual fund investment and other government agency sponsored stocks  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the issuers 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
another source of equity market price risk is the corporation s investment in fhlb stock  which the corporation is required to own in order to borrow funds from the fhlb 
fhlbs obtain funding primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligations of the federal home loan bank system 
the us government does not guarantee these obligations  and each of the fhlb banks is  generally  jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s debt 
the fhlb system has experienced financial stress  and some of the regional banks within the fhlb system have suspended or reduced their dividends  or eliminated the ability of members to redeem capital stock 
the corporation s fhlb stock and its ability to obtain fhlb funds could be adversely impacted if the financial health of the fhlb system worsens 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust and brokerage revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if the values of those investment portfolios decrease  whether due to factors influencing us securities markets in general  or otherwise  the corporation s revenue would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in equity markets 
debt security price risk debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt securities could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s debt securities consist primarily of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations whose principal payments are guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies  state and municipal securities  us government sponsored and us government debt securities  auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities 
the corporation s investments in auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities have significant debt security price risk 
auction rate certificates as of december   the corporation s investments in student loan auction rate securities  also known as auction rate certificates arcs  had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million  or of total assets 

table of contents arcs are long term securities structured to allow their sale in periodic auctions  resulting in both the treatment of arcs as short term instruments in normal market conditions and fair values that could be derived based on periodic auction prices 
however  beginning in  market auctions for these securities began to fail due to an insufficient number of buyers  resulting in an illiquid market 
this illiquidity has resulted in recent market prices that represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for fair value 
therefore  as of december   the fair value of the arcs held by the corporation were derived using significant unobservable inputs based on an expected cash flow model which produced fair values which were materially different from those that would be expected from settlement of these investments in the illiquid market that presently exists 
the expected cash flow model produced fair values which assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next three years 
the credit quality of the underlying debt associated with the arcs is also a factor in the determination of their estimated fair value 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the arcs held by the corporation were rated above investment grade  with approximately million  or  aaa rated by at least one ratings agency 
approximately million  or  of arcs were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency 
of this amount  approximately million  or  of the student loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
in total  approximately million  or  of the student loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
at december   all arcs held by the corporation were current and making schedule interest payments 
therefore the risk of changes in the estimated fair values of arcs due to deterioration in the credit quality of their underlying debt is not significant 
corporate debt securities the corporation holds corporate debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  single issuer trust preferred securities and subordinated debt issued by financial institutions  as presented in the following table december  amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands single issuer trust preferred securities subordinated debt pooled trust preferred securities total corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions historically  the corporation determined the fair value of these securities based on prices received from third party brokers and pricing agencies who determined fair values using both quoted prices for similar assets  when available  and model based valuation techniques that derived fair value based on market corroborated data  such as instruments with similar prepayment speeds and default interest rates 
the fair values for pooled trust preferred securities and certain single issuer trust preferred securities were based on quotes provided by third party brokers who determined fair values based predominantly on internal valuation models which were not indicative prices or binding offers 
the corporation s investments in single issuer trust preferred securities had an unrealized loss of million as of december  the corporation held single issuer trust preferred securities that were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  the majority of the single issuer trust preferred securities rated below investment grade were rated bb or baa 
single issuer trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december   were not rated by any ratings agency and  due to inactive or limited trading activity  were classified as level assets under fasb asc topic in april  the fasb issued staff position no 
and  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp fas 
fsp fas  codified within fasb asc subtopic  amends other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands disclosure requirements for other than temporarily impaired debt and equity securities 

table of contents in  the corporation recorded million of other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions 
these other than temporary impairment charges were based on the credit losses  as determined through present value modeling of expected cash flows 
in addition  in  the corporation recorded million million  net of tax of non credit related write downs to fair value as a component of other comprehensive loss 
during  the corporation recorded other than temporary impairment charges for pooled trust preferred securities totaling million 
upon adoption of fsp fas  the corporation determined that million of those other than temporary impairment charges were non credit related 
as such  a million net of million of taxes increase to retained earnings and a corresponding decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income was recorded as the cumulative effect of adopting fsp fas as of january  because previously recognized other than temporary impairment charges were reversed through equity rather than earnings  million of the million other than temporary impairment charges for certain pooled trust preferred securities recorded during were also presented as other than temporary impairment charges on the corporation s statements of operations for the year ended december  as noted above  the corporation has recorded significant other than temporary impairment charges related to its investments in pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions in and as of december   the corporation held ten pooled trust preferred securities 
nine of these securities  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million  were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with ratings ranging from c to caa 
for each of the nine pooled trust preferred securities held by the corporation  the class of securities held is below the most senior tranche  with the corporation s interests being subordinate to other investors in the pool 
the amortized cost of pooled trust preferred securities is the purchase price of the securities  net of credit related other than temporary impairment charges  determined using an expected cash flows analysis 
the most significant input to the expected cash flows model was the expected payment deferral rate for each pooled trust preferred security 
the corporation evaluates the financial metrics  such as capital ratios and non performing asset ratios  of the individual financial institution issuers that comprises each pooled trust preferred security to estimate its expected deferral rate 
the actual weighted average cumulative defaults and deferrals as a percentage of original collateral were approximately as of december  the expected weighted average deferral rate assumed in the discounted cash flow modeling for pooled trust preferred securities held by the corporation as of december  was approximately 
additional impairment charges for corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions may be necessary in the future depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation

interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a periodic basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term and long term needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide details related to the corporation s sources and uses of cash 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income  as adjusted for non cash charges such as the provision for loan losses 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in due to the purchase of 
table of contents investment securities exceeding the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
financing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in  primarily due to increases in deposits exceeding net repayments of short and long term borrowings and dividends on common and preferred stock 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings  if necessary 
management regularly monitors the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
as of december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december

maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
maturities of auction rate securities are based on contractual maturities 
see note o  commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to auction rate securities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
fair market value adjustments related to acquisitions are not included in the preceding table 
included within the billion of floating rate loans above are billion of loans  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily the london interbank offering rate libor  and billion  or  of adjustable rate loans 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 

table of contents the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  stratified by their remaining fixed term at december  fixed rate term percent of total adjustable rate loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rate relationships 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations includes the effect of expected cash flows 
expected prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
as of december   the cumulative six month ratio of rsa rsl was 
simulation of net interest income and net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock in interest rates  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current level of interest rates  the and basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million because certain current short term interest rates are at or below  the basis point downward shock assumes that corresponding short term interest rates approach an implied floor that  in effect  reflects a decrease of less than the full basis point downward shock 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
