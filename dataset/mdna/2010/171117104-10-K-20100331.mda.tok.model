item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is experiencing reduced demand for furniture as a result of weak consumer confidence and housing activity and the effects of the economic downturn 
additionally  sales were lower in due to the discontinuation of certain low margin products and the globalization of the furniture industry 
we expect that the current economic environment for consumers will continue to be challenging in we have repositioned our residential furniture product line in an effort to improve profitability by introducing better value imports  utilizing a product licensing arrangement for marketing support  and replacing unprofitable and slow moving items offered in our line with higher velocity items to improve customer service 
we have moved away from a high cost manufacturing model to global sourcing with lower costs 
we continue to review and cut operating costs to be in line with our current revenue base as the company completes its business transition 
the company s new business model is expected to result in a more variable cost structure and provide greater flexibility in competing in the furniture industry 

table of contents a prolonged economic downturn could cause outcomes to differ materially from those expected above 
results of operations the table below sets forth the results of operations of chromcraft revington for the years ended december  and expressed as a percentage of sales sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest expense  net loss before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense net loss compared to consolidated sales in were  a decrease from sales of  in residential furniture shipments in were lower than primarily due to weak consumer confidence and housing activity reflecting the effects of the economic downturn  restructuring activities including the elimination of slow moving and unprofitable products  reduction of customer accounts  and import competition 
commercial furniture shipments were lower in as compared to the prior year primarily due to industry wide reduced spending on contract and institutional projects attributable to the recessionary environment 
the consolidated sales decrease for was primarily due to lower unit volume principally in higher priced solid wood furniture product lines that were discontinued 
gross margin in was  as compared to  in reflecting our transition to a more variable cost global sourcing model 
the lower gross margin in was primarily due to asset impairments  unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  restructuring costs and inventory write downs 
restructuring and asset impairment costs  excluding inventory write downs  charged to gross margin for were  compared to  in restructuring and impairment costs were incurred for the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of distribution facilities 
total inventory write downs in declined to  compared to  in inventory write downs were recorded to reflect anticipated net realizable value on disposition 
the inventory write downs were primarily due to slow moving and unprofitable products and excess inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased  or from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to a decrease in compensation related expenses  severance costs  sales commissions and other selling related costs 
compensation and selling related expenses decreased in primarily due to restructuring activities 

table of contents net interest expense for was  as compared to  in net interest expense for was lower than the prior year primarily due to borrowings under our bank revolving loan facility in  which began in the third quarter of there were no borrowings under our bank revolving credit facility in the income tax benefit in of  reflects the impact of a new federal law enacted on november  that significantly expanded the availability of the five year net operating loss nol carryback opportunity enacted earlier in as part of the federal stimulus bill 
the new legislation allows companies of all sizes to carry back nols incurred in or to the previous five years 
this carryback can offset all of a taxpayer s taxable income in the first four taxable years  and percent of the taxable income in the fifth carryback year 
as a result of this legislation  we filed a carryback return of our federal nol and recorded a tax benefit of  the tax refund was received in the first quarter of at december  and  we established a full valuation allowance against the entire net deferred income tax balance after considering relevant factors  including recent operating results  the likelihood of the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards  and the ability to generate future taxable income 
in  we filed our federal income tax return and determined that the refundable portion of its tax loss should be reduced by  and characterized as an nol carryforward 
as a result  the company recorded income tax expense of  in to increase its valuation allowance on deferred income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities generated  of cash in as compared to  of cash used in the increase in cash in was primarily due to a reduction in working capital 
working capital  excluding cash and refundable income taxes  decreased  in to  from  at december  inventory reductions provided  in cash in primarily attributable to a reduction of slow moving and unprofitable products 
investing activities generated cash of  for as compared to  of cash generated in investing activities include cash received from the sale of assets from restructuring activities of  in compared to  in the proceeds from the sale of assets in included the sale of two buildings and idle machinery and equipment 
the company used cash of  for capital expenditures during  as compared to  spent in the prior year 
in  we expect to spend approximately  for capital expenditures 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and approximately  in availability under a revolving credit facility with a bank bank facility based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
there were no borrowings during or an outstanding balance at december  under the bank facility 
the bank facility expires in and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
certain covenants and restrictions  including a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement  will become effective if availability under the bank facility is less than  the company did not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio at december   however  the company s availability under the bank facility exceeded  at december  and  accordingly  the covenant regarding this ratio did not apply at the end of the company expects to have availability under the bank facility in excess of  during 
table of contents our ability to borrow under the bank facility is dependent upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as well as compliance with the terms of the bank facility 
while we expect to comply with the bank facility  in the event that we are in default  the bank could declare all obligations then outstanding to be immediately due  terminate the bank facility extended to the company and take certain other actions as a secured creditor  which could adversely affect our liquidity and business 
among the provisions of the bank facility that the bank may consider in determining if we are in default is whether any change in the company s condition could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business  operations  condition financial or otherwise or prospects or the value of any material collateral  or whether any event or circumstance impairs our ability to repay any obligations owed under the bank facility 
if a default occurs  we could attempt to obtain a waiver from the bank  but there is no assurance that the bank would grant such a waiver 
on november   a new federal law was enacted that significantly expanded the availability of the five year net operating loss nol carryback opportunity enacted earlier in as part of the federal stimulus bill 
the new legislation allows companies of all sizes to carry back nols incurred in or to the previous five years 
this carryback can offset all of a taxpayer s taxable income in the first four taxable years  and percent of the taxable income in the fifth carryback year 
as a result of this legislation  the company filed a carryback return of its federal nol and recorded a tax benefit of  the tax refund was received in the first quarter of we believe that our cash  including the tax refund of approximately  and availability under our bank facility will be adequate to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we have implemented expense controls and limitations on capital expenditures to conserve cash during the current economic downturn 
we will need to generate cash flow from operations in future periods in order to meet our long term liquidity needs 
in the absence of adequate cash flow from operations in the future  the company may need to further restrict expenditures  sell assets  or seek additional business funding 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the company requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related footnotes 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of trade receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on our analysis of customer credit worthiness  historical loss experience and general economic conditions and trends 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventories for excess or slow moving items based on sales order activity and expected market changes 
if circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceeds their recoverable value  inventories are reduced to net realizable value 
employee related benefits accounting for self insured health care and workers compensation liabilities involves assumptions of expected claims based on past experience and a review of individual claims 
we establish a liability based on claim information supplied by insurance and third party administrators 
actual claim expense could differ from the estimates made by the company 
property  plant and equipment we review long lived assets for impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate the possibility that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
factors that may trigger an impairment evaluation include under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the forecast of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
if a possible impairment is identified  the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and include net operating loss tax carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we review relevant factors  including recent operating results  the likelihood of the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards and the ability to generate future taxable income to determine if deferred income taxes are recoverable and if a valuation reserve is required 
the company adopted authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january   and determined that no adjustment was required to retained earnings due to the adoption of this interpretation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements
