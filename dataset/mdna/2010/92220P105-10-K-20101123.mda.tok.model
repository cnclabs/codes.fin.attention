item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased from fiscal year operating earnings  as a percentage of revenues  increased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year 
reflecting weak net orders in fiscal year  total revenues from continuing operations grew in fiscal year over fiscal year demand for new products  particularly our truebeam tm systems in oncology systems and our radiographic flat panels in x ray products  drove net order growth 
net orders increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  which included a now cancelled million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken 
excluding the proton system order  net orders in fiscal year grew over fiscal year backlog at the end of fiscal year was higher than at the end of the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we used million to repurchase million shares of vms common stock 
in fiscal year  we believe we successfully navigated within a tough environment and  by the end of the fiscal year  there is greater clarity on the uncertainties created by the economic downturn on hospital budgets  the healthcare reform in the united states and  for fiscal year  the reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery at free standing clinics in the united states 
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we classified research instruments as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of earnings 
including a loss from these discontinued operations  net earnings in fiscal year were per diluted share 
research instruments was previously included in the other category 
unless otherwise stated  the discussion in this md a pertains to our continuing operations 
oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which designs  manufacturers  sells and services hardware and software products for radiation treatment of cancer with conventional radiotherapy  imrt  igrt  vmat an advanced form of imrt  stereotactic radiotherapy  stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we introduced the truebeam system for image guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery 
this product line is a fully integrated system designed from the ground up to treat a moving target with higher speed and accuracy 
including a small portion of truebeam orders representing upgrades from other linear accelerators already in our backlog  through october   we had received orders for more than truebeam systems since its introduction  a majority of which came from north america 
we believe truebeam will be a valuable tool for clinicians in the fight against cancer and we expect it will stimulate stronger demand for our surgical products  as well as faster replacement of older systems in our installed base 
our ability to successfully introduce and commercialize new product lines  such as truebeam  without disrupting the ongoing demand for our existing product lines is important and failure to do so may have a negative impact on revenues and net earnings 
oncology systems net orders increased  or on a constant currency basis  in fiscal year over fiscal year with growth from both the international and north american regions 
increased demand for our linear accelerators driven by demand for the new truebeam system and  to a lesser extent  the unique low energy linear accelerator and our software products contributed to the growth in total oncology systems net orders  as did continued growth in demand for our service contracts 
as of fiscal year end  oncology systems had reported three consecutive quarters of double digit net order growth worldwide and two consecutive quarters of double digit net order growth in north america over the year earlier periods 
continuing growth in demand for our oncology systems products depend in part on the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery in the united states 
following weak north american net orders in fiscal year  oncology systems recorded an decrease in north american revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year but a increase in international revenues 
oncology systems total revenues rose in the aggregate primarily because of continued growth in service contract revenues 
oncology systems gross margin in fiscal year 
table of contents improved from fiscal year as an increase in service contract gross margin more than offset a decrease in product gross margin 
x ray products 
our x ray products business segment  designs  manufactures and sells i x ray tubes for use in a range of applications including ct scanning  radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures and industrial applications  and ii flat panel detectors for filmless x ray imaging 
in fiscal year  x ray products reported record net orders  revenues and operating earnings 
net orders and revenues increased and  respectively  in fiscal year over fiscal year  reflecting a recovery in the global imaging equipment industry 
both the flat panel including the radiographic flat panels and the x ray tube product lines contributed to the increase in net orders and revenues 
x ray products gross margin improved in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to a product mix shift towards a higher proportion of higher margin products and higher sales volume 
our success in our x ray products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets  the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers 
in addition  changes in access to diagnostic radiology or the reimbursement rates associated with diagnostic radiology as a result of the affordable health care for america act and similar state proposals will likely affect demand for our products 
other 
the other category is comprised of i sip  which designs  manufactures  sells and services linatron x ray accelerators  imaging processing software and image detection products including intellx tm for security and inspection  ii our varian particle therapy business  which designs  develops  manufactures  sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy treatments  and iii the operations of the gtc  our scientific research facility 
net orders in the other category declined in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily because we recorded the now cancelled million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken in the prior fiscal year  and to a lesser extent  because of a decrease in sip net orders as this business was negatively impacted by bid award challenges among competitors for a large government project in north america 
total revenues in the other category increased primarily due to an increase in service revenues from varian particle therapy related to the commissioning of a proton therapy system  partially offset by a decrease in sip revenues 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under item a  risk factors 
we discuss our results of operations below 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies  estimates and assumptions and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  share based compensation expense  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of warranty obligations  assessment of environmental remediation liabilities  valuation of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans  valuation of derivative instruments and taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies require us to use judgments  
table of contents often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  see item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year  we elected to early adopt the amended software revenue guidance and amended multiple deliverable revenue arrangement guidance on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal year and have applied the amended guidance for revenue arrangements originating or materially modified after october  under the amended guidance  the allocation of consideration in a multiple element arrangement is affected by the determination of whether any software deliverables that function together with other hardware components to deliver the hardware products essential functionality is considered as non software products for purpose of revenue recognition 
the allocation of consideration to each non software deliverable is based on the assumptions we use to establish its selling price  which are based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence of selling price  if it exists  and if not on estimated selling prices 
in addition  the allocation of consideration to each software deliverable in a multiple element arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether vsoe of its fair value exists in these arrangements 
under the prior authoritative guidance  the allocation of consideration to each deliverable in a multiple deliverable arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for hardware deliverables and vsoe of the fair value existed for software deliverables in these arrangements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the amounts allocated to each element could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  revenues related to certain proton therapy commissioning service contracts and highly customized image detection systems are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed  based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract 
because the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the dollar amounts to relevant accounting periods  and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted  if our estimates prove to be inaccurate or circumstances change over time  we may be forced to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss in later periods 
if a loss is expected on a contract under the percentage of completion method or completed contract method  the estimated loss would be charged to cost of sales in the period the loss is identified 
share based compensation expense we value our stock options granted and the option component of the shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by vms s stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions  including the expected term of stock awards and the expected price volatility of vms stock over the expected term of the awards 

table of contents the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and post vesting cancellations of stock options by our employees 
we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility 
we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
blended volatility represents the weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 
implied volatility is derived based on traded options on vms common stock 
implied volatility is weighted in the calculation of blended volatility based on the ratio of the term of the exchange traded options to the expected terms of the employee stock options 
historical volatility represents the remainder of the weighting 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options on vms common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of use of implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
after considering the above factors  we determined that we could not rely exclusively on implied volatility based on the fact that the term of vms exchange traded options is less than one year and that it is different from the expected terms of the stock options we grant 
therefore  we believe a combination of the historical volatility over the expected terms of the stock options we grant and the implied volatility of exchange traded options best reflects the expected volatility of vms common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions 
except for government tenders  group purchases and orders with letters of credit in oncology systems  sip and varian particle therapy  and orders in our x ray products business  our payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due when the customer signs the purchase order  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss to the customer and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that are highly specialized in nature and that are subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of 
table of contents businesses that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  we have typically allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to these intangibles or to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
the allocation of the purchase price from business acquisitions to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
should conditions differ from management s estimates at the time of the acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  if any  consists of a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the most recent annual goodwill impairment testing that we performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for each of our four reporting units with goodwill oncology systems  x ray products  sip and varian particle therapy  the fair value of each such reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
warranty obligations we warrant most of our products for a specific period of time  usually twelve months  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends  if required 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty costs in the future  it would have a negative effect on our operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world 
those laws regulate multiple aspects of our operations  including the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous substances 
they impose costs on our operations and in connection with past operations 
in connection with past operations  we record environmental remediation liabilities when we conclude that environmental assessments or remediation efforts are probable and we believe we can reasonably estimate the costs of those efforts 
our accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate of the total costs of assessments and remediation and the time period over which we expect to incur those costs 
we review 
table of contents these accrued balances quarterly 
were we required to increase or decrease the accrued environmental costs in the future  it would adversely or favorably impact our operating results 
defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor five defined benefit pension plans in germany  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements in these countries 
in july  we made changes to the defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom by terminating the accrual of additional benefits for existing participants and suspending the enrollment of new participants 
although we do not have any defined benefit pension plans in the united states  we sponsor a post retirement benefit plan that provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible retirees 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefits are actuarially determined  such as our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and rate of healthcare cost increases  all of which we determine within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expenses and liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience particularly in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plan expense we record 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return on those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based primarily on the yields of a universe of high quality corporate bonds in each country or the spot rate of high quality aa rated corporate bonds  with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
in countries where the corporate bond market is not sufficiently representative of the time period at longer durations  the discount rate also takes into account the yield of long term government bonds corresponding to the duration of the benefit obligations and the difference between the yield curve on high quality corporate fixed income investments and government fixed income investments 
a change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction 
valuation of derivative instruments we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies and on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivative instruments and are measured at fair value 
asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are calculated primarily using level inputs  which include currency spot and forward rates  interest rate and credit or non performance risk 
the spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date and sourced from our major trading banks 
the forward point values for each currency and the london interbank offered rate libor to discount assets and liabilities are interpolated from commonly quoted broker services 
one year credit default swap spreads of the counterparty at the measurement date are used to adjust derivative assets  all of which mature in less than months  for non performance risk 
we are required to adjust derivative liabilities to reflect the potential non performance risk to lenders based on our incremental borrowing rate 
each contract is individually adjusted using the counterparty for net asset or our discount rate for net liability 
the use of level inputs in determining fair values requires certain management judgment and subjectivity 
changes to these level inputs could have a material impact to the valuation of our derivative instruments  as well as on our result of operations 

table of contents taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes contain a two step approach to recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
recognition  derecognition and measurement are based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the end of the accounting period 
a tax benefit should be recognized in the first period in which it meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  and conversely  a tax benefit previously recognized should be derecognized in the first period in which new information results in a change in judgment in which the position fails to meet the recognition threshold 
a benefit not previously recognized would be recognized when the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation with tax authorities  or when the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on earnings 
generally  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in the applicable tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions  we would increase our valuation allowance and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 
earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
our effective tax rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries do business 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international regions  or a change in the mix of international regions among particular tax jurisdictions  could increase our effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on certain undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states

in fiscal year  growth in oncology systems and x ray products product revenues over fiscal year was partially offset by a decline in sip product revenue 
product revenues grew more slowly from fiscal year to fiscal year as compared to fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily because of the decrease in oncology systems product revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year oncology systems service contracts revenues were the primary contributor to the growth in service contracts and other revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal year over fiscal year  although  to a lesser extent  varian particle therapy and sip also contributed to the increases in service contracts and other revenues 
service contracts and other revenues grew faster in fiscal year over compared to fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to the faster growth in oncology systems service contract revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year north american revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year as the decline in north american revenues from oncology systems and sip more than offset the increase in x ray products north american revenues

oncology systems product revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased revenues from sales of our linear accelerators  partially offset by increased revenues from sales of our brachytherapy products 
for fiscal year  the increase in oncology systems product revenues over fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in revenues from sales of our software products 
the increases in service contract revenues  in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal year over fiscal year were primarily driven by increased customer adoption of service contracts as our products become more sophisticated and by increased number of customers as the installed base of our products continues to grow 
since service contract revenues grew faster than product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year and from fiscal year to fiscal year  service contract revenues also increased as a percentage of total oncology systems revenues in each year

due to decreases in sales in most product lines  north american oncology systems product revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year  although the decrease was partially offset by increased service contract revenues 
in fiscal year  the increase in north american oncology systems revenues over fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in revenues from sales of our software products and our linear accelerators  as well as an increase in service contract revenues 
varying cycles of higher and lower revenues between the international and north american regions is a historical pattern reflecting regional influences such as effects of the recession  uncertainty created by healthcare reform and reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the united states  and different technology adoption cycles that are consistent with the net order patterns discussed more fully under net orders

research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change research and development as a percentage of total revenues 
table of contents the million increase in research and development expense for fiscal year over fiscal year was driven by increased expenses of million in the other category  million in oncology systems and million in x ray products 
the million increase in the other category was primarily due to an increase in labor expenses  material costs and consulting expenses for research and development projects in varian particle therapy and sip 
the million increase in oncology systems was primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact when foreign currency denominated research and development expenses for oncology systems were translated into us dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  when the us dollar was relatively stronger against foreign currencies 
the million increase in x ray products was mainly due to higher development expenses for x ray tube products 
the million increase in research and development expense for fiscal year over fiscal year was driven by increased expenses of million in oncology systems  million in the other category and million in x ray products 
the million increase in oncology systems was primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount  material costs and consulting expenses for product development  although these expenses were partially offset by a million favorable impact  when foreign currency denominated research and development expenses for oncology systems were translated into us dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year when the us dollar was relatively weaker against foreign currencies 
the million increase in the other category was primarily due to higher expense for development projects in varian particle therapy and sip 
the million increase in x ray products was mainly for development projects for both x ray tubes and flat panel products

as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased one percentage point from fiscal year the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to a a million decrease in accruals for contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business  b a million net decrease in certain commission and product promotion expenses for our oncology systems products and c a million decrease in information technology expenses primarily due to the completion of the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system in the second quarter of fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by i a million increase in employee related costs primarily related to increased accrued bonuses  ii a million expense associated with reduction in force during fiscal year  iii a million decrease in net gain from hedging balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units  iv a million increase in insurance expenses and v an unfavorable impact of million when the foreign currency denominated selling  general and administrative expenses of our foreign operations were translated into us dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  when the us dollar was relatively stronger against foreign currencies 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to a a million increase in fees for certain commission arrangements and product promotions which were primarily tied to growth in oncology systems revenues  b a million increase in depreciation expenses for our enterprise resource planning system that was placed in service in the second quarter of fiscal year  c a million increase in accruals for contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business and d a million net increase in employee related costs that reflected increased headcount to support our growing business activities partially offset 
table of contents by a reduction in accrued bonuses and other cost control measures 
these items were partially offset by a favorable impact of million as the foreign currency denominated selling  general and administrative expenses of our foreign operations were translated into us dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  when the us dollar was relatively weaker against foreign currencies 
interest income  net fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income expense  net in fiscal year  the net increase in interest expense  net of interest income  over fiscal year was primarily due to the lower average interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
in fiscal year  the decrease in interest income  net of interest expense  over fiscal year was attributable to the lower average interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit from discrete items in fiscal year  including a smaller release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions  partially offset by an increase in the benefit from the foreign rate differential in fiscal year the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a net benefit from discrete items  primarily the release of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions  including the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions and the favorable resolution of several income tax audits  partially offset by a decrease in the benefit of the foreign tax rate differential 
in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are  on average  lower than the us federal rate  and our domestic earnings are subject to state income taxes 
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by having lower earnings than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  and by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws 
for example  recent proposals would make significant changes us taxation of us based multinational corporations 
although we cannot predict whether or in what form congress would enact any such proposals  legislation of this type could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
we also expect that our effective tax rate may experience increased fluctuation from period to period under the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes

net orders total net orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total net orders total net orders in fiscal year increased  or on a constant currency basis  from fiscal year which included the million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken as described further below 
net order increases from oncology systems and x ray products were partially offset by net order decreases from varian particle therapy and sip 
including the million proton therapy system order in varian particle therapy  total net orders for fiscal year increased  or on a constant currency basis  over fiscal year  with slight increases in oncology systems and x ray products net orders and a decline in sip net orders 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  to avoid potentially confusing comparisons created by large and variable orders for our varian particle therapy products  we will report orders by business rather than for the total company 
oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to a growth in fiscal year over fiscal year on a constant currency basis  oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems north american net orders increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  with growth in net orders in the second half of the fiscal year more than offsetting the net order decline in the first half of the fiscal year 
increased demand for our linear accelerators  driven by the new truebeam system  as well as increased demand for our service contracts  including software service agreements  were the primarily contributors to the oncology systems north american net order increase in fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems international net orders increased  or on a constant currency basis  in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to increased demand for our linear accelerators including the truebeam system and unique and our software products  in europe and asia  as well as growth in demand for our service contracts in all international regions 
the overall weaker us dollar against foreign currencies in fiscal year compared to fiscal year favorably impacted oncology systems international net orders when measured in us dollars 
for fiscal year  the growth in oncology systems international net orders over fiscal year was significantly offset by the net order decrease in north america as this region was impacted by the 
table of contents recession  the uncertainty created by the prospects of healthcare reform and uncertainty in late fiscal year about the then proposed reduction in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery at free standing clinics and for physician reimbursement for radiation oncology 
in north america  oncology systems experienced net order declines in most of its product lines in fiscal year over fiscal year while this region continued to experience growth in demand for service contracts 
all international regions contributed to the growth in international oncology systems net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year growth in our service contracts  as well as growth in demand for our software products in all international regions and our high energy linear accelerators in europe and asia  contributed to fiscal year growth in international oncology systems net orders over fiscal year the overall stronger us dollar against foreign currencies in fiscal year compared to fiscal year negatively impacted oncology systems international net orders when measured in us dollars 
when measured in constant currency  international oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year the trailing months growth in net orders for oncology systems for the three immediately prior fiscal quarters ends were a total increase  with a decrease in north america and an increase for the international region  as of july   flat for total net orders  with a decrease in north america and an increase for the international region  as of april   a total decrease  with an decrease in north america and an increase for the international region  as of january   consistent with the historical pattern  we expect that oncology systems net orders will continue to experience regional fluctuations 
x ray products net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year the growth in x ray products net orders in fiscal year was primarily due to increased demand for flat panel products  especially our radiographic flat panels  in north america  europe and asia  as well as increased demand for our x ray tubes products in asia 
in fiscal year  the increase in net orders over fiscal year for our flat panel detectors including our radiographic imaging panels was significantly offset by the decrease in net orders for x ray tubes 
net orders in the other category declined million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily because varian particle therapy booked the now cancelled million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken in fiscal year but did not book a proton therapy order in fiscal year sip also experienced a decrease in net orders in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as this business was negatively impacted by bid award challenges among competitors for a large government project in north america 
we booked the order from skandion kliniken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year when skandion kliniken awarded us a contract to deliver and install a proton therapy system in sweden following a public tender process  which was subsequently challenged by a competitor 
after the swedish court ruled in december that the tender should be recommenced  skandion kliniken cancelled the award with us in january in accordance with our order booking policy  we removed this order from our backlog in the first quarter of fiscal year in july  skandion kliniken announced the award of the re tender for its proton therapy facility to a competitor and we  along with another bidder  are currently challenging this award 
for our varian particle therapy business  we recognize orders when construction of the related proton therapy treatment center is reasonably expected to start within two years 
also  we only recognize orders for varian particle therapy products with contingencies if we deem the contingencies perfunctory or if we publicly disclose the existence and nature of material contingencies 
however  orders will not be recognized if there are major financing contingencies or customer board approval contingencies pending 
as the u 
s economy stabilizes and uncertainty regarding healthcare reform and reimbursement rates subsides  we could experience a temporary increase in orders due to pent up demand of customers  which in turn could increase the volatility of our orders and revenues 
orders in any period may not be directly correlated to the level of revenues in any particular future quarter or period since the timing of revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders  
table of contents acceptance schedules and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products 
moreover  certain types of orders  such as software products or newly introduced products in our oncology systems segment  typically take more time from order to completion of installation and acceptance than hardware or older products 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we approved a plan to sell research instruments to focus the business that we acquired from accel exclusively on the development of our varian particle therapy business 
the sale of research instruments was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year research instruments has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented 
research instruments was previously included in the other category 
in fiscal year  we recognized an additional loss of million for additional cost to settle one customer contract and estimated costs to complete and settle the other customer contract  both of which were related to the sale of research instruments 
these contracts had been accounted for under the percentage of completion method  under which revenues and costs of sales are adjusted to reflect changes in estimated costs to complete the contracts 
the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates 
if the estimated loss to complete or settle the remaining contract increases  the variance will be recognized in the periods these variances arise 
including the additional loss recognized for the two contracts  total losses of research instruments for fiscal year was million  less applicable income tax of zero 
loss reported in discontinued operations for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively  less applicable income tax of zero 
in fiscal year  loss in discontinued operations included a loss of million on the disposal of research instruments 
in fiscal year  loss from discontinued operations included goodwill impairment and impairment of long lived assets related to research instruments 
total revenues of research instruments  reported in discontinued operations  for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
see note  discontinued operations to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
backlog at october   our backlog including the cancellation of the million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken was billion  which is an increase of over the backlog at october  our oncology systems backlog at october  was higher than the backlog at october   which reflects a increase for the international regions and an increase for north america 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquire businesses  repurchase vms stock  and fund continuing operations 
our sources of cash have included operations  borrowings  stock option exercises and employee stock purchases although no purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were made during fiscal year and interest income 
our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
because research instruments cash flows were not material for any period presented  we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the discussion herein 
cash and cash equivalents the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents in millions october  october  decrease cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents our cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at october  to million at october  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year was due primarily to million used for the repurchase of vms common stock  million of capital expenditures  million used for an equity forward contract related to an accelerated vms common stock repurchase agreement  million used for the repayment of bank borrowings and million for tendered vms common stock used to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted common stock and restricted stock units 
these decreases were partially offset by million of cash generated from operating activities  million of cash provided by stock option exercises  million of cash provided by net borrowings under our credit facility and million of cash provided by the excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate changes in fiscal year increased cash and cash equivalents by million 
at october   we had approximately million or  of total cash and cash equivalents in the united states 
approximately million  or  of total cash and cash equivalents was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states 
as of october   most of our cash and cash equivalents that were held abroad were in us dollars and were primarily held as bank deposits 
because our cash levels in the united states are relatively low  we have used our credit facilities to meet our cash needs from time to time and expect to continue to do so in the future 
borrowings under our credit facilities may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
cash flows fiscal years in millions net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the million increase in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items  an increase in non cash items of million and an increase of million in net earnings 
the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were inventories and advance payments from customers as follows inventories increased by million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year in oncology systems  x ray products and varian particle therapy 
advance payments from customers increased by million due to increased orders  as well as receipt of a down payment for a proton therapy system not yet recognized in net orders as of the end of the third quarter 
the million decrease in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items and a decrease in non cash items of million  partially offset by an increase of million in net earnings 

table of contents the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were accounts receivable  inventories  other long term liabilities  accrued expenses and advance payments from customers as follows accounts receivable increased million due to higher revenues and an increase in dso from the end of fiscal year inventories increased by million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year in all of our businesses 
other long term liabilities decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in long term income taxes payable as a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions and the favorable resolution of several income tax audits 
accrued expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable 
advance payments from customers increased by million due to an increase in volume of our oncology systems service contracts 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  timing of product shipments and customer acceptance  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
see item a  risk factors 
investing activities used million of net cash in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year cash used for purchases of property  plant and equipment was million in fiscal year  compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we made an additional net loan advance of million to dpix 
in fiscal year  we also invested million in a privately held company 
financing activities used net cash of million in fiscal year compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we used million for the repurchases of common stock  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal years  and  we used million  million and million  respectively  to repay bank borrowings 
in fiscal year  we also used million for an equity forward contract related to an accelerated vms common stock repurchase agreement 
in fiscal year  we also used million to repay borrowings under our credit facilities 
cash used for financing activities in fiscal years  and also includes million  million and million the value of withheld shares  respectively  for tendered vms common stock to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted common stock and restricted stock units 
these uses were partially offset by cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of million  million and million in fiscal years  and respectively  as well as cash provided by excess tax benefits from share based compensation of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal years and  we also borrowed million and million  respectively  in net cash from our credit facilities 
we expect our capital expenditures  which typically represent construction and or purchases of facilities  manufacturing equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures  as well as capitalized costs related to the implementation of software applications  will be approximately of revenues in fiscal year we have a million credit facility with bank of america  na bofa  which was amended and restated in november and then again amended in july and in august this credit facility  as amended to date  is referred to as the amended bofa credit facility 
a portion of the amended bofa credit facility is collateralized with a pledge of stock of certain of vms s present and future 
table of contents subsidiaries that are deemed to be material subsidiaries 
as of october   vms has pledged to bofa of the voting shares that it holds in varian medical systems nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary 
under the amended bofa credit facility  vms s japanese subsidiary vms kk can borrow up to billion japanese yen as part of the overall credit facility the japanese line of credit 
at any time amounts are outstanding under the japanese line of credit  the full borrowing capacity is deemed committed for use in japan and therefore the maximum amount vms can otherwise borrow under the amended bofa credit facility will be reduced by million to million 
vms guarantees the payment of the outstanding balance under the japanese line of credit 
the amended bofa credit facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  permitted acquisitions  and other lawful corporate purposes 
borrowings under the japanese line of credit can be used by vms kk for refinancing certain intercompany debts  working capital  capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes 
borrowings under the amended bofa credit facility outside of the japanese line of credit accrue interest either i based on libor plus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda or ii based upon a base rate of either the federal funds rate plus or bofa s announced prime rate  whichever is greater  minus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda depending upon our instructions to bofa 
we may select borrowing periods of one  two  three or six months for advances based on the libor rate 
interest rates on advances based on the base rate are adjustable daily 
under the amended bofa credit facility  we pay commitment fees at an annual rate of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda 
borrowings under the japanese line of credit accrue interest at the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda 
the amended bofa credit facility  as well as the japanese line of credit  will expire on november   if not extended by mutual agreement of vms and bofa 
as of october   million was outstanding under the amended bofa credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of and none of which was outstanding under the japanese line of credit 
during fiscal year  the amount outstanding under the amended bofa credit facility including the japanese line of credit reached approximately million  which was primarily used to finance an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in august described further below under stock repurchase program 
the amended bofa credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this type 
we have also agreed to maintain certain financial covenants relating to i leverage ratios involving funded indebtedness and ebitda  ii liquidity  and iii consolidated assets 
as of october   we were in compliance with all covenants 
see also note credit facility to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the amended bofa credit facility 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which result from the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the united states and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations and current or future credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our available liquidity and cash flows from operations  as well as borrowed funds  to make strategic acquisitions  invest in the growth of our business  invest in advancing our systems and processes and repurchase vms common stock 
total debt as a percentage of total capital increased to at october  from at october  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to to at october  from to at october  
table of contents days sales outstanding trade accounts receivable dso were days at october  compared to days at october  our accounts receivable and dso are impacted by a number of factors  including primarily the timing of product shipments  collections performance  payment terms  and the mix of revenues from different regions 
as of october   less than of our accounts receivable balance was related to customer contracts with extended payment terms of more than one year

shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or under rule b share repurchase plans and may be made from time to time in one or more large blocks 
the fiscal year repurchase amounts include shares of vms common stock repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed on august  with bofa the repurchase agreement 
pursuant to the repurchase agreement  we paid to bofa million and bofa delivered  shares of vms common stock  representing approximately of the shares to be repurchased based on the closing price of vms common stock of on august  the specific number of shares that we ultimately will repurchase under the repurchase agreement will be based on the volume weighted average share price of vms common stock during the repurchase period  less a discount 
the repurchase period will end on february   provided that bofa has the right to accelerate the end of the repurchase period beginning on december  at the completion of the repurchase period  depending on the volume weighted average share price of vms common stock during the repurchase period  we may be entitled to receive additional shares of vms common stock from bofa or we may be required to deliver vms shares or  at our option  make a cash payment to bofa 
the remaining million  representing approximately of the cash payment to bofa  was recorded as an equity forward contract  which was included in capital in excess of par value in the consolidated balance sheet at october  all shares that have been repurchased have been retired

operating leases include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases as of october  as further described in note  retirement plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as of october   our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by million 
due to the impact of future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and other economic and demographic assumptions the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions to fund its defined benefit pension plans beyond the next fiscal year 
as further described in note  retirement plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as of october   our post retirement benefit plan had an estimated total benefit obligation of million 
due to changes in health care cost trend rates  mortality rates of plan participants  and the potential for us to change the type of health care plans offered or the level of contributions from plan participants  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions to fund its post retirement benefit plan beyond fiscal year the following items are not included in the table above long term income taxes payable includes the liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  and may also include other long term tax liabilities 
as of october   our liability for uncertain tax positions was million and we do not anticipate payment of these amounts in the next months 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  the liability for uncertain tax positions has been excluded from the table above

acquisition related commitments obligations when we acquired accel in january  accel was involved in a contract related lawsuit  which we settled by agreeing to perform certain services for a fixed price contract the fixed price contract 
as of october   we had a loss accrual of million in relation to the fixed price contract 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a new contract the new contract to perform certain services for a fixed price and we recorded a loss accrual of million in connection with the new contract 
as of october   the balance of the loss accrual related to this contingency the new contract was million 
if the actual costs related to the contingency exceed the estimated amount or if the estimated loss increases  the variances will be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which these variances arise 
other matters from time to time  we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings  claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters both in and outside the united states  arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
we accrue amounts  to the extent they can be reasonably estimated  that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss 
while we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency involving us  management does not believe any pending matter will be resolved in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  it is possible that a legal or other proceeding brought against us could have an impact of this nature 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for property damages  death and injury and for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the terms of these indemnification arrangements are generally perpetual 
except for losses related to property damages  the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is unlimited 
as of october   we have not incurred any significant costs since the spin offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these arrangements is minimal 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers and certain of our employees that serve as officers or directors of our foreign subsidiaries that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers and those certain employees against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers  and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued new guidance under accounting standards codification asc  which provides guidance on an employer s disclosure about plan assets of a defined benefit 
table of contents pension or other post retirement plan and requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets 
the new guidance under asc was effective for us as of the end of fiscal year the adoption of the new guidance concerns disclosure did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities to replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on our existing consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued the guidance related to the milestone method of revenue recognition asu  which recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for substantive milestones in research or development transaction 
asu is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu to provide guidance to enhance disclosures related to the credit quality of a company s financing receivables portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses 
pursuant to this accounting guidance  a company is required to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about its allowance for credit loss with the objective of facilitating users evaluation of the nature of credit risk inherent in the company s portfolio of financing receivables  how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
the revised disclosures as of the end of the reporting period will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  and the revised disclosures related to activities during the reporting period will be effective for us beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting update on its financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging activities 
these counterparties are large international and regional financial institutions and to date  no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligation to us under such contracts 
in addition  cash and cash equivalents held with financial institutions may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions 
we also may need to rely on the credit facility described below 
our access to our cash and cash equivalents or ability to borrow could be reduced if one or more financial institutions with which we have deposits or from which we borrow should fail or otherwise be adversely impacted by conditions in the financial or credit markets 
conditions such as those we experienced as a result of the economic downturn and accompanying contraction in the credit markets heighten these risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia  australia and canada 

table of contents we have many transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain of those financial exposures through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and may hedge certain of these larger foreign currency transactions when they are not transacted in the subsidiaries functional currency 
the foreign currency sales transactions that fit our risk management policy criteria are hedged with forward contracts 
we may use other derivative instruments in the future 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward contracts range from one to twelve months in maturity 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 
the notional values and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates of our sold and purchased forward exchange contracts outstanding at october  were as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased weighted average contract rate foreign currency units per usd australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro indian rupee japanese yen new zealand dollar norwegian kron swedish krona swiss franc totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio and short term borrowings

borrowings under the japanese line of credit accrue interest at the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin 

table of contents we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable under the amended bofa credit facility including the japanese line of credit 
as of october   the amount outstanding under the amended bofa credit facility was million  none of which was outstanding under the japanese line of credit  with interest being accrued on libor plus a margin

in addition  we had million of long term debt including the current maturities of long term debt outstanding at october  that carried at a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in various installments over a four year period

the fair value of our long term debt was estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt was estimated to be million at october  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
