item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are an innovative packaged food company focused on building  acquiring and energizing brands 
our company was founded in and has a proven track record of growth  which is reflected in the growth of our revenues from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we specialize in processing  marketing and distributing snack products and culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts 
in  we complemented our strong heritage in the culinary nut market under the diamond of california brand by launching a full line of snack nuts under the emerald brand 
in september  we acquired the pop secret brand of microwave popcorn products  which provided us with increased scale in the snack market  significant supply chain economies of scale and cross promotional opportunities with our existing brands 
on march   we completed our acquisition of kettle foods  a leading premium potato chip company in the two largest potato chip markets in the world  the united states and united kingdom  which added the complementary premium brand kettle to our existing portfolio of leading brands in the snack industry 
the results of kettle foods operations are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly large national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors to independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we also sell our products to mass merchandisers  club stores  convenience stores and through other retail channels 
our business is seasonal 
for example  in and  we recognized and of our net sales for the full fiscal year in the first six months of the year 
demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent culinary nuts  is highest during the months of october  november and december 
we receive walnuts during the period from september to november and process them throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last quarter of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at our facilities  which routinely operate at capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
generally  we receive and pay for approximately of the corn for popcorn in december  and approximately in may 
accordingly  the working capital requirement of our popcorn and potato chip product lines is less seasonal than that of the tree nut product lines 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
the amount we accrue for promotion is based on an estimate of the level of performance of the trade promotion  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs 
customers have the right to return certain products 
product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in sales 

table of contents inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or market basis 
we have entered into long term walnut purchase agreements with growers  under which they deliver their entire walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season and we determine the minimum price for this inventory by march  or later  of the following calendar year 
this purchase price will be a price determined by us in good faith  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality  and nut varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate price to be paid will be determined subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  we must make an estimate of price for interim financial statements 
those estimates may subsequently change and the effect of the change could be significant 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or more often if there are indications of possible impairment 
the analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts  including estimated future cash flows  estimates of long term growth rates for our business  the expected life over which cash flows will be realized  and assumed royalty and discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge 
while the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on our current estimates and assumptions  materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions  changes in our business or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
for brand intangible assets not subject to amortization  we test for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing brand intangibles for impairment  we compare the fair value with the carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using inputs such as forecasted future revenues attributable to the brand  assumed royalty rates  and a risk adjusted discount rate that approximates our estimated cost of capital 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the brand intangible asset is considered impaired  and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the brand intangible asset 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by asc as of june th of each year 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we initially compare the fair value of the company s single reporting unit with the net book value of the company since it represents the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we have one operating and reportable segment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  we perform an additional step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities and then computing the excess of the reporting units fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
accordingly  we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of such excess 
our impairment assessment employs present value techniques and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including a projection of future revenues  gross margins  operating costs and cash flows  as well as general economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we also consider the estimated fair value of our reporting unit in relation to the company s market capitalization 
we cannot guarantee that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
this guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
this guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
under this guidance  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
results of operations compared to net sales were million and million for the years ended july  and the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased snack sales including kettle foods 
this was offset in part by lower culinary sales 
net sales by channel in thousands year ended july  change from to retail international non retail north american ingredient food service other total retail represents sales of our culinary  snack and in shell products

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent upon funds generated from operations and external sources of financing 
during the year ended july   cash used in operating activities was million compared to million provided by operating activities during the year ended july  the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to increased investments in inventory and the timing of accounts payable payments between years 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this increase was mainly due to the acquisition of kettle foods for approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to long term borrowings used to fund the kettle foods acquisition and to our equity offering 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended july  was million compared to million during the year ended july  the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to improved profitability 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this increase was mainly due to the acquisition of pop secret for approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million of cash used in financing activities in this change was mainly attributable to long term borrowings used to fund the pop secret acquisition  offset by repayments 
on february   we entered into an agreement to replace our existing credit facility with a new five year million secured credit facility the secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the company used the borrowings under the secured credit facility to fund a portion of the kettle foods acquisition and to fund ongoing operations 
our new secured credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of july   and a million term loan facility  of which million was outstanding as of july  scheduled principal payments on the term loan are million in fiscal year  million in each of the succeeding three years due quarterly  and million for each of the first two quarters in fiscal year  with the remaining principal balance and any outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility to be repaid on the fifth anniversary of initial funding 
borrowings under the secured credit facility will bear interest  at diamond s option  at either the agent s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor rate  plus a margin for libor loans ranging from to  based on the consolidated leverage ratio which is defined as the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
substantially all of the company s tangible and intangible assets are considered collateral security under the secured credit facility 
the new secured credit facility also provides for customary affirmative and negative covenants  including a debt to ebitda ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of july  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the secured credit facility and the predecessor credit facility  respectively 
on march   we issued  shares of common stock priced at per share 
after deducting the underwriting discount and other related expenses  we received total net proceeds from the sale of our common stock of approximately million 
the proceeds from the equity offering were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the kettle foods acquisition 
working capital and stockholders equity were million and million at july  compared to million and million at july  the increase in working capital was due to increases in receivables and inventory related to the kettle foods acquisition  offset by increases in current portion of long term debt and payables 

table of contents we believe our cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be provided from our operations  in addition to borrowings available under our secured credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our contractual commitments  repay obligations as required  and fund our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations and commitments at july  were as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years revolving line of credit long term obligations interest on long term obligations a operating leases purchase commitments b pension liability long term deferred tax liabilities c other long term liabilities d total a amounts represent the expected cash interest payments on our long term debt 
interest on our variable rate debt was forecasted using a libor forward curve analysis as of july  b commitments to purchase inventory and equipment 
excludes purchase commitments under walnut purchase agreements due to uncertainty of pricing and quantity 
c primarily relates to intangible assets of kettle foods 
d excludes million in deferred rent liabilities  million in deferred income and million of other non current liabilities 
additionally  the liability for uncertain tax positions million at july   excluding associated interest and penalties has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts  corn  potatoes  oils and other ingredients 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation is likely to however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  interest rates on borrowings and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality  and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds  other nuts  corn  potatoes and oils are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and 
table of contents yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the exposure to our cash equivalents for changes in interest rates  which are primarily affected by credit quality and the type of cash equivalents we hold 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be a decrease or increase of pretax income of approximately million 
interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on the libor 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily in the united kingdom 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of july  are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or cash flows 
additionally  our sales of finished goods and purchases of raw materials and supplies from outside the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
however  in july  we entered into a series of foreign exchange collars to hedge a portion of our expected canadian dollar denominated sales of kettle foods between september and january thus  certain revenues and expenses have been  and are expected to be  subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results
