item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the realization of which may be impacted by certain important factors including  but not limited to  those risk factors disclosed pursuant to part  item a 
introduction and overview powerwave is a global supplier of end to end wireless solutions for wireless communications networks 
our business consists of the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of products to improve coverage  capacity and data speed in wireless communications networks  including antennas  boosters  combiners  cabinets  shelters  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  remote radio head transceivers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions 
these products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world which support voice and data communications by use of cell phones and other wireless communication devices 
we sell our products to both original equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products into their proprietary base stations which they then sell to wireless network operators  and directly to individual wireless network operators for deployment into their existing networks 
during the last ten years  demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
while demand for wireless infrastructure was strong during  it weakened for powerwave during and due to significant reductions at three major customers  as well as a general slowdown in overall demand within the wireless infrastructure industry 
for most of  demand once again increased 
however  in the fourth quarter of  demand for our products was negatively impacted by the global economic recession 
this significantly impacted demand during  and our revenues fell by from levels  thus negatively impacting our financial results 
during and  we initiated several cost cutting measures aimed at lowering our operating expenses 
these initiatives will continue and we may be required to further reduce operating expenses if there is a significant or prolonged reduction in spending by our customers 
in the past there have been significant deferrals in capital spending by wireless network operators due to delays in the expected deployment of infrastructure equipment and financial difficulties on the part of the wireless network operators who were forced to consolidate and reduce spending to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their profitability 
economic conditions  such as the turmoil in the global equity and credit markets  as well as the global recession  and the rise of inflationary pressures related to rising commodity prices  have also had a negative impact on capital spending by wireless network operators  and will likely have a negative impact going forward in the near term 
all of these factors can have a significant negative impact on overall demand for wireless infrastructure products  and at various times  have directly reduced demand for our products and increased price competition within our industry which has in the past led to reductions in our revenues and contributed to our reported operating losses 
in addition to the significant reduction in revenues during  an example of prior reductions was during fiscal and  when we experienced a significant slowdown in demand from one of our direct network operator customers  at t  as well as reduced demand from several of our original equipment manufacturing customers  including nokia siemens and nortel networks  all of which combined to result in directly reduced demand for our products and contributed to our operating losses for both fiscal and we believe that we have maintained our overall market share within the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market during this period of changing demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment 
we continue to invest in the research and development of wireless communications network technology and the diversification of our product offerings  and we believe that we have one of our industry s leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our proprietary design technology is a further differentiator for our products 
looking back over the last six years  beginning in fiscal  we focused on cost savings while we expanded our market presence  as evidenced by our acquisition of lgp allgon 
this acquisition involved the integration of two companies based in different countries that previously operated independently  which was a complex  costly and time consuming process 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on cost savings while we expanded our market presence  as evidenced by our acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of remec  inc s wireless systems business the remec wireless acquisition 
we believe that this acquisition further strengthened our position in the global wireless infrastructure market 
in october  we completed the filtronic plc wireless acquisition 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provided us with the leading position in transmit and receive filter products  as well as broadening our rf conditioning and base station solutions product portfolio and added significant additional technology to our intellectual property portfolio 
for fiscal years  and  we completed the integration of this acquisition  as well as focused on consolidating operations and reducing our overall cost structure 
during this same time  we encountered a significant unanticipated reduction in revenues  which caused us to revise our integration and consolidation plans with a goal of further reducing our operating costs and significantly lowering our breakeven operating structure 
as has been demonstrated during the last six years  these acquisitions do not provide any guarantee that our revenues will increase 
as we enter  we have a small number of ongoing restructuring activities which are aimed at further reducing our overall operating cost structure 

table of contents we measure our success by monitoring our net sales by product and consolidated gross margins  with a short term goal of maintaining a positive operating cash flow while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
we believe that there continues to be long term growth opportunities within the wireless communications infrastructure marketplace  and we are focused on positioning powerwave to benefit from these long term opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the critical accounting policies that we believe are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of products 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or delivery and passage of title depending upon the terms of the sale provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we offer certain customers the right to return products within a limited time after delivery under specified circumstances  generally related to product defects 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which these returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and credit worthiness  as well as various other factors as determined by our review of their credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are highly concentrated in a small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
depending on the product line and other factors  we estimate future demand based on either historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demand for such products  or the forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these provisions reduce the cost basis of the respective inventory and are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past seven fiscal years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional charges in our cost of goods sold at the time of this determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventory is sold 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 

table of contents income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial accounting and tax reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting guidance now codified as financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of our cumulative federal and state net operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of our gross deferred tax assets 
for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not result in a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  current and future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
acquired tax liabilities related to prior tax returns of acquired entities at the date of purchase are recognized based on our estimate of the ultimate settlement that may be accepted by the tax authorities 
we continually evaluate these tax related matters 
at the date of any material change in our estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liabilities previously recognized are adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 
however  effective beginning in  adjustments to acquired tax liabilities will increase or decrease income tax expense in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  income taxes intraperiod tax allocation  clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fasb asc topic seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fasb asc topic and have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns for all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the periods subject to examination for our us federal return are the through tax years  including adjustments to net operating loss and credit carryovers to those years 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitation generally ranging from to years 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price over fair value recorded as goodwill 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development  we typically engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and expected costs to complete development projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the successful completion of development projects  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill might have occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to the accounting value of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize subjective valuations for the reporting unit based upon a discounted cash flow analysis as well as quoted market prices of our common stock plus an estimated market premium based upon companies with similar market transactions 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of various factors including estimates of forecasted revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
if the forecast assumptions utilized materially change  it could result in a lower fair value calculation which could require an impairment of existing goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the underlying net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is less than the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all its underlying identifiable assets and liabilities 

table of contents purchased intangible assets with determinable useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which generally range up to six years 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets  including fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based on the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
the actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from our estimates due to increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value of an asset is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
while we do not believe that any of our long lived assets are currently impaired  there have been other impairments in the past  and any future impairment of our long lived assets could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
vendor cancellation liabilities we purchase subassemblies and finished goods from contract manufacturers under purchase agreements that limit our ability to cancel deliveries inside defined lead time windows 
when a contract manufacturer submits a cancellation claim  we estimate the amount of inventory remaining to be purchased against that claim 
any excess of the estimated purchase over the projected consumption of the related product is recorded as a charge to cost of sales and an increase to accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
depending on the product line and other factors  we estimate future demand based on either historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demand for such products  or the forecast of product demands and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of vendor cancellation liability 
our history shows that demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of vendor cancellation liabilities 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for vendor cancellation liabilities 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the amount of vendor cancellation liabilities and our reported operating results 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for standard warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of the sale and update these estimates throughout the warranty period 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
we also have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to our products outside of our standard warranty period if such defect were to occur 
any costs related to epidemic defects are generally recorded at the time the epidemic defect becomes known to us and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
while we have occasionally experienced significant costs due to epidemic defects  historically  we have not regularly experienced significant costs related to epidemic defects 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience significant costs to repair epidemic defects in the future 
a significant increase in product return rates or in the costs to repair our products  or an unexpected epidemic defect in our products  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results during the period in which the returns or additional costs materialize 
subsequent events we have evaluated activities through february   and all known subsequent events have been included in this report 

table of contents accruals for restructuring and impairment charges we recorded million  million and million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal years  and  respectively 
these include charges of million and million related to the impairment of goodwill in and  respectively  and charges of million and million related to the impairment of our intangible assets in and  respectively 
see further discussions of these charges under operating expenses below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring plan in january  we formulated and began to implement a plan to further reduce manufacturing overhead costs and operating expenses 
as part of this plan  we initiated personnel reductions in both our domestic and foreign locations  with primary reductions in the united states  estonia and sweden 
these reductions were undertaken in response to current economic conditions and the ongoing global macroeconomic slowdown that began in the fourth quarter of we finalized this plan in the fourth quarter of  however  additional amounts may be accrued in related to actions associated with this plan 
a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  exit or disposal obligations 
pursuant to this guidance  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for a liability for one time employee termination benefits that is incurred over time 
in the unusual circumstance in which fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the liability shall be recognized initially in the period in which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the restructuring and integration plan is subject to continued future refinement as additional information becomes available 
we expect that the workforce reduction amounts will be paid through the second quarter of restructuring plan in june  we formulated and began to implement a plan to further consolidate operations and reduce manufacturing and operating expenses 
as part of this plan  we closed our salisbury  maryland manufacturing facility and transferred most of the production to our other manufacturing operations 
in addition  we closed our design and development center in bristol  uk and discontinued manufacturing operations in kempele  finland 
these actions were finalized in the first quarter of a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in fasb asc topic the restructuring and integration plan is subject to continued future refinement as additional information becomes available

table of contents restructuring plan in the second quarter of  we formulated and began to implement a plan to further consolidate operations and reduce operating costs 
as part of this plan  we closed our design and development centers in el dorado hills  california and toronto  canada  and discontinued our design and development center in shipley  uk 
also as part of this plan  we sold our manufacturing operations located in hungary to sanmina sci  a third party contract manufacturing supplier  and entered into a manufacturing services agreement with sanmina sci 
the transaction included inventories and fixed assets and included a sublease of the existing facility  along with the assumption of certain liabilities  including all transferred employees 
we finalized this plan in the fourth quarter of a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows facility closures equipment write downs balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in fasb asc topic the remaining payments on this plan were made during  and all actions associated with this plan have been completed 
plan for consolidation of operations in the fourth quarter of  and in connection with the filtronic plc wireless acquisition  we formulated and began to implement a plan to restructure our global manufacturing operations  including the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in wuxi and shanghai  china  into the manufacturing facility located in suzhou  china 
the plan includes a reduction of workforce  impairment and disposal of inventory and equipment utilized in discontinued product lines  and facility closure costs 
in addition  we also ceased the production of certain product lines manufactured at these facilities to eliminate duplicative product lines 
a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the plan for consolidation of operations for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows facility closures equipment write downs balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in fasb asc topic the remaining payments on this plan were made during  and all actions associated with this plan have been completed 
integration of lgp allgon and remec  inc s wireless systems business we recorded liabilities in connection with the acquisitions for estimated restructuring and integration costs related to the consolidation of remec  inc s wireless systems business and lgp allgon s operations  including severance and future lease obligations on excess facilities 
these estimated costs were included in the allocation of the purchase consideration and resulted in additional goodwill pursuant to the accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  business combinations 
the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance in fasb asc topic the implementation of the restructuring and integration plan is complete 

table of contents a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the integration of the remec  inc s wireless systems business and lgp allgon for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows facility closures equipment write downs balance at december  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  we expect that the facility closure amounts will be paid out over the remaining lease term which extends through january all of these restructuring and impairment accruals related primarily to workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities  and the discontinuation of certain product lines  including the associated write downs of inventory  manufacturing and test equipment  and certain intangible assets 
such accruals were based on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters which were uncertain at the time  including the timing and amount of sublease income that would be recovered on vacated property and the net realizable value of used equipment that is no longer needed in our continuing operations 
while we used our best current estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time to quantify these charges  different estimates could reasonably be used in the relevant periods to arrive at different accruals and or the actual amounts incurred or recovered may be substantially different from the assumptions utilized  either of which could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations for a given period 
as a result  we periodically review the estimates and assumptions used and reflect the effects of those revisions in the period that they become known 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  as the single source of authoritative non governmental us gaap 
fasb asc topic does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the fasb codification will be considered non authoritative 
these provisions of fasb asc topic were effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and  accordingly  were effective for us for the current fiscal reporting period 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations  but will impact our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre codification standards 
on the effective date of fasb asc topic  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  and all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
in may  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for  and disclosures of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this pronouncement was effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our business  results of operations or financial position  however  the provisions of fasb asc topic resulted in additional disclosures with respect to subsequent events 
in april  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which amends previous guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as annual financial statements in the current economic environment 
this pronouncement was effective for periods ending after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations  however  these provisions of fasb asc topic resulted in additional disclosures with respect to the fair value of our financial instruments 
in november  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  which applies to defensive intangible assets  which are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them 
as these assets are separately identifiable  this pronouncement requires an acquiring entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting  and such assets should be amortized to expense over the period such assets diminish in value 
defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with fasb asc topic this pronouncement was effective for financial statements in the first quarter of the adoption of the provisions of fasb asc topic did not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the pronouncement was effective in the first quarter of the adoption of the provisions of fasb asc topic did not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  business combinations  which changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
the provisions of fasb asc topic were effective in the first quarter of the adoption of the provisions of fasb asc topic did not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued an update to fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
this accounting standards update asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under previous accounting guidance  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended january   december  and december  fiscal years ended january  december  december  net sales cost of sales cost of goods intangible amortization restructuring and impairment charges total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative intangible asset amortization restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charge total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss years ended january  and december  net sales our sales are derived from the sale of wireless communications network products and coverage solutions  including antennas  boosters  combiners  cabinets  shelters  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  remote radio head transceivers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions for use in cellular  pcs  g  and g wireless communications networks throughout the world 
the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon our various customer groups fiscal years ended in thousands customer group january  december  wireless network operators and other original equipment manufacturers total sales decreased by to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease was due to several factors  including decreased demand from both our network operator customers and our original equipment manufacturer customers  which decreased by approximately and  respectively 
the decreases were primarily due to significantly reduced demand related to the global macroeconomic crisis and associated global credit crisis and economic recession that began in the fall of this economic instability and the tight credit markets have impacted our customers demand for products throughout fiscal 
table of contents the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon our various product groups fiscal years ended in thousands wireless communications product group january  december  antenna systems base station systems coverage systems total antenna systems consist of base station antennas and tower mounted amplifiers 
base station systems consist of products that are installed into or around the base station of wireless networks and include products such as boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  versaflex cabinets and radio transceivers 
coverage systems consist primarily of repeaters and advanced coverage solutions 
the decrease in all product group sales as listed in the table above is due to the significantly reduced demand related to the global economic crisis and recession impacting both our original equipment manufacturer and network operator customers during the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  we track the geographic location of our sales based upon the location of our customers to which we ship our products 
however  since many of our original equipment manufacturer customers purchase products from us at central locations and then re ship the product with other base station equipment to locations throughout the world  we are unable to identify the final installation location of many of our products 
the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon the geographic area to which a product was shipped fiscal years ended in thousands geographic area january  december  americas asia pacific europe other international total revenues decreased in all regions during fiscal as compared to fiscal with the exception of the other international category 
the slight increase in revenues in the other international category largely represents increased revenues in the middle east region 
the decrease in the other regions was largely due to contraction in both the network operator channel and the original equipment manufacturer sales channel  resulting from the global macroeconomic crisis and recession 
since wireless network infrastructure spending is dependent on individual network coverage and capacity demands  we do not believe that our revenue fluctuations for any geographic region are necessarily indicative of a trend for our future revenues by geographic area 
in addition  as noted above  growth in one geographic location may not reflect actual demand growth in that location due to the centralized buying processes of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
a large portion of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
during the last year  the value of the us dollar has fluctuated significantly against many other currencies 
we have calculated that when comparing exchange rates in effect for the year ended january  to those in effect for the year ended december   the change in the value of foreign currencies as compared with the us dollar had a negative impact on our revenues for fiscal of less than one percent 
this impact did not have a material impact on our sales 
we are unable to predict the future impact of such currency fluctuations on our future results 
for the year ended january   total sales to nokia siemens accounted for approximately of sales for the year 
for the year ended december   total sales to nokia siemens accounted for approximately of sales  and sales to alcatel lucent accounted for approximately of sales for the year 
sales to alcatel lucent accounted for less than of total sales for the year ended january  our business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of customers within the wireless communications market  and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in attracting new customers or retaining or increasing business with our existing customers 

table of contents a number of factors have caused delays and may cause future delays in new wireless infrastructure and upgrade deployment schedules throughout the world  including those in the united states  europe  asia  south america and other areas 
in addition  a number of factors may cause original equipment manufacturers to alter their outsourcing strategies concerning certain wireless communications network products  which could cause such original equipment manufacturers to reduce or eliminate their demand for external supplies of such products or shift their demand to alternative suppliers or internal suppliers 
such factors include lower perceived internal manufacturing costs and competitive reasons to remain vertically integrated 
due to the possible uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and original equipment manufacturer demand  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand from our original equipment manufacturer and network operator customers 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in our revenues and or operating results  which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of sales and gross profit our cost of sales includes both fixed and variable cost components and consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs  warranty costs and amortization of product related intangibles 
components of our fixed cost structure include test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  typically the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as manufacturing volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and manufacturing volumes decline due to higher amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales
