item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview abaxis  inc develops  manufactures  markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in the human or veterinary patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a blood analysis system  consisting of a compact portable analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on human patients and tests on veterinary patients 
we manufacture the system in our manufacturing facility in union city  california and we market our blood chemistry analyzers in both the medical market and in the veterinary market  as described below 
medical market we currently market the blood analysis system in the medical market under the name piccolo xpress 
through october  we marketed the blood analysis system in the medical market as the piccolo  now referred to as the piccolo classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of piccolo xpress and piccolo classic chemistry analyzers 
veterinary market we currently market the blood analysis system in the veterinary market under the name vetscan vs 
through march  we marketed the blood analysis system in the veterinary market as the vetscan  now referred to as the vetscan classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan vs and vetscan classic chemistry analyzers 
in september  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hm the vetscan hm offers a parameter complete blood count cbc analysis  including a five part differential cell counter specifically designed for veterinary applications 
in may  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument that offers an parameter cbc analysis  including a three part white blood cell differential  marketed originally as the vetscan hmii  and is now referred to as the vetscan hm we currently purchase the hematology instruments from diatron medical instruments plc 
of budapest  hungary 
through april  we marketed a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hmt 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan hm  vetscan hm  vetscan hmii and vetscan hmt hematology instruments 
we also market reagent kits to be used with our hematology instruments which we currently purchase from three suppliers clinical diagnostic solutions  inc  diatron medical instruments plc 
and mallinckrodt baker bv 
in july  our sales office in darmstadt  germany was incorporated as abaxis europe gmbh to market  promote and distribute diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses 
as a result  abaxis europe gmbh became a wholly owned subsidiary of abaxis 
the subsidiary was formed to provide customer support in a timely manner in response to the growing and increasingly diverse services needs of customers in the european market 
in january  we introduced a veterinary coagulation analyzer under the name vetscan vspro 
the vetscan vspro assists in the diagnosis and evaluation of suspected bleeding disorders  toxicity poisoning  evaluation of disseminated intravascular coagulation  hepatic disease and monitoring therapy and progression of disease states 
the point of care coagulation analyzer is offered with a combination assay pt aptt test cartridge for canine testing 
we currently purchase the coagulation analyzers and coagulation cartridges from scandinavian micro biodevices aps of farum  denmark 
in january  we introduced a canine heartworm rapid test under the name vetscan canine heartworm rapid test 
the vetscan canine heartworm rapid test is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of dirofilaria immitis in canine whole blood  serum or plasma 
the lateral flow immunoassay technology in the canine heartworm rapid tests provides immediate results 

table of contents in may  we entered into an exclusive agreement with abbott point of care inc  granting us the right to sell and distribute abbott s i stat handheld instrument i stat analyzer and associated consumables for blood gas  electrolyte  basic blood chemistry and immunoassay testing in the animal health care market worldwide 
our right to sell and distribute these products was initially non exclusive  but became exclusive in all countries of the world  except for japan  on november  our rights in japan remain non exclusive for the term of the agreement 
the initial term of the agreement ends on december   and after this initial term  our agreement continues automatically for successive one year periods unless terminated by either party 
we started marketing and sales activities of the i stat cartridges in the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we started marketing and sales activities of the i stat instrument 
we launched an abaxis branded version of the i stat instrument as part of our vetscan line in the third quarter of fiscal our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including but not limited to inventory or timing considerations by our distributors 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenues from such sales are allocated separately to the instruments and incentives based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenues allocated to incentives are deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer or are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred 
table of contents revenue balances was million  million and  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million  million and million  respectively 
the fluctuation in balances is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period and depends on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
we periodically offer programs to customers whereby certain instruments are made available to customers for rent or evaluation basis 
these programs typically require customers to purchase a minimum quantity of consumables during a specified period for which we recognize revenue on the related consumable according to the policies described above 
depending on the program offered  customers may purchase the instrument during the rental or evaluation period 
proceeds from such sale are recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
rental income  if any  are also recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
royalties are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the licensee 
our royalty revenue depends on the licensees use of our technology  and therefore  may vary from period to period and impact our revenues during a quarter 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period 
the distributor pricing rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during a qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to distributors or customers who purchase certain products or instruments during a promotional period 
cash rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of veterinary products during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to three months after sale 
changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
other rebate programs offered to distributors or customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
the following table summarizes the change in total accrued distributor and customer rebates in thousands balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  sales and other allowances 
we estimate a provision for defective reagent discs as part of our sales allowances when we issue credits to customers for defective reagent discs 
we also establish  upon shipment of our products to distributors  a provision for potentially defective reagent discs  based on estimates derived from historical experience 
the provision for potentially defective reagent discs was recorded in sales allowances  using internal data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel  the lag time for customers to report defective reagent discs and the historical rates of defective reagent discs 
starting on july   the provision for potentially defective reagent discs is recorded as part of warranty reserves  instead of sales allowances  since we replace defective reagent discs rather than issue a credit to customers 
changes in our estimates for accruals related to provisions for defective reagent discs have not been material to our financial position or results of 
table of contents operations 
in the future  the actual defective reagent discs may exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosure  establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
as of march   we used level assumptions for our cash equivalents  which are traded in an active market 
the valuations are based on quoted prices of the underlying security that are readily and regularly available in an active market  and accordingly  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data  including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active 
level also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models  such as interest rates and volatility factors  are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
at march   our short term investments totaled million and our long term investments totaled million  which were classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments ranges from one to three years 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenue is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
cost of revenues reflects estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period and any adjustments in estimated warranty expense for the installed base under our standard warranty obligation based on our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on our historical experience as to product failures  estimated product failure rates  estimated repair costs  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes under the warranty plan 

table of contents each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate of warranty reserves  including our assumptions 
during fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to pre existing warranties of  which reduced our warranty reserves and our cost of revenues  based on both a decrease in our historical experience as to product failures and our judgment of a decrease in estimated product failure rates of blood chemistry analyzers since we began taking steps to resolve manufacturing problems primarily from fiscal related to quality control for key components that we obtain from our suppliers and to design issues of the key components required 
our current portion of warranty reserves of million as of march  and non current portion of warranty reserves of  as of march  reflects our estimate of warranty obligations based on the number of instruments in standard warranty  estimated product failure rates and estimated repair costs 
a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when the related sale is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
the warranty cost includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc 
we review the historical warranty cost trends and analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the estimated product failure rate  expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
additionally  if factors change and we revise our assumptions on the product failure rate of instruments or reagent discs  then our warranty reserves and cost of revenues could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortized intangible assets  whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value and long lived assets are written down to their respective fair values 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts to be recovered 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
at march  and  we had no uncertain tax positions 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  and  we did not recognize any interest or 
table of contents penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of income  and at march  and  we had no accrued interest or penalties 
share based compensation expense 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
we did not grant stock options during fiscal  or for stock options granted prior to march   we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  including risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term and expected dividends 
for restricted stock units  share based compensation expense is based on the fair value of our stock at the grant date 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by fair value provisions of share based compensation  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated over the requisite service period of the awards and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based compensation awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
share based compensation expense resulted in a material impact on our earnings per share and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and the impact of share based compensation expense on our consolidated financial results is disclosed in note  share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statement in this annual report on form k 
as of march   our unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted to employees and directors to date totaled million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
we expect that share based compensation will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
excluding forfeitures  we estimate expense recognition of restricted stock units over the requisite service period of the award  for awards granted and unvested as of march  as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal results of operations abaxis develops  manufactures  markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in the human or veterinary patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we started marketing the products and  upon achievement of certain milestones by smb outlined in the agreement  we will be subject to the minimum purchase commitments under the oem agreement 
these milestones have not yet been met and we are currently purchasing coagulation analyzers and coagulation cartridges on a purchase order basis  but all such purchases will count towards the minimum purchase obligations if and when they are triggered 
patent licensing agreement 
effective january  we entered into a license agreement with inverness medical switzerland gmbh inverness 
under our license agreement  we licensed co exclusively certain worldwide patent rights related to lateral flow immunoassay technology in the field of animal health diagnostics in the professional marketplace 
the license agreement provides that inverness shall not grant any future rights to any third parties under its current lateral flow patent rights in the animal health diagnostics field in the professional marketplace 
the license agreement enables us to develop and market products under rights from inverness to address animal health and laboratory animal research markets

our future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of our point of care blood analyzer products 
however  our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
regardless  we may seek to raise additional funds to pursue strategic opportunities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes with respect to our short term and long term investments and line of credit 
our investment objective is to invest excess cash in cash equivalents and in various types of investments to maximize yields without significantly increased risk 
at march   our short term investments totaled million  consisting of certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and municipal bonds  and our long term investments totaled million  consisting of certificates of deposits  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and us agency securities 
historically  our investment portfolio had included auction rate securities  which became illiquid as a result of the negative condition in the global credit markets 
in september  the bank where our auction rate securities were held  reached agreements with the financial industry regulatory authority  the state of michigan attorney general and the michigan office of financial and insurance regulation regarding the repurchase of auction rate securities 
in october  we received a commitment from our bank to repurchase all of our remaining auction rate securities  which repurchases were completed in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we redeemed million of our auction rate securities at of par value 
as of march   we no longer hold any auction rate securities 
we have the ability to hold the investments classified as held to maturity in our investment portfolio at march  until maturity and therefore  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our total investment balances at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have not experienced any significant loss on our investment portfolio during fiscal and for our line of credit  which provides for borrowings of up to million  the interest rate is equal to the bank s prime rate minus  which totaled at march  consequently  an increase in the prime rate would expose us to higher interest expenses 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in the prime rate applied to our line of credit balance at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no amount outstanding on our line of credit at march  as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification  derivatives and hedging 

table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations we operate primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the hematology instruments and hematology reagent kits purchased from diatron messtechnik gmbh  which are primarily denominated in euros 
in the first quarter of fiscal  operations from our sales office in darmstadt  germany were stated in euros and translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rates 
in july  the germany sales office was incorporated as our wholly owned subsidiary  abaxis europe gmbh  to market  promote and distribute diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses 
abaxis europe gmbh s functional currency is in us dollars 
foreign currency denominated account balances of our subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars at the end of period exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities  and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets 
accordingly  the effects of foreign currency transactions  and of remeasuring the financial condition into the functional currency  resulted in foreign currency gains and losses  which were included in interest and other income expense  net on our consolidated statements of income 
for our sales denominated in local currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenue 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro currency  the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions may result in reduced cost of revenues and operating expenses 
similarly  our cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against the euro currency
