cna competes with stock and mutual insurance companies  reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers 
cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services 
rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation 
cna competes for business not only on the basis of rate  but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers  ratings and quality of service  including claim adjustment services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the united states 
based on statutory net written premiums  cna is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the thirteenth largest property and casualty insurance organization in the united states 
regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports  and regulating capital adequacy and the type  quality and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulators  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payment 
insurers are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
further  insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
other insurance related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds  rating bureaus  insurance departments  and workers compensation second injury funds  or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process 
reform of the us tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry 
over the last decade  many states have passed some type of tort reform 
even though there has been some tort reform success  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders 
for example  some state legislatures are considering legislation addressing direct actions against insurers related to bad faith claims 
as a result of this unpredictability in the law  insurance underwriting and rating are expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and some specialty coverages 
although the federal government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures  terrorism risk mechanisms  federal financial services reform  federal regulation of insurance  various tax proposals affecting insurance companies

diamond offshore drilling  inc 
diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore  is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons 
diamond offshore owns offshore rigs 
diamond offshore accounted for  and of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and diamond offshore owns and operates semisubmersible rigs  consisting of high specification and intermediate rigs 
semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members 
such rigs operate in a semi submerged position  remaining afloat  off bottom  in a position in which the lower hull is approximately feet to feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface 
semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line 
semisubmersible rigs can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster dynamic positioning system to maintain the rig s position over a drillsite 
five semisubmersible rigs in diamond offshore s fleet have this capability 
diamond offshore s high specification semisubmersible rigs are generally capable of working in water depths of  feet or greater or in harsh environments and have other advanced features  as compared to intermediate semisubmersible rigs 
as of january   seven of the high specification semisubmersible rigs  including the recently acquired ocean courage  were located in the us gulf of mexico gom 
at that date diamond offshore had two high specification semisubmersible rigs operating offshore brazil  while a third was en route to brazil from the gom 
of 
table of contents item business diamond offshore drilling  inc continued diamond offshore s remaining high specification semisubmersible rigs  one was located offshore each of malaysia and angola  while the final rig  the ocean valor  was completing its commissioning in singapore 
diamond offshore s intermediate semisubmersible rigs generally work in maximum water depths up to  feet 
as of january   diamond offshore had intermediate semisubmersible rigs in various locations around the world 
seven of these semisubmersible rigs were operating offshore brazil and an eighth unit was en route to brazil  three were located in the north sea  two each were located offshore australia and offshore mexico  one was located in the gom and one offshore vietnam 
one unit was en route to the falkland islands  and the final intermediate semisubmersible rig  the ocean bounty  was in the process of being cold stacked in malaysia 
diamond offshore has one high specification drillship  the ocean clipper  which was located offshore brazil as of january  drillships  which are typically self propelled  are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a dynamic positioning system similar to those used on certain semisubmersible rigs 
deepwater drillships compete in many of the same markets as do high specification semisubmersible rigs 
diamond offshore has jack up drilling rigs 
jack up rigs are mobile  self elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform 
the rig hull includes the drilling rig  jacking system  crew quarters  loading and unloading facilities  storage areas for bulk and liquid materials  heliport and other related equipment 
diamond offshore s jack up rigs are used for drilling in water depths from feet to feet 
the water depth limit of a particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig s legs 
a jack up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea  as a vessel  with its legs retracted 
once over a drillsite  the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water 
after completion of drilling operations  the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite 
as of january   six of diamond offshore s jack up rigs were located in the gom and a seventh rig  the ocean scepter  was en route from uruguay for a six well drilling program in the gom 
four of those rigs are independent leg cantilevered units  two are mat supported cantilevered units  and one is a mat supported slot unit 
diamond offshore cold stacked the three mat supported jack up rigs located in the gom during the second quarter of and is no longer actively marketing these drilling units 
of diamond offshore s seven remaining jack up rigs  all of which are independent leg cantilevered units  two each were located offshore egypt and mexico  and one was located offshore each of indonesia  croatia and the joint petroleum development area between australia and timor leste 
diamond offshore s long term strategy has been to economically upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced  efficient  high tech rigs  particularly deepwater semisubmersible rigs  in order to maximize the utilization of  and dayrates earned by  the rigs in its fleet 
in addition  excluding diamond offshore s two new deepwater floaters acquired in  it has  since  increased the number of its rigs capable of operating in  feet or more of water from three rigs to of which are high specification units  primarily by upgrading its existing fleet 
seven of these upgrades were to diamond offshore s victory class semisubmersible rigs  the design of which is well suited for significant upgrade projects 
diamond offshore has two additional victory class intermediate semisubmersible rigs that could potentially be upgraded at some time in the future 
during  diamond offshore acquired two newbuild deepwater  semisubmersible  dynamically positioned drilling rigs  the ocean courage june and the ocean valor september 
the ocean courage is completing its commissioning and preparing for its first contract in the gom  which is expected to begin in the first quarter of commissioning of the ocean valor is expected to be completed in singapore in the first quarter of 
table of contents item business diamond offshore drilling  inc continued markets the principal markets for diamond offshore s contract drilling services are the following the gulf of mexico  including the us and mexico  south america  principally in brazil  europe  principally in the united kingdom  or uk  and norway  the mediterranean basin  including egypt  africa  currently in angola  australia and asia  including malaysia  indonesia and vietnam  and the middle east  including kuwait  qatar and saudi arabia 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
from time to time diamond offshore s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world as the market demands 
diamond offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in many respects 
for example  diamond offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the uk has been beneficial in australia and other international areas in which diamond offshore operates  while production experience it has gained through brazilian and north sea operations has potential application worldwide 
additionally  diamond offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables it to better understand that customer s needs and better serve that customer in different market segments or other geographic locations 
diamond offshore s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore typically obtains its contracts through competitive bidding  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control of diamond offshore 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
historically  dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  from time to time  diamond offshore s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or a group of wells  which diamond offshore refers to as a well to well contract  or a fixed term  which diamond offshore refers to as a term contract  and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract 
in addition  certain of diamond offshore s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice  and in most circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time  generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers and for different customers each during and during  and  one of diamond offshore s two customers in brazil  petr leo brasileiro sa  or petrobras  a brazilian multinational energy company that is majority owned by the brazilian government accounted for  and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues 
no other customer accounted for or more of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues during and  nor did any single customer account for or more of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues during 
table of contents item business diamond offshore drilling  inc continued brazil is the most active floater market in the world today 
the greatest concentration of diamond offshore s operating assets outside the united states is offshore brazil  where rigs in its fleet are either currently working or contracted to work during diamond offshore s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore brazil is billion  billion and million for the years  and  and billion in the aggregate for the years to please see md a under item for additional information 
competition the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which at the present time has a dominant market share 
the drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation  which could create additional large competitors 
some of diamond offshore s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than diamond offshore 
diamond offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have more than mobile rigs available worldwide 
the offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors  including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas  current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
customers may also consider rig availability and location  a drilling contractor s operational and safety performance record  and condition and suitability of equipment 
diamond offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous international  us  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under some circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use

please see md a under item for additional information 
boardwalk pipeline is currently engaged in the haynesville project and clarence compression project 
boardwalk pipeline serves a broad mix of customers  including marketers  local distribution companies  producers  electric power generators  intrastate and interstate pipelines and direct industrial users located throughout the gulf coast  midwest and northeast regions of the us competition boardwalk pipeline competes with other pipelines to maintain current business levels and to serve new demand and markets 
boardwalk pipeline also competes with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth opportunities 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to supply and flexibility and reliability of service 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where boardwalk pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines  including the rockies express pipeline that transports natural gas from northern colorado to eastern ohio and the mid continent express pipeline that transports natural gas from oklahoma and texas to alabama 
boardwalk pipeline will also directly compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
in addition  regulators continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of boardwalk pipeline s traditional customers 
as a result of the regulators policies  segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with boardwalk pipeline s pipeline services 
additionally  natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the natural gas industry has built  or is in the process of completing  significant new pipeline infrastructure that will support the development of unconventional natural gas supply basins across the us additional pipeline infrastructure projects are being proposed 
these new pipeline developments have increased competition in certain pipeline markets  resulting in lower price differentials between physical locations basis spreads 
basis spreads can impact the rates boardwalk pipeline will be able to negotiate with its customers when contracts come up for renewal 
despite these competitive conditions  assuming that customers use all of their reserved capacity  substantially all of the operating capacity on boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems is contracted for with a weighted average contract life of approximately years  although each year a portion of boardwalk pipeline s capacity becomes subject to re contracting risk 
for example  approximately of boardwalk pipeline s contracts are due to expire in seasonality boardwalk pipeline s revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and volatility 
weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation  which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across its pipeline systems 
colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs  both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput 
while traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurred during the winter months driven by heating needs  the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has reduced the seasonality of boardwalk pipeline s revenues over time 
during  approximately of boardwalk pipeline s revenues were recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
governmental regulation ferc regulates boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries under the nga of and the nga of ferc regulates  among other things  the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction 
where required  boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by ferc covering certain of its facilities  activities and services 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline for gas transportation are established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline for storage services on texas gas  with the exception of approximately bcf of working gas capacity on that system  are also established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
key determinants in ferc s cost of service rate making process are the costs of providing service  the allowed rate of 
table of contents item business boardwalk pipeline partners  lp continued return  throughput assumptions  the allocation of costs  the capital structure and the rate design 
ferc has authorized gulf south to charge market based rates for its firm and interruptible storage 
texas gas is authorized to charge market based rates for the firm and iss services associated with approximately bcf of its storage capacity 
texas gas is prohibited from placing new rates into effect prior to november   and neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a new rate case 
gulf crossing will have to either file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates by the end of the first quarter of boardwalk pipeline is also regulated by the dot under the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended by title i of the pipeline safety act of  which regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines 
boardwalk pipeline has received authority from the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa  an agency of the dot  to operate its recently completed inch pipeline expansion projects under special permits that will allow it to operate the pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to of the pipe s specified minimum yield strength smys 
boardwalk pipeline is seeking authority from phmsa to operate its fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures 
boardwalk pipeline will need to operate each of these pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures in order to transport all of the volumes it has contracted for with its customers 
phmsa retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for boardwalk pipeline to operate these pipelines at higher pressures 
boardwalk pipeline s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
such regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental regulations also require that boardwalk pipeline s facilities  sites and other properties be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
under the epa s regulations adopted in september of  boardwalk pipeline was required  beginning in january of  to monitor the ghg emissions from certain of its facilities  particularly compression stations  that emit more than  metric tons of ghg per year and must report on such emissions to the epa beginning in march of properties boardwalk pipeline is headquartered in approximately  square feet of leased office space located in houston  texas 
boardwalk pipeline also has approximately  square feet of office space in owensboro  kentucky in a building that it owns 
boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee 
however  substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights of way  easements  permits  licenses or consents

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or equity and or the business  results of operations  financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries 
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the sec or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us 
our subsidiaries  cna financial corporation  diamond offshore drilling  inc and boardwalk pipeline partners  lp  are public companies and file reports with the sec 
you are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities 
we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock 
our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to make funds available to us  whether in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to  among other things  the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries  applicable state laws  including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna  laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies  and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders 

table of contents item a 
risk factors deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to investment losses and lower cash balances at the parent company  which could impair our ability to fund acquisitions  share buybacks  dividends or other investments or to fund capital needed by our subsidiaries 
the us and global capital and credit markets experienced severe volatility  illiquidity  uncertainty and disruption in recent years  including among other things  large bankruptcies  government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  growing levels of defaults on indebtedness  recessionary economic conditions and widening of credit spreads 
these conditions resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses and substantially reduced investment income  including a significant decline in income from limited partnership investments  at cna and the parent company during should these or similar conditions recur  we could experience additional losses and further reduced investment income  which would among other things reduce the cash balances available at the parent company 
please see md a under item of this report for additional information on our investments 
certain of our operating subsidiaries require substantial amounts of capital or other financial support from time to time to fund expansions  enhance capital  refinance indebtedness  satisfy rating agency or regulatory requirements or for other reasons 
sufficient capital to satisfy these needs may not be available to our subsidiaries when needed on acceptable terms from the credit or capital markets or other third parties 
in such cases  we have in the past  and may in the future  provide substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to our subsidiaries  which may not be on market terms 
any such investments further reduce the amount of cash available at the parent company which might otherwise be used to fund acquisitions  share buybacks  dividends or other investments or to fund other capital requirements of our subsidiaries 
in addition  significantly reduced levels of cash at the parent company could make us unable or unwilling to fund future capital needs of our subsidiaries and result in a downgrade of our ratings by the major credit rating agencies 
we could have liability in the future for tobacco related lawsuits 
as a result of our ownership of lorillard  inc lorillard prior to the separation the separation  which was consummated in june  from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco related lawsuits 
we are currently a defendant in three such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco related suits  notwithstanding the completion of the separation 
in the separation agreement entered into between us and lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the separation  lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to lorillard s tobacco business  including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco related litigation against us 
an adverse decision in a tobacco related lawsuit against us could  if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible  in whole or in part  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and equity 
we do not expect that the separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco related claims 
we do not believe that we had or have any liability for tobacco related claims  and we have never been held liable for any such claims 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  cna financial corporation cna has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from the severe disruption in the capital and credit markets 
investment returns are an important part of cna s overall profitability 
general economic conditions  changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates  long term periods of low interest rates  credit conditions and currency  commodity and stock prices  including the short and long term effects of losses in relation to asset backed securities  and many other factors beyond cna s control can adversely affect the value of cna s investments and the realization of investment income 
further  cna invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater volatility than cna s fixed income investments 
limited partnership investments generally present greater volatility  higher illiquidity  and greater risk than fixed income investments 
as a result of all of these factors  cna may not realize an adequate return on cna s investments  may incur losses on sales of its investments  and may be required to write down the value of its investments 
therefore  the company s results of operations  equity and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents item a 
risk factors cna s underwriting results may continue to suffer as a result of the unfavorable global economic conditions 
overall global economic conditions may continue to be recessionary and highly unfavorable 
although many lines of cna s business have both direct and indirect exposure to these economic conditions  the exposure is especially high for the lines of business that provide management and professional liability insurance  as well as surety bonds  to businesses engaged in real estate  financial services and professional services 
as a result  cna has experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated underwriting losses with respect to these lines of business 
additionally  global recessionary conditions have led to decreased insured exposures causing cna to experience declines in premium volume 
consequently  the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be adversely impacted 
cna s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment 
cna s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  credit  and currency risks  many of which are unpredictable 
cna exercises significant judgment in analyzing these risks and in validating fair values provided by third parties for securities in its investment portfolio that are not regularly traded 
cna also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other than temporary 
securities with exposure to residential and commercial mortgage and other loan collateral can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions as to future collateral performance 
during  cna incurred significant unrealized losses in its investment portfolio 
during  financial markets were volatile and cna experienced improvement in its unrealized position 
in addition  during and cna recorded significant other than temporary impairment otti losses primarily in the corporate and other taxable bonds  asset backed securities and non redeemable preferred equity securities sectors 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments  cna may incur further unrealized losses and conclude that further other than temporary write downs of cna s investments are required 
as a result  the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 
additional information on cna s investment portfolio is included in the md a under item and notes   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item cna is unable to predict the impact on itself of governmental efforts and policy changes taken and proposed to be taken in response to the unfavorable economic conditions 
the federal government has implemented various measures  including the establishment of the troubled assets relief program pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act of  in an effort to deal with the ongoing economic conditions 
in addition  there are numerous proposals for further legislative and regulatory actions at both the federal and state levels  particularly with respect to the financial services industry 
since these new laws and regulations  or other policy changes  could involve critical matters affecting cna s operations  they may have an impact on cna s business and its overall financial condition 
due to this significant uncertainty  cna is unable to determine whether its actions in response to these governmental efforts will be effective or to predict with any certainty the overall impact these governmental efforts will have on it 
as a result  the company s results of operations and equity and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 
cna is subject to extensive federal  state and local governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues 
the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of cna s policyholders rather than its investors 
each state in which cna does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which it does business 
their regulations relate to  among other things  the following standards of solvency including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  
table of contents item a 
risk factors restrictions on cna s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired  insolvent or failed private or quasi governmental insurers  licensing of insurers and agents  approval of policy forms  limitations on the ability of cna s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to cna  and limitations on the ability to non renew  cancel or change terms and conditions in policies 
regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the states in which cna does business also require cna to provide coverage to persons whom cna would not otherwise consider eligible 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
any of these regulations could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
cna is subject to capital adequacy requirements and  if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements  regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit cna from operating its business 
insurance companies such as cna are subject to risk based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention 
these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset  premium and reserve components of cna s statutory capital and surplus reported in cna s statutory basis of accounting financial statements 
current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk based capital formula 
if cna does not meet these minimum requirements  state regulators may restrict or prohibit it from operating its business 
if cna is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances or if it incurs significant unrealized losses related to its investment portfolio  cna may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital 
examples of events leading cna to record a material charge against its earnings include impairment of cna s investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience 
loews has provided cna with substantial amounts of capital in prior years 
loews may be restricted in its ability or willingness to provide additional capital support to cna 
as a result  if cna is in need of additional capital  cna may be required to secure this funding from sources other than loews 
cna may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all 
rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of cna and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all 
ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
cna s insurance company subsidiaries  as well as cna s public debt  are rated by rating agencies  namely  am best company  moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s 
ratings reflect the rating agency s opinions of an insurance company s or insurance holding company s financial strength  capital adequacy  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders 
due to the intense competitive environment in which cna operates  the disruption in the capital and credit markets  the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for cna to take material unfavorable development in the future  
table of contents item a 
risk factors and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies  the rating agencies may take action to lower cna s ratings in the future 
if cna s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels  cna s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the severity of the impact on cna s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and  for certain products  which rating agency takes the rating action 
among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers  the inability to sell a material volume of cna s insurance products to certain markets  and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves 
in addition  it is possible that a lowering of the debt ratings of loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on cna s ratings  independent of any change in cna s circumstances 
cna has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds 
the ratings triggers are generally more than one level below cna s current ratings 
additional information on cna s ratings and ratings triggers is included in the md a under item cna s insurance subsidiaries  upon whom cna depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs  are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends 
cna is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends  loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations 
ordinary dividend payments  or dividends that do not require prior approval by subsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state 
the formula for the majority of the states is the greater of of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income  less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment 
some states  however  have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year s earned surplus 
if cna is restricted  by regulatory rule or otherwise  from paying or receiving inter company dividends  cna may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash 
as a result  cna would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all 
if cna determines that its recorded loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims  cna may need to increase its loss reserves 
cna maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits 
reserves represent cna s best estimate at a given point in time 
insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by cna  generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  many of which are highly uncertain  such as estimates of claims severity  frequency of claims  mortality  morbidity  expected interest rates  inflation  claims handling  case reserving policies and procedures  underwriting and pricing policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement 
many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on cna s part 
as trends in underlying claims develop  particularly in so called long tail or long duration coverages  cna is sometimes required to add to its reserves 
this is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to cna s earnings in the amount of the added reserves  recorded in the period the change in estimate is made 
these charges can be substantial 
additional information on cna s reserves is included in the md a under item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item cna is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on cna s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims  resulting in further increases in cna s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and equity 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
examples of emerging or potential claim and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals  
table of contents item a 
risk factors the effects of recessionary economic conditions and financial reporting scandals  which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims  due to corporate failures  these claims include both directors and officers d o and errors and omissions e o insurance claims  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices  construction defect claims  including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies  clergy abuse claims  including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of limitations  and mass tort claims  including bodily injury claims related to welding rods  benzene  lead  noise induced hearing loss and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  cna reviews and change its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
in addition  cna periodically undergoes state regulatory financial examinations  including review and analysis of cna s reserves 
if estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason  the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against cna s earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient 
these charges could be substantial and could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
loss reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves 
cna s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to asbestos and environmental pollution which cna refers to as a e claim and claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors including  among others  the following coverage issues including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories  continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation  changes in the frequency of asbestos and environmental pollution claims  changes in the severity of claims including bodily injury claims for malignancies arising out of exposure to asbestos  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excess policies cna has issued  cna s ability to recover reinsurance for these claims  and changes in the legal and legislative environment in which cna operates 
as a result of this higher degree of variability  cna has necessarily supplemented traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies  many of which involve significant judgment on its part 
consequently  cna may periodically need to record changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amounts that could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
additional information on a e claims is included in the md a under item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents item a 
risk factors asbestos claims 
the estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult in light of the factors noted above 
in addition  cna s ability to estimate the ultimate cost of asbestos claims is further complicated by the following inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes  as well as future court decisions  interpretation of specific policy provisions  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds  missing policies and proof of coverage  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties  novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants  uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be targeted in the future  volatility in frequency of claims and severity of settlement demands  increases in the number of non impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits  the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation  as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  medical inflation trends  the mix of asbestos related diseases presented  and the ability to recover reinsurance 
in addition  a number of cna s insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
if these insureds are successful in this regard  cna s potential liability for their claims would be unlimited 
some of these insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall within the so called non products liability coverage within their policies  rather than the products liability coverage  and that this non products liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit 
it is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims will succeed and  as a result  the ultimate size of these claims 
environmental pollution claims 
the estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated by liability and coverage issues arising from these claims 
cna and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims 
in addition to the coverage issues noted in the asbestos claims section above  key coverage issues in environmental pollution claims include the following whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies and accordingly whether cna would be liable for these costs  the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies  the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions  the potential for joint and several liability  and

to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues  thus adding to the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims 
further  the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensive litigation 
in many cases  courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent of cna s insurance policies 
additionally  the standards for cleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear  the number of sites potentially subject to cleanup under applicable laws is unknown  and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict 
catastrophe losses are unpredictable 
catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of cna s business 
various events can cause catastrophe losses  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  explosions  severe winter weather  and fires  and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable 
in addition  longer term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  and includes effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperatures  sea levels  rain  and snow 
the extent of cna s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of cna s insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves 
in addition  as in the case of catastrophe losses generally  it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to cna to be finally determined 
as cna s claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe  cna may be required to adjust its reserves  or take unfavorable development  to reflect its revised estimates of the total cost of claims 
cna believes it could incur significant catastrophe losses in the future 
therefore  the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 
additional information on catastrophe losses is included in the md a under item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item cna s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for cna s long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience 
cna s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity  which is the frequency and severity of illness  sickness and diseases contracted  policy persistency  which is the percentage of policies remaining in force  interest rates and future health care cost trends 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate  requiring cna to add to reserves  or take unfavorable development 
therefore  the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 
cna is unable to predict the impact of federal health care reform legislation 
the federal government may be implementing landmark health care reform legislation that could involve critical matters affecting cna s operations  particularly cna s workers compensation and long term care products 
until the legislation is enacted  cna is unable to predict with any certainty the overall impact it will have 
as a result  the company s results of operations and equity  and cna business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted 
cna s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance 
cna purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk 
under cna s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of its claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection cna purchases  which affects the level of cna s business and profitability  as well as the level and types of risk cna retains 
if cna is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable  cna may be unwilling to bear the increased risk

risk factors and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments 
therefore  the company s financial results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
additional information on reinsurance is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers 
cna has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves 
the ceding of insurance does not  however  discharge cna s primary liability for claims 
as a result  cna is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
certain of cna s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies 
a continuation or worsening of the current unfavorable global economic conditions could similarly impact all of cna s reinsurers 
in addition  reinsurers could dispute amounts which cna believes are due to it 
if cna is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers  cna s claims expenses will be higher which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and equity  and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
additional information on reinsurance is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item risks related to us and our subsidiary  diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices 
diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production in markets worldwide 
worldwide demand for oil and gas  oil and gas prices  market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity 
however  higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since diamond offshore s customers project development time  reserve replacement needs  as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for diamond offshore s rigs 
oil and gas prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond diamond offshore s control  including worldwide demand for oil and gas  the level of economic activity in energy consuming markets  the worldwide economic environment or economic trends  such as recessions  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  commonly called opec  to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the worldwide political and military environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the middle east  other oil producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity  the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital

risk factors weather conditions in the united states and elsewhere  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves  development and exploitation of alternative fuels  competition for customers drilling budgets from land based energy markets around the world  domestic and foreign tax policy  and advances in exploration and development technology 
the continuing global financial crisis and worldwide economic downturn has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on diamond offshore s business and financial condition 
the continuing worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and in some cases has reduced the availability of and or increased the cost of credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide  and has led to a worldwide economic recession 
this deterioration of the worldwide economy has resulted in reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas  exploration and production activity and offshore drilling services that has had a negative impact on our business and financial condition  including declines in dayrates earned by diamond offshore s drilling rigs and a decrease in new contract activity  which may continue and may worsen 
in addition  the worldwide economic recession has had  and could continue to have  a negative impact on diamond offshore s customers and or its suppliers including  among other things  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to diamond offshore 
additionally  if a potential customer is unable to obtain an adequate level of credit  it may preclude diamond offshore from doing business with that potential customer 
similarly  the restricted credit market could affect lenders participating in diamond offshore s credit facility  making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to diamond offshore 
any such reductions in drilling activity or failure by diamond offshore s customers  suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual obligations to diamond offshore  or diamond offshore s inability to secure additional financing  could adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
diamond offshore s industry is cyclical 
diamond offshore s industry has historically been cyclical 
there have been periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates  followed by periods of lower demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
diamond offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles 
periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
in response to a contraction in demand for its services  diamond offshore has cold stacked three of its rigs and is in the process of cold stacking a fourth unit 
diamond offshore may be required to idle additional rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of diamond offshore s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized 
as of february   diamond offshore s contract drilling backlog was approximately billion for contracted future work extending  in some cases  until generally  contract backlog only includes future revenue under firm commitments  however  from time to time  diamond offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been executed 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that diamond offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement where one does not currently exist 
in addition  diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments 
diamond offshore s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers inability to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 

table of contents item a 
risk factors diamond offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on its financial results 
diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
however  the number of potential customers has decreased in recent years as a result of mergers among the major international oil companies and large independent oil companies 
in  diamond offshore s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of its consolidated revenues 
diamond offshore expects petrobras  which accounted for approximately of diamond offshore s consolidated revenues in to continue to be a significant customer in while it is normal for diamond offshore s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed  the loss of any major customer may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 
the terms of diamond offshore s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and  to a lesser extent  the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors 
in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts  but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates  to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
conversely  in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
an inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit diamond offshore s profitability 
contracts for diamond offshore s drilling units are generally fixed dayrate contracts  and increases in diamond offshore s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts 
diamond offshore s contracts for its drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day  although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred 
many of diamond offshore s operating costs  such as labor costs  are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond diamond offshore s control 
the gross margin that diamond offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in diamond offshore s operating costs over the terms of the contracts 
in addition  for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses  diamond offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers which could adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
diamond offshore s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control 
diamond offshore s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  some of diamond offshore s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts 
these termination payments may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of a contract 
in addition  the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time 
during periods of depressed market conditions  diamond offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts 
diamond offshore s customers ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and the economic downturn 
if diamond offshore s customers cancel some of their contracts  and diamond offshore is unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of diamond offshore s contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
risk factors diamond offshore s business involves numerous operating hazards and diamond offshore is not fully insured against all of them 
diamond offshore s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punchthroughs  craterings and natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel  damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages 
in addition  offshore drilling operators are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather  and diamond offshore does not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover its rigs 
damage to the environment could also result from diamond offshore s operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
diamond offshore may also be subject to damage claims by oil and gas companies or other parties 
pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
diamond offshore s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover its losses  or may have exclusions of coverage for some losses 
diamond offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks  including  among other things  liability risk for certain amounts of excess coverage and certain physical damage risk 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity  it could adversely affect diamond offshore s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that diamond offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify diamond offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify it against all these risks 
in addition  no assurance can be made that diamond offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain insurance against some risks 
diamond offshore is self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
because the amount of insurance coverage available has been limited  and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially  diamond offshore has elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
this results in a higher risk of losses  which could be material  that are not covered by third party insurance contracts 
if one or more named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico cause significant damage to diamond offshore s rigs or equipment  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a significant portion of diamond offshore s operations are conducted outside the united states and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations 
diamond offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties  including risks of terrorist acts  war and civil disturbances  piracy or assaults on property or personnel  kidnapping of personnel  expropriation of property or equipment  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  foreign and domestic monetary policies  
table of contents item a 
risk factors the inability to repatriate income or capital  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions  travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats  and changing taxation policies 
diamond offshore is subject to the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control and other us laws and regulations governing its international operations 
in addition  international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which diamond offshore operates  including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling units  repatriation of foreign earnings  import export quotas or other trade barriers  oil and gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  and use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors 
some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors  require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete in those regions 
it is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry 
the actions of foreign governments may adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete 
the greatest concentration of diamond offshore s operating assets outside the united states is brazil  where it has rigs in its fleet either currently working or contracted to work during offshore brazil 
diamond offshore s drilling contracts offshore mexico expose it to greater risks than they normally assume 
diamond offshore currently operates and expects to continue to operate rigs drilling offshore mexico for pemex exploracion y produccion pemex  the national oil company of mexico 
the terms of these contracts expose diamond offshore to greater risks than they normally assume  such as exposure to greater environmental liability 
in addition  each contract can be terminated by pemex on days notice  contractually or by statute  subject to certain conditions 
while diamond offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks  diamond offshore can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on its future operations or financial results 

table of contents item a 
risk factors fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses 
due to diamond offshore s international operations  diamond offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency 
diamond offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise 
diamond offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings 
certain of diamond offshore s international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited doil  a wholly owned cayman islands subsidiary 
since forming this subsidiary it has been diamond offshore s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations 
during  doil made a non recurring distribution to its us parent company  and diamond offshore recognized us federal income tax expense on the portion of the distribution that consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to us federal income tax 
notwithstanding the non recurring distribution made in december of  it remains diamond offshore s intention to indefinitely reinvest the future earnings of doil to finance foreign activities  except for the earnings of diamond east asia limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of doil formed in december of it is diamond offshore s intention to repatriate the earnings of diamond east asia limited  and us income taxes will be provided on such earnings 
diamond offshore does not expect to provide for us taxes on any future earnings generated by doil  except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to us federal income tax or as they relate to diamond east asia limited 
should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary  diamond offshore may be required to record additional us income taxes 
public health threats could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s operations and financial results 
public health threats such as outbreaks of highly communicable diseases  which periodically occur in various parts of the world in which diamond offshore operates  could adversely impact its operations  the operations of its customers and the global economy  including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for diamond offshore s services 
any quarantine of personnel or inability to access diamond offshore s offices or rigs could adversely affect its operations 
travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which diamond offshore operates  or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
rig conversions  upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns 
from time to time  diamond offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to rigs or through new construction 
projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors  including the following shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  work stoppages  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  unanticipated cost increases  weather interferences  difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions  design and engineering problems  customer acceptance delays  
table of contents item a 
risk factors shipyard failures or unavailability  and failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes 
failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time  or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may  in some circumstances  result in the delay  renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract  resulting in a loss of revenue to diamond offshore 
if a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances  diamond offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  highmount exploration production llc highmount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels 
replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures 
highmount s future success depends largely upon its ability to find  develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless highmount replaces the reserves produced through successful development  exploration or acquisition  its proved reserves will decline over time 
highmount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
highmount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of reserves 
highmount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating activities 
if highmount s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget  there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements 
estimates of natural gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
estimating the volume of proved natural gas and ngl reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
actual future production  commodity prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from highmount s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of highmount s reserves 
in addition  highmount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history  results of exploration and development drilling  prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and ngl properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate representation of their value 
the effective interest rate at various times  and the risks associated with our business  or the oil and gas industry in general  will affect their value relative to the discount factor 

table of contents item a 
risk factors if commodity prices decrease  highmount may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of its properties 
highmount may be required  under full cost accounting rules  to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and ngl properties if commodity prices decline significantly  or if it makes substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves  or increases its estimates of development costs or experiences deterioration in its exploration results 
highmount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities 
under full cost accounting  highmount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum  or ceiling  of the book value of highmount s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value discounted at the required rate of of the future net cash flows from proved reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges  calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding month period 
if the net book value of highmount s exploration and production e p properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability exceeds its ceiling limitation  sec regulations require highmount to impair or write down the book value of its e p properties 
highmount recorded after tax ceiling test impairment charges of million and million in the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and ngl prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
depending on the magnitude of any future impairment  a ceiling test write down could significantly reduce highmount s income  or produce a loss 
as ceiling test computations involve the average first day of the month price for the preceding month period  it is impossible to predict the timing and magnitude of any future impairment 
additional information on the ceiling test is included in critical accounting estimates included in md a under item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item highmount may incur additional goodwill impairment charges if market conditions deteriorate 
highmount evaluates goodwill for impairment annually  or when events or circumstances change  such as an adverse change in business climate  that would indicate an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired when the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
highmount s annual impairment test  which is performed as of april th each year  is based on several factors requiring judgment 
a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may represent an impairment indicator requiring an assessment for the potential impairment of recorded goodwill 
also  a ceiling test impairment may represent a triggering event requiring highmount to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test 
should market conditions continue to significantly deteriorate  including further declining commodity prices  highmount could be required to record additional goodwill impairments that may be significant 
highmount recorded an after tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of please read critical accounting estimates included in md a under item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item natural gas  ngl and other commodity prices are volatile 
the commodity price highmount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
highmount is subject to risks due to frequent and often substantial fluctuations in commodity prices 
ngl prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile  and highmount expects this volatility to continue 
the markets and prices for natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond highmount s control 
these factors include demand  which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the impact of market and basis differentials market price spreads between two points across highmount s natural gas system  the impact of weather on the demand for these commodities  the level of domestic production and imports of these commodities  the impact of changes in technologies on the level of supply  
table of contents item a 
risk factors natural gas storage levels  actions taken by foreign producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
lower commodity prices may decrease highmount s revenues and may reduce the amount of natural gas and ngls that highmount can produce economically 
highmount engages in commodity price hedging activities 
highmount is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices 
the extent of highmount s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of highmount s hedging activities 
to the extent highmount hedges its commodity price risk  highmount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor 
furthermore  because highmount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of the volume of its expected natural gas supply and production of ngls  highmount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion 
highmount s actual future supply and production may be significantly higher or lower than highmount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period 
as a result  highmount s hedging activities may not be as effective as highmount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows  and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows 
in addition  even though highmount s management monitors its hedging activities  these activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement  the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective 
drilling for and producing natural gas and ngls is a high risk activity with many uncertainties 
highmount s future success will depend in part on the success of its exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
highmount s e p activities are subject to numerous risks beyond its control  including the risk that drilling will not result in oil and natural gas production volumes that are commercially viable 
highmount s decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
highmount s cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  many factors may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  labor or services  reductions in commodity prices

highmount s business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be fully covered by insurance 
highmount is not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect highmount s business  financial condition or results of operations 
highmount s e p activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas and ngls  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapse  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
if any of these events occur  highmount could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of highmount s operations and repairs to resume operations  any of which could adversely affect its ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses

risks related to us and our subsidiary  boardwalk pipeline partners  lp boardwalk pipeline needs to obtain and maintain authority from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures 
boardwalk pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which would utilize the maximum design capacity of its recently completed inch pipeline expansion projects and the fayetteville lateral assuming that boardwalk pipeline operates those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures up to smys  which increases the pipeline s peak day transmission capacity from that available at normal operating pressures up to smys 
in december of  boardwalk pipeline received authority from phmsa to operate its inch pipeline expansion projects at higher than normal operating pressures 
if phmsa were to withdraw such authority  boardwalk pipeline would not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipelines  beginning in mid  or boardwalk pipeline could incur additional costs to re obtain such authority or seek alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations  any of which could have a material adverse affect on boardwalk pipeline s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
risk factors boardwalk pipeline is seeking authority from phmsa to operate its fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures 
unless boardwalk pipeline obtains such authority from phmsa  boardwalk pipeline will not be able to operate the fayetteville lateral at its anticipated peak day transmission capacity  and beginning in mid  will not be able to transport all of the contracted for volumes on that pipeline 
in addition  boardwalk pipeline has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs to inspect  test and remediate pipe segments on the fayetteville lateral in order to obtain  or maintain if granted  authority to operate at higher than normal operating pressures or to develop alternative ways to meet boardwalk pipeline s contractual obligations  any of which could have a material adverse affect on boardwalk pipeline s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
phmsa retains discretion as to whether to grant  or to maintain in force  authority to operate a pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates 
boardwalk pipeline s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation 
as of december   approximately of the contracts for firm transportation capacity on boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems will expire during upon expiration  boardwalk pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long term basis 
key drivers that influence the rates that boardwalk pipeline s customers are willing to pay for transportation is the price differential of natural gas between physical locations  which can be affected by  among other things  the availability and supply of natural gas  available capacity  storage inventories  weather and general market demand in the respective areas 
the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond boardwalk pipeline s control  including existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to boardwalk pipeline s markets  development of new supplies located near key markets  the growth in demand for natural gas in boardwalk pipeline s markets  whether the market will continue to support long term contracts  the current price differentials  or market price spreads between various pipeline receipt and delivery points  and the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices 
increased competition could result in lower contracted pipeline capacity  decreased rates for boardwalk pipeline s services and reduced revenues 
boardwalk pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where boardwalk pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines  such as the rockies express pipeline and the mid continent express pipeline 
boardwalk pipeline will also compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
for new growth and expansion projects  boardwalk pipeline competes with other pipelines for contracts mainly with producers that would support such projects in order to transport their gas to market areas 
at an industry level  the various natural gas supply areas compete against one another to reach optimal market areas  and natural gas  as a commodity  competes with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  including electricity  coal and fuel oils  and other alternative fuel resources 
boardwalk pipeline s ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by competition or changing market conditions 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability 
ferc s policies promote competition in gas markets by increasing the number of gas transportation options available to boardwalk pipeline s customer base 
increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems or  in instances where boardwalk pipeline does not have long term contracts with 
table of contents item a 
risk factors fixed rates  could force boardwalk pipeline to decrease transportation or storage rates charged to its customers 
competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that could significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by boardwalk pipeline s operating subsidiaries  such as a recession or adverse economic conditions  weather  higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas 
the regulatory program that applies to interstate pipelines is different than the regulatory program that applies to many of boardwalk pipeline s competitors that are not regulated interstate pipelines 
this difference in regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete a project when it is regulated at the federal level 
boardwalk pipeline competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages because of the absence of ferc regulation 
in view of potential rate advantages and construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines  boardwalk pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors 
continued development of new supply sources could impact demand 
the discovery of non traditional natural gas production areas nearer to key market areas boardwalk pipeline accesses directly  or indirectly through third party pipeline interconnects  may compete with gas originating in production areas connected to boardwalk pipeline s system 
for example  the marcellus shale in pennsylvania  new york  west virginia and ohio  may cause gas in supply areas connected to boardwalk pipeline s system to be diverted to markets other than boardwalk pipeline s traditional market areas and may adversely affect capacity utilization on boardwalk pipeline s systems and its ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows 
in addition to supply volumes from the marcellus shale  gas from the rocky mountains  canada and lng import terminals may compete with and displace volumes from the gulf coast and mid continent supply sources in order to serve the midwest and east coast markets 
the displacement of gas originating in supply areas connected to boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems by these new supply sources that are closer to the end use markets could result in lower transportation revenues  which could have a material adverse impact on boardwalk pipeline s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
boardwalk pipeline is undertaking and may continue to pursue complex pipeline or storage projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect its business 
boardwalk pipeline has recently completed several pipeline expansion projects and may also undertake additional pipeline or storage projects in the future 
in pursuing previous projects  boardwalk pipeline has experienced significant cost overruns and may experience cost increases in the future 
boardwalk pipeline has also experienced delays in constructing and commissioning previous projects and may experience additional delays or cost increases in the future resulting from a variety of factors  including but not limited to the following delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  including delays in receiving authorization from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures under special permits  difficult construction conditions  including adverse weather conditions  delays in obtaining  or high demand for  key materials  and shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry 
in pursuing current or future projects  boardwalk pipeline could experience delays or cost increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to complete its current or future projects on the expected terms  cost or schedule  or at all 
in addition  boardwalk pipeline cannot be certain that  if completed  it will be able to operate these projects  or that they will perform  in accordance with expectations 
other areas of boardwalk pipeline s business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management s attention and other resources from its other business concerns to boardwalk pipeline s projects 
any of these factors could impair boardwalk pipeline s ability to realize revenues from its current or future projects sufficient to cover the costs associated with owning and operating these pipelines and to provide the benefits it had anticipated from the projects  which could

risk factors have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including its ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
boardwalk pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by boardwalk pipeline to them under certain no notice services and parking and lending pal services 
ferc gas tariffs only allow boardwalk pipeline to require limited credit support in the event that transportation customers are unable to pay for its services 
if any of boardwalk pipeline s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by boardwalk pipeline or contracted for with boardwalk pipeline  or to repay the gas they owe boardwalk pipeline  it could have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business 
in addition  as contracts expire  the failure of any of boardwalk pipeline s customers could also result in the non renewal of contracted capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business 
see item a for more information on credit risk arising from gas loaned to customers 
boardwalk pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues 
the loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in boardwalk pipeline s revenues 
boardwalk pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues 
for example  devon energy production company  lp represented over of boardwalk pipeline s revenues and boardwalk pipeline expects this customer to continue to account for more than of boardwalk pipeline s revenues 
additionally  boardwalk pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts and key customers on favorable terms 
the loss of all or even a portion of the contracted volumes of these customers  as a result of competition  creditworthiness or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business  financial condition  operating revenues and cash flows 
significant changes in energy prices could affect natural gas market supply and demand  or potentially reduce the competitiveness of natural gas compared with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  which could reduce system throughput and adversely affect boardwalk pipeline s revenues and available cash 
due to the natural decline in traditional gas production connected to boardwalk pipeline s system  boardwalk pipeline s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond its control including the price level of natural gas 
in general terms  the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond boardwalk pipeline s control 
these factors include worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions  the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas  the availability of lng  the availability of adequate transportation capacity  storage inventory levels  the price and availability of other forms of energy  the effect of energy conservation measures  the nature and extent of  and changes in  governmental regulation  for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation  and 
table of contents item a 
risk factors the anticipated future prices of natural gas  lng and other commodities 
it is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices  however the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years and global economic slowdown would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices 
downward movement in gas prices could negatively impact producers in nontraditional supply areas such as the barnett shale  the bossier sands  the caney woodford shale  the fayetteville shale and the haynesville shale  including producers who have contracted for capacity with boardwalk pipeline 
significant financial difficulties experienced by boardwalk pipeline s producer customers could impact their ability to pay for services rendered or otherwise reduce their demand for boardwalk pipeline s services 
high natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas 
a reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on boardwalk pipeline s systems  reduce the demand for boardwalk pipeline s services and could result in the non renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire 
boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to ferc s rate making policies which could limit boardwalk pipeline s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines  including earning a reasonable return 
boardwalk pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its transportation and storage operations 
for cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates boardwalk pipeline can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the cost of providing the service  the volumes of gas being transported  how costs are allocated between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
while neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a rate case  boardwalk pipeline s gulf crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter of to justify its rates 
customers of boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of its pipelines 
ferc recently challenged the rates of three non affiliated pipelines 
such a challenge against boardwalk pipeline could adversely affect its ability to establish reasonable transportation rates  to charge rates that would cover future increases in boardwalk pipeline s costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 
additionally  ferc can propose changes or modifications to any of its existing rate related policies 
if boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries were to file a rate case  or if boardwalk pipeline has to defend its rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or ferc  boardwalk pipeline would be required  among other things  to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in boardwalk pipeline s cost of service is just and reasonable 
under current ferc policy  since boardwalk pipeline is a limited partnership and does not pay us federal income taxes  this would require boardwalk pipeline to show that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to federal income taxation 
to support such a showing  boardwalk pipeline s general partner may elect to require owners of boardwalk pipeline s units to re certify their status as being subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries or boardwalk pipeline may attempt to provide other evidence 
boardwalk pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to ferc will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to us federal income tax liability on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline s jurisdictional pipelines 
if boardwalk pipeline is unable to make such a showing  ferc could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries  which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates 
an adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against any of boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its business 
boardwalk pipeline s operations are subject to catastrophic losses  operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which it may not be adequately insured 
there are a variety of operating risks inherent in boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems 
additionally  the nature and location of boardwalk pipeline s business may make boardwalk pipeline susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named 
table of contents item a 
risk factors storms  particularly with regard to its assets in the gulf coast region  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of boardwalk pipeline s operations  substantial repair costs  personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of boardwalk pipeline s operations and substantial financial losses 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks 
boardwalk pipeline currently possesses property  business interruption and general liability insurance  but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost 
moreover  such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms 
the insurance coverage boardwalk pipeline does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or all potential losses 
risks related to us and our subsidiaries generally in addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries  as discussed above  we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to  among other things  terrorism  hurricanes and other natural disasters  competition  government regulation  dependence on key executives and employees  litigation  dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws 
future acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries 
future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad  as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies  could have a significant impact on the businesses of certain of our subsidiaries  including the following cna 
cna continues to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts  despite the passage of the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of extended  until december   the program established within the us department of treasury by the terrorism risk insurance act of this program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government to share in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism 
given the unpredictability of the nature  targets  severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts  this program does not provide complete protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism 
further  the laws of certain states restrict cna s ability to mitigate this residual exposure 
for example  some states mandate property insurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss  thereby prohibiting cna from excluding terrorism exposure 
in addition  some states generally prohibit cna from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation policies 
consequently  there is substantial uncertainty as to cna s ability to contain its terrorism exposure effectively since cna continues to issue forms of coverage  in particular  workers compensation  that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act 
diamond offshore  boardwalk pipeline and highmount 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies might lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for oil and gas  which could affect the market for diamond offshore s oil and gas offshore drilling services  boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation  gathering and storage services and highmount s natural gas exploration and production activities 
in addition  it has been reported that terrorists might target domestic energy facilities 
while our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the security of their energy assets  there is no assurance that they can completely secure their assets  completely protect them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates 
loews hotels 
the travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following the world trade center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy levels and average room rates at loews hotels 
future terrorist attacks could similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm loews hotels 

table of contents item a 
risk factors certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters 
in addition to cna s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above  the businesses operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant harm from the effects of natural disasters  particularly hurricanes and related flooding and other damage 
while much of the damage caused by natural disasters is covered by insurance  we cannot be sure that such coverage will be available or be adequate in all cases 
these risks include the following diamond offshore 
diamond offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters  including the us gulf of mexico 
in september of  one of diamond offshore s jack up drilling rigs  the ocean tower  was damaged in hurricane ike  losing its derrick  drill floor and drill floor equipment 
in late august  one of diamond offshore s jack up drilling rigs  the ocean warwick  was seriously damaged during hurricane katrina and other rigs in diamond s fleet and its warehouse in new iberia  louisiana sustained lesser damage in hurricanes katrina or rita  or in some cases both storms 
in addition to damaging or destroying rig equipment  some or all of which may be covered by insurance  catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for diamond offshore  including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft  rig crew over time and employee assistance  hurricane relief supplies  temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by insurance 
boardwalk pipeline 
the nature and location of boardwalk pipeline s business  particularly with regard to its assets in the gulf coast region  may make boardwalk pipeline susceptible to catastrophic losses especially from hurricanes or named storms 
various other events can cause catastrophic losses  including windstorms  earthquakes  hail  explosions  and severe winter weather and fires 
the frequency and severity of these events are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves 
although boardwalk pipeline carries insurance  in the event of a loss the coverage could be insufficient or there could be a material delay in the receipt of the insurance proceeds 
loews hotels 
hotels operated by loews hotels are exposed to damage  business interruption and reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural disasters such as hurricanes 
for example  loews hotels properties located in florida and new orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding during the past five years 
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal  state and local governmental regulations which imposes or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies 
governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies 
risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following cna 
the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of cna s policyholders rather than its investors 
each state in which cna does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which cna does business 
their regulations relate to  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on cna s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired  insolvent or failed private or quasi governmental insurers  
table of contents item a 
risk factors licensing of insurers and agents  approval of policy forms  limitations on the ability of cna s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  and limitations on the ability to non renew  cancel or change terms and conditions in policies 
regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
cna also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
diamond offshore 
the drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and  accordingly  is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally 
diamond offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
it is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to diamond offshore s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity 
governments in some foreign countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries 
the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic  environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect diamond offshore s operations by limiting drilling opportunities 
the minerals management service of the us department of the interior  or mms  has established guidelines for drilling operations in the gom 
diamond offshore believes that it is currently in compliance with the existing regulations set forth by the mms with respect to its operations in the gom  however  these regulations are continually under review 
implementation of additional mms regulations may subject diamond offshore to increased costs of operating  or a reduction in the area and or periods of operation  in the gom 
highmount 
all of highmount s operations are conducted onshore in the united states 
the us oil and gas industry  and highmount s operations  are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level 
such regulation includes requirements with respect to  among other things permits to drill and to conduct other operations  provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations  the location of wells  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  and the valuation and payment of royalties  the size of drilling and spacing units regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area  the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties  maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production 
the conference committee report for the department of the interior  environment  and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year requested the epa to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing  particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water 
hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies  including highmount  to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures  causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely 
in recent years  concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may contaminate underground sources of drinking water 
several bills have been introduced in congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing  which has historically been regulated at the state level  though none of the proposed legislation has moved out of committee 
if hydraulic fracturing is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise  it would have a material adverse effect on highmount s ability to economically drill new natural gas wells  which would materially reduce its production  revenues and profitability 
highmount s operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of contaminants  and the 
table of contents item a 
risk factors protection of public health  natural resources  wildlife and the environment 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products  water and air pollution control procedures  and the remediation of petroleum product contamination 
in addition  highmount s operations may require it to obtain permits for  among other things  air emissions  discharges into surface waters  and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non hazardous oilfield wastes 
boardwalk pipeline 
boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc and the dot among other federal and state authorities 
in addition to ferc rules and regulations related to the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its services  ferc s regulatory authority extends to operating terms and conditions of service  the types of services boardwalk pipeline may offer to its customers  construction of new facilities  creation  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  and relationships with certain types of affiliated companies involved in the natural gas business 
ferc s action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact boardwalk pipeline s ability to compete for business  to construct new facilities  offer new services or to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines 
this regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project 
the federal regulatory approval and compliance process could raise the costs of such projects to the point where they are no longer sufficiently timely or cost competitive when compared to competing projects that are not subject to the federal regulatory regime 
the businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense competition 
each of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition in its industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively 
certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include cna 
all aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services 
cna competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers 
insurers compete on the basis of factors including products  price  services  ratings and financial strength 
cna may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices 
diamond offshore 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which at the present time has a dominant market share 
some of diamond offshore s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than diamond offshore 
the drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation  which could create additional large competitors 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job  although rig availability and location  a drilling contractor s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered 
mergers among oil and gas exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers as well as the contraction of the global economy  increasing competition 
significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition 
diamond offshore believes there are approximately jack up rigs and floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between and the resulting increase in rig supply could result in depressed rig utilization and greater price competition 
highmount 
highmount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business  including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods  services and labor  including drilling rigs and well 
table of contents item a 
risk factors completion services 
highmount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and ngls 
some of highmount s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than highmount 
factors that affect highmount s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and standards established by highmount for minimum projected return on investment 
competition for sales of natural gas and ngls is also presented by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil  imported lng and other fossil fuels 
boardwalk pipeline 
boardwalk pipeline competes with other pipelines to maintain current business levels and to serve new demand and markets 
boardwalk pipeline also competes with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth opportunities 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to supply and flexibility and reliability of service 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where boardwalk pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines  including the rockies express pipeline that transports natural gas from northern colorado to eastern ohio and the mid continent express pipeline that transports natural gas from oklahoma and texas to alabama 
boardwalk pipeline will also directly compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
in addition  regulators continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of boardwalk pipeline s traditional customers 
as a result of the regulators policies  segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with boardwalk pipeline s pipeline services 
additionally  natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the natural gas industry has built  or is in the process of completing  significant new pipeline infrastructure that will support the development of unconventional natural gas supply basins across the us additional pipeline infrastructure projects are being proposed 
these new pipeline developments have increased competition in certain pipeline markets  resulting in lower price differentials between physical locations basis spreads 
basis spreads can impact the rates boardwalk pipeline will be able to negotiate with its customers when contracts come up for renewal 
each year a portion of boardwalk pipeline s capacity becomes subject to re contracting risk 
for example  approximately of boardwalk pipeline s contracts are due to expire in increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by boardwalk pipeline s systems or  in instances where boardwalk pipeline does not have long term contracts with fixed rates  could force boardwalk pipeline to decrease its transportation or storage rates 
the regulatory program that applies to interstate pipelines is different than the regulatory program that applies to many of boardwalk pipeline s competitors that are not regulated interstate pipelines 
this difference in regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete a project when it is regulated at the federal level 
boardwalk pipeline competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over boardwalk pipeline because of the absence of ferc regulation 
in view of potential rate advantages and construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines  boardwalk pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors 
we and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation 
we and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business 
litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in a material expense 
please read information on litigation included in the md a under item and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item certain of the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries are as follows cna 
cna faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and a e matters  which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that it has established 
these matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages 
we and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully 
our success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially depends upon each company s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other qualified employees 
in many instances  there may be only a limited number 
table of contents item a 
risk factors of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and our subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful implementation of our and our subsidiaries business strategies 
diamond offshore has experienced upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the strong drilling market in recent years and has lost experienced personnel to competitors and customers 
as a result  diamond offshore has implemented retention programs  including increases in compensation 
certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws 
certain of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and or financial exposure related to compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years  and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person 
these laws and regulations may expose us and our subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
for example as discussed in more detail above  many of cna s policyholders have made claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters  as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable us waters and some offshore areas  diamond offshore may be liable for  among other things  damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to those operations  including for conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed  the risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in natural gas transportation  gathering and storage  including with respect to  among other things  the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from boardwalk pipeline s facilities  compliance with clean air standards and the abandonment and reclamation of boardwalk pipeline s facilities  sites and other properties  and development  production and sale of natural gas and ngls in the united states are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations  including those related to discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection  permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties and reports concerning operations  which could result in liabilities for personal injuries  property damage  spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages  suspension or termination of highmount s operations and administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change 
as awareness of climate change issues increases  governments around the world are beginning to address the matter 
this may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us  our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers 
we and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas  thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon based fuel and related services or imposing significant new costs 
governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources  such as wind power and solar energy  which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
in addition  changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer term natural catastrophe trends  including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at cna and damage to property  disruption of business and higher operating costs at diamond offshore  boardwalk pipeline  highmount and loews hotels 
there is currently no federal regulation that limits or imposes additional costs with respect to greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the us however  several bills were introduced in congress during that would regulate us ghg emissions under a cap and trade system and some regulation of that type may be enacted in the us in the near future 
in addition  in september  the epa adopted regulations under the clean air act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual ghg emissions by operators of facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghg per year  
table of contents item a 
risk factors which includes boardwalk pipeline beginning in and may include highmount beginning in numerous states and several regional multi state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate ghg emissions  though the state programs vary widely 
the establishment of a ghg reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of ghg emissions 
compliance with future laws and regulations could impose significant costs on affected companies or adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport natural gas and oil  which would adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries 
the economic recession and ongoing financial and credit markets crisis have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the business and financial condition of us and our subsidiaries 
the recent financial and credit crisis has substantially reduced the availability of liquidity and credit available to businesses and consumers worldwide 
the continued shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with substantial losses in equity and fixed income markets  has led to an economic recession in the united states and abroad 
such deterioration of the worldwide economy and credit and capital markets has and may continue to adversely affect the customers of our subsidiaries  including the ability of such customers to perform under contracts 
the recession has also resulted in  and may result in further  reduced demand for certain of the products and services provided by our subsidiaries  including property casualty insurance  natural gas and gas transportation services  offshore drilling services and hotel rooms and related services 
such decline in demand could lead to lower revenues and earnings by our subsidiaries 
we cannot predict if the actions being taken by the united states and other governments around the world to address this situation will be successful in reducing the severity or duration of this recession

table of contents management s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules a f and d f for us 
our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system  however well designed  including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure 
the design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions 
as a result  even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
based on this assessment  our management believes that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
our independent registered public accounting firm  deloitte touche llp  has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report of deloitte touche llp follows this report

the company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by  or under the supervision of  the company s principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  and effected by the company s board of directors  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  the company maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
we have also audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the company s consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december  and our report dated february  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the change in methods of accounting for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  accounting for oil and gas reserves  and accounting for other than temporary impairments
