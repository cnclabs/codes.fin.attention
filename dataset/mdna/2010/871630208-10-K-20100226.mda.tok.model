if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our future plant development and other activities  or seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
we need to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market to be able to access adequate funding from time to time 
we could face de listing issues that would impair the liquidity of our stock and our availability to access the capital markets 
our stock price has remained above per share since march  nasdaq rules call for the potential de listing of a company if its stock trades under per share for consecutive days 
if our stock price declines to below per share again  we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
construction and operations of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to risks of delay and cost overruns 

table of contents the construction and operation of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors  including the following shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  engineering problems  including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  and difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals 
we have incurred losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we achieved profitability from continuing operations in for the first time 
because we do not have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by small companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies 
to address these risks we must  among other things  continue to attract investment capital  respond to competitive factors  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel and commercialize and continue to upgrade the syntroleum and synfining processes and bio synfining technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
our anticipated expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future operating activities and not on historical financial data 
we plan to continue funding project development activities 
capital expenditures will depend on progress we make in developing various projects on which we are currently working 
increased revenues or cash flows may not result from these expenses 
if prices or margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities are unfavorable  plants based on the syntroleum technologies may not be economical 
because the synthetic crude oil  liquid fuels and specialty products that plants utilizing the syntroleum technologies are expected to produce will compete in markets with oil and refined petroleum products  and because natural gas  coal  biomass  fats or vegetable oils will be used as the feedstock for these plants  an increase in feedstock prices relative to prices for oil or refined products  or a decrease in prices for oil or refined products relative to feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
prices for oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  greases  vegetable oils and refined products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
factors that could cause changes in the prices and availability of oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  vegetable oils and refined products include level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulation  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political conditions in countries producing feedstocks for fuels plants  supply of crude oil  natural gas  coal  biomass fats  greases and vegetable oils  location of gtl plants relative to natural gas reserves and pipelines  location of ctl plants relative to coal reserves and transportation systems  location of btl plants relative to biomass reserves and transportation systems  capacities of pipelines  
table of contents fluctuations in seasonal demand  crop yields  seasonality of prices for feedstocks and refined products  farmer planting decisions  output and proximity of crush facilities that convert the crops to oils  alternative uses for fats  number of animals slaughtered and rendered  price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions 
we cannot predict the future markets and prices for oil  natural gas  coal or other materials used in the syntroleum technologies or refined products 
we believe that the syntroleum and synfining processes can be economic for gtl  btl and ctl plants given the current world crude oil prices 
however  the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
crude oil prices could return to such low levels in the future 
our success depends on the performance of our executive officers and key personnel  the loss of who would disrupt our business operations 
we depend to a large extent on the performance of our executive officers  including edward g 
roth  our chief executive officer  karen l 
gallagher  our senior vice president of finance and principal financial officer 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
at december   we had full time employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we have entered into employment agreements with several key employees 
we depend on strategic relationships with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers 
if we are not successful in entering into and achieving the benefits of these relationships  this could negatively impact our business 
our or our licensee s ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  engineering service companies  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers will depend on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants 
our success in this area will also depend on our ability to select and evaluate suitable projects  as well as to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
these relationships may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties or local government bodies  contractual arrangements with other companies  including those that supply feedstock that we will use in our business  or minority investments from third parties 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to establish these strategic relationships  or  if established  that the relationships will be maintained 
in addition  the dynamics of our relationships with strategic participants may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur or undertake in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain these relationships 
if we do not successfully establish or maintain strategic relationships  our business may be negatively affected 
our operating results may be volatile due to a variety of factors and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results because of the unpredictability of many factors that impact our business 
these factors include timing of any construction by us or our licensees of plants  demand for licenses or other technology transfer agreements of the syntroleum technologies and receipt and revenue recognition of license fees  feedstock prices  prices for refined products  demand for synthetic fuels and specialty products  introduction or enhancement of ft and renewable fuels technologies by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new technologies  and general economic conditions 

table of contents as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it may be that in some future year or quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive laws relating to the protection of the environment  and these laws may increase the cost of designing  constructing and operating our plants based on the syntroleum technologies or affect demand for the products of these plants 
if we violate any of the laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  we may be subject to substantial fines  criminal sanctions or third party lawsuits and may be required to install costly pollution control equipment or  in some extreme cases  curtail operations 
our ft and renewable fuels plants will generally be required to obtain permits under applicable environmental laws and various permits for industrial siting and construction 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations  as well as with any requisite environmental or construction permits  may increase the costs of designing  constructing and operating our plants 
we may also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters with respect to our previously owned real estate 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
for instance  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the us congress is actively considering legislation  and more than a dozen states have already taken legal measures to reduce emission of these gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse affect on our operations 
terrorist threats and us military actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere could occur 
these developments and similar future events may cause instability in the world s financial and insurance markets and could significantly increase political and economic instability in the geographic areas in which we may wish to operate 
these developments could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil  natural gas and the feedstocks for our plants and the cost and availability of insurance 
in addition  these developments could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to successfully implement projects currently under development 
united states government regulations effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be amended to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future 
these developments could subject the operations of our company to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry a significant amount of business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance  such as a leak  fire or explosion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item legal proceedings on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher to settle all legal claims arising in connection with the investment agreement the investment agreement dated november   between us and fletcher 
pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement  under which a maximum of million shares could be issued  fletcher agreed to purchase million worth of our stock at floating per share prices over a twenty four month period 
the purchase was divided into an initial investment of million at a premium to the trading price of our stock and later investments totaling million at a discount to the trading price of our stock 
fletcher refused to close on the initial investment at per share  asserting that all of the conditions precedent had not been satisfied  and subsequently attempted to make a later investment of per share 
we refused to close on the grounds that  because fletcher failed to make the initial investment  fletcher was not entitled to go forward with the later investments 
each party subsequently filed legal claims against one another  with syntroleum claiming unspecified damages against fletcher and fletcher claiming damages  excluding legal fees  of million 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  we and fletcher entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement dated october  whereby fletcher purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share and was issued a warrant  exercisable until october   to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds to the company were million  after deducting fees and expenses of the offering payable by us 
under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  fletcher also has the option to purchase  on or before june   an additional  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share  in up to two subsequent closings 
fletcher initiated the initial subsequent closing on december  whereby fletcher purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share and was issued a warrant  exercisable until december   to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our focus is the commercialization of innovative technology to produce synthetic liquid hydrocarbons 
our bio synfining technology processes triglycerides and or fatty acids from fats and vegetable oils with heat  hydrogen and proprietary catalysts to make renewable synthetic fuels  such as diesel  heating oil  jet fuel subject to certification  kerosene  naphtha and propane 
syntroleum has quantified in excess of different fats and oils  which cover the spectrum of both cost and quality  for conversion to synthetic fuels via the bio synfining technology 
operations to date have consisted of activities related to the commercialization of a proprietary process the syntroleum process and previously consisted of research and development of the syntroleum process designed to convert carbonaceous material biomass  coal  natural gas and petroleum coke into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons 
synthetic hydrocarbons produced by the syntroleum process can be further processed using the syntroleum synfining process into high quality liquid fuels 
our bio synfining technology is a renewable fuels application of our synfining technology 
we are centered on being a recognized provider of the bio synfining technology  syntroleum process and synfining product upgrading technology to the energy industry through strategic relationships and deployment of our technology 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from the sale or transfer of our technology with certain restrictions  technical services revenue from engineering service rendered to dynamic fuels for the pdp as well as other engineering services  licensing revenue from marathon  reimbursement for research and development activities associated with the syntroleum process and sales of products for testing purposes 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from engineering technical services  royalties and other income from our jointly owned subsidiary dynamic fuels  sales and licensing of our technologies and product sales or royalties for the use of gtl  btl and ctl plants in which we will own an equity interest 
until the commencement of commercial operation of our dynamic fuels facility located in geismar  louisiana  we expect that cash flow relating to our syntroleum technologies will consist primarily of revenues associated with technical services provided by our engineers and sales and licensing of our technology 
upon commercial operations of our dynamic fuels facility we will receive royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
commercial operations are expected to begin in the second half of we expect to receive additional profits from the operations of the facility based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
we may receive revenues associated with the sale of the use of our technology to certain customers with limited rights in certain geographic areas 
our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial construction and operation of the dynamic fuels facility or other gtl  btl or ctl plants based on the syntroleum process  the success of competing gtl technologies  and other competing uses for natural gas  biomass or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  oils  animal fats  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
if the price of these products increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in operating revenues 
we continue to incur operating expenses with respect to commercializing our syntroleum technologies and do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenue production from the dynamic fuels bio synfining facility until the second half of operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of engineering  including third party engineering  the construction and operation of the catoosa demonstration facility  pilot plant  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 
we have also recognized depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements and patents 
we have reduced our costs and expenses over the past three years with the completion of our research and development efforts related to running the cdf and pilot plant  operating costs declined as a result of suspending operations at both plants  reducing our workforce and focusing on cost minimization 
our current workforce consists of engineers and general and administrative employees 
the implementation of these cost saving measures had a significant favorable impact on our operating expenses and we expect to continue to focus on these cost saving measures on a go forward basis 
we do not expect to rehire any of the employees included in the reductions 
our operating expenses are not expected to increase further within the near future 

table of contents we have incurred costs related specifically to the development and design of the bio synfining and syntroleum process 
these costs  which relate primarily to engineers  outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development are included in engineering costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have invested million of cash into our dynamic fuels bio synfining plant in which we own an interest for our portion of start up and capital expenditures  including working capital for our share of the engineering design  construction and start up of the plant 
upon the commencement of commercial operations of a plant  we will incur our share of initial working capital which includes expenses relating primarily to the cost of feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses relating to the plant  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
due to the substantial capital expenditures associated with the construction of a bio synfining plant  we expect the plant will incur significant depreciation and amortization expense in the future 
commercial and licensee projects on june   we entered into definitive agreements with tyson foods  inc tyson to form a joint venture limited liability company  dynamic fuels  llc  a delaware limited liability company dynamic fuels  to construct facilities in the united states using our bio synfining technology 
the purpose of dynamic fuels is to construct multiple stand alone commercial plants in the united states 
the first facility is being constructed in geismar  louisiana and  based on current estimates  will produce approximately million gallons per year of renewable synthetic products beginning in the llc agreement provides for management and control of dynamic fuels to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally with no llc member exercising control 
it was initially capitalized on july  with million in capital contributed from tyson and million in capital contributions from syntroleum 
the capital and working capital budget for dynamic fuels financing  construction and initial operations of the first plant to use our bio synfining technology is estimated to equal million in total 
dynamic fuels received approval from the louisiana state bond commission to sell million in gulf opportunity tax exempt bonds to partially finance the plant 
these bonds were sold on october   in the amount of million and are due october  syntroleum and tyson have made capital contributions in the amount of million each in and the remaining estimated million in total will be required to be funded in the first half of proceeds debt and equity contributions in millions dynamic fuels synm portion funded proceeds from debt issuance funded equity contributions from members committed equity contributions from members total proceeds debt and equity contributions interest during construction is calculated based on the daily interest rate stated at closing of percent for months 
the interest rate for the bonds is a daily floating interest rate and may change significantly from this amount 
the interest rate as of december  was 
dynamic fuels entered into an interest rate swap whereby it fixed its interest rate at for a period of years with declining swap coverage in the fourth quarter of the bond indenture requires that the bond principal be backed by a stand by letter of credit 
tyson provided a letter of credit guaranteeing the full amount of bonds for dynamic fuels 
we granted tyson warrants in lieu of payment for the guarantee for our portion of the letter of credit 
monthly fees for this letter of credit are paid by tyson 
dynamic fuels reimburses tyson for these monthly fees and are an additional financing cost to dynamic 
this project continues to progress forward 
plant start up is scheduled for the first half of and full rate operations are expected during the third quarter of all major pieces of equipment and reactors have been installed  but the project has encountered construction delays 
the primary reason construction delay has been the installation of piping to connect the installed plant equipment 
the cash impact of the delay has resulted in an additional million in costs to the total project  of which syntroleum must contribute 
this includes increased working capital for operations staff and financing costs that were previously expected to be funded by operations 
both parties have committed to funding the cost overrun in the second quarter of tyson is responsible for supplying feedstock to the plant  either from its own internal sources or from supplies it procures in the open market 
the feedstock supply agreement provides a pricing formula for the feedstock  which is generally equivalent to the market price 
the tyson fat blend feedstock is expected to provide us with a notable cost advantage due to the types of fats to be utilized 
the feedstock slate will be subject to change based upon market availability and other factors 
we currently expect that the first facility will produce approximately diesel  naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases 
we expect that dynamic fuels will be eligible for a federal excise tax credit if extended of per gallon for diesel produced and per gallon for naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases produced 

table of contents discontinued operations research and development our policy is to expense costs associated with the catoosa demonstration facility and pilot plant  and research and development costs as incurred in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic research and development 
all of these research and development expenses were associated with the development of our syntroleum process 
the catoosa demonstration facility expenses previously included costs to maintain and operate the facility for further research and development as well as for demonstrations for licensees and other customers 
the expenses associated with the facility in include certain expenses associated with the mothball state of the facility  primarily rent and utilities associated with the office space 
research and development expenses previously included costs to operate our laboratory and technology center  salaries and wages associated with these operations  research and development services performed by universities  consultants and third parties and additional supplies and equipment for these facilities 
our policy is to expense costs associated with the development of gtl plants or other projects until we begin our pdp and front end engineering and design program on the respective projects 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development of the syntroleum process 
international oil and gas we previously pursued international oil and gas activities  which primarily included the leasehold acquisition  geological and geophysical work covering various areas in nigeria  and drilling costs for the aje discovery well aje in oil mining lease oml offshore nigeria 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our international oil and gas activities due to limited access to capital requirements 
we sold all the stock of various subsidiaries  including syntroleum nigeria limited which held our interests in the ajapa and aje fields offshore nigeria to african energy equity resources limited aeerl  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of energy equity resources norway limited eernl for a total of  results of operations consolidated results for the years ended december  revenues in thousands technology revenue licensing revenue from marathon technical services revenue technical services revenue from dynamic fuels other revenue total revenues technology revenue 
technology revenue was  for the year ended december  and relates to the delivery of technology documents  transference of technology and the sale of certain technology equipment 
technology agreements will be unique to individual customers 
revenue recognition will be determined on an individual contract basis 
we are actively pursuing other agreements 
due to the complexity and due diligence requirements of these agreements  the business development requirements typically span current year timing 
licensing revenue from marathon 
licensing revenue of  for the year ended december  related to the consolidation and license agreement granted to marathon in january of  and the recognition of previously deferred license fee credits of  the new licensing agreement was entered into to settle a convertible debt obligation to marathon for funding a portion of our catoosa demonstration facility 
we do not anticipate receiving additional licensing revenue from marathon in the near term 
technical services revenue 
revenues from engineering services for a pdp for dynamic and other engineering services increased in compared to and revenues 
this increase is attributable to increased technical services contracts related to certain technology revenue agreements and continued work on the engineering design and project management of dynamic fuels 
revenue from dynamic fuels is expected to be significantly less in as the project is nearly completed and the plant is expected to be operational in the second half of we expect to continue to earn revenues for engineering services to other customers on an individual contract basis in 
table of contents other revenue 
other revenues decreased in the year ended december  compared to the same periods last year 
the increased revenue in consisted of gtl fuel sales and recognition of revenue for the completion of the second and third milestone for our work with testing gallons of renewable jet fuel in the amount of  in and  in revenue in also consisted of fuel sales to the department of transportation of approximately  we have sold all of our ft fuel from our demonstration facility and do not expect to recognize future revenues from this revenue source 
operating costs and expenses in thousands engineering depreciation  depletion  amortization non cash equity compensation general and administrative and other total operating costs and expenses engineering expense 
the decrease in expenditures in compared to and consists of decreased salaries due to a lower number of engineers and decreased expenditures associated with outside engineering firms for work on mechanical reactor designs 
non cash equity compensation 
equity compensation expense for the vesting of stock compensation awards to employees increased in compared to and decreased from expense recognized in these changes in expense primarily relate to a reduction in work force resulting in cancellation of awards and new awards granted in the fourth quarter of and valued on the grant date based on underlying stock prices 
the new awards granted to all employees in are performance related and are based on achieving certain milestones associated with the bio synfining technology project 
previously granted awards were also valued at higher prices based on the underlying stock prices of the company at the time of grant and were recognized in most of these awards have been cancelled due to termination of employees or expired 
we expect to recognize the remaining amount of equity compensation for the milestone based awards by june  and will not have significant equity compensation expense for the remainder of the year  unless new awards are granted 
general and administrative and other 
general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in compared to from our cost reduction plan which included decreased expenditures associated with overhead personnel  professional consultants  accountant fees  travel and insurance expenditures 
the company has not increased expenditures for any of these items in compared to the increase in general and administrative expenses in primarily related to legal fees from ongoing litigation with fletcher and for bonus compensation for the execution and delivery of technology document agreements 
the litigation with fletcher was settled in the fourth quarter of and we expect to see a decrease in legal fees from the conclusion of this litigation and decreased general and administrative fees in other income and expenses in thousands interest income other income expense loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc foreign currency exchange minority interest income taxes income loss from discontinued operations interest income 
the decrease in interest income over the years is due to declining interest rates on money market funds 
a majority of interest income is generated from money market accounts with our current cash balances 
loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc 
loss from our investment in dynamic fuels increased due to initial start up operating expenditures 
expenditures incurred for the year ended september  include site rent  project development  site selection  equipment evaluation and labor expenditures for operations staff 
in anticipation of plant operation in  expenditures incurred for dynamic fuels total approximately  for the twelve months ended september  approximately  is attributable to the expense associated with marking the dynamic fuels interest rate swap to market 
the swap is discussed in commercial and licensee projects 
the joint venture capitalizes costs associated with the construction of the plant and we expect to see income from this investment in upon the start up of commercial operations 
we report our percent share of dynamic fuels results of operations on a three month lag basis 
foreign currency exchange 
changes in the foreign currency exchange are due to fluctuation in the value of the australian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the foreign currency changes result from translation adjustments from our license with the commonwealth of australia which is denominated in australian dollars 
these changes have no current cash impact on us 

table of contents income loss from discontinued operations 
changes in income from discontinued operation primarily resulted from oil and gas proceeds received in the amount of  from the settlement of future payments that would have been calculated on first gross revenues from our international oil and gas assets in  and international oil and gas gains of  recognized for the sale of stock in our nigerian subsidiary for our interests in aje and ajapa assets in research and development decrease in expenditures for research and development activities associated with the demonstration plants due to mothballing of plants or leasing agreements in and the large increase in is with laboratory facilities  personnel and termination expenditures in  as well as operations of demonstration plants in  and a onetime gain in resulting from the extinguishment of debt related to the marathon note for the construction of the demonstration facility in the amount of  contributed to the income recognized in  we will not incur further expenses related to our oil and gas activities in the future 
we will not incur significant expenses related to our research and development activities in the future as all liabilities associated with the discontinuance of activities have been incurred in liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
at december  we had  in accounts receivable outstanding relating to our technology transfer agreements and our technical services revenue provided to dynamic fuels and other revenue 
we believe that all of the receivables currently outstanding will be collected and have not established a reserve for bad debts 
our current liabilities totaled  as of december  our business plan over the next several years includes potential investments in additional plants and we will need to raise additional capital to accomplish this plan 
we expect to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financing in the capital markets  joint ventures  license agreements and other strategic alliances  as well as various other financing arrangements 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing might be available 
assuming the commercial success of the plants based on the syntroleum process  we expect that license fees  catalyst sales and sales of products from plants in which we own an interest will be a source of revenues 
in addition  we could receive revenues from other commercial projects we are pursuing 
if we are unable to generate funds from operations  our need to obtain funds through financing activities will be increased 
cash flows vs 
cash flows provided by operations was  during the year ended december  compared to cash flows used in operations of  during the year ended december  the increase in cash flows provided by operations primarily results from the collection of revenues from technology transfer agreements of  and engineering technical services 
cash flows used in investing activities were  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  we invested  in dynamic fuels in april of and have committed to an additional  investment in the first half of we expect to utilize cash flows provided by operations for this investment 
the cash used in investing activities in included a  investment into dynamic fuels 
this investment was offset by the sale of assets associated with our discontinued operations such as  receipt of payments from aaerl of  and the proceeds from the sale of the technology center of  we do not have any other assets for sale related to our discontinued operations 
cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was  compared to in the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities is primarily due to net proceeds received from our stock purchase agreement with fletcher 
fletcher purchased  shares of our common stock at a stock price of approximately in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents vs 
cash flows used in operations were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows used in operations of  during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows used in operations primarily results from lower cash used in continuing operations based on the new cost structure implemented by our management team in  increased cash revenues and the receipt of a non refundable advance payment of  recorded as deferred revenue 
we also decreased our cash used in discontinued operations of research and development activities in when compared to cash flows used in investing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of  during the year ended december  the change was primarily related to the capital contribution to our joint venture  dynamic fuels for initial construction costs in the amount of  this investment is offset by the sale of assets associated with our discontinued operations as stated above of  cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended december  was compared to  provided by financing activities during the year ended december  the change in cash flows was primarily due to net proceeds received from a draw down of  under our common stock purchase agreement offset by the payment of liabilities associated with our international oil and gas assets 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations capital investments asset retirement obligations total our operating leases include leases for corporate headquarters and copiers 
we have entered into employment agreements  which provide severance cash benefits to several key employees 
commitments under these agreements totaled approximately  at december  expense is not recognized until an employee is severed 
the capital and working capital budget for dynamic fuels financing  construction and initial operations of the first plant to use the company s bio synfining technology is estimated to equal million 
dynamic fuels received approval from the louisiana state bond commission to sell million in gulf opportunity zone tax exempt bonds to partially finance the plant 
these bonds were sold on october   in the amount of million 
syntroleum and tyson have made capital contributions in the amount of million each in and the remaining estimated million each will be required to be funded in the first half of we expect to fund the remaining commitment from available cash 
the plant is expected to begin commercial operations by the third quarter of equity issuances on october   we and fletcher entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement whereby fletcher purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share and was issued a warrant  exercisable until october   to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
fletcher initiated the initial subsequent closing on december  whereby fletcher purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share and was issued a warrant  exercisable until december   to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting fees and expenses of the offering payable by us 
fletcher may purchase up to  in a final subsequent closing and will receive a warrant  exercisable for a period of six years  to purchase the number of shares of our common stock equal to the product of times the number of shares of our common stock purchased in such subsequent closing  with an exercise price of approximately per share 

table of contents as an incentive to tyson for entering the dynamic fuels limited liability company agreement  tyson received warrants to buy our common stock 
the warrants are allocated in three tranches 
the first tranche of million shares was awarded upon signing of the llc agreement  feedstock and master license agreements in june the warrant agreement provides that the second tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the second plant and the third tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the third plant  provided that tyson has at least a interest in dynamic fuels 
the exercise price of the first tranche of million warrants is per share  which was the ten day average closing price prior to the signing of the above referenced agreements on june  the exercise price of the second and third tranches of warrants will be the ten day average closing price prior to the sanctioning of plants or vesting requires that tyson remain at least a equity owner in dynamic fuels in the case of the first tranche and in the applicable plant in the case of the second and third tranches  and that each plant has commenced commercial operation 
maturity of each tranche of warrants will be on the third anniversary of each respective plant s start up date of commercial operations 
if or more of the project cost for the third plant is debt financed  then the third warrant tranche will not vest 
in the event that tyson owns a or greater interest in dynamic fuels the number of shares subject to the second and third warrant tranche doubles subject to a limitation that tyson will not receive pursuant to all tranches  warrants for stock equal to or more than of the outstanding shares of syntroleum common stock 
in the event tyson defaults by not paying its capital contributions to the plant  tyson loses the warrants for such plant 
on june   we and tyson entered into a warrant agreement providing for the issuance of warrants to tyson to purchase shares of our common stock in exchange for credit support relating to the obligations of dynamic fuels under the gulf opportunity zone tax exempt bonds  go zone bonds 
tyson agreed under the terms of the warrant agreement to provide credit support for our share of the guarantee 
tyson received million fully vested warrants to purchase the company s common stock at an exercise price of on october  upon providing the credit support upon the issuance of the go zone bonds 
the warrants were exercised on april  pursuant to two registration rights agreements  we have granted tyson demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrants 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
the guidance requires entities to provide more information about sales of securitized financial assets and similar transactions  particularly if the seller retains some risk to the assets 
the guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for the de recognition of financial assets  and calls upon sellers of the assets to make additional disclosures about them 
the guidance is effective for new transfers of financial assets occurring in fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
the implementation of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance that amended the existing criteria for consolidating variable interest entities vies 
the new consolidation criteria will require an ongoing qualitative assessment of which entity has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of a vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the implementation of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  we adopted the fasb statement on generally accepted accounting principles gaap relating to the fasb accounting standards codification 
this standard establishes the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe that the following items represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from technical services provided as time and expenses for services or support associated with a contract or license are incurred 
the license agreements require us to develop a technology design and other technical services in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the process design package or pdp 
technical service revenues primarily resulted from the preparation of our pdp to dynamic fuels in  and the preparation of our pdp includes engineering labor and necessary materials for completion of the package 

table of contents we recognize revenues from the transfer of technology documentation to customers or through licensing structures 
any deposits or advance payments for the technology documentation is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes revenue on the transfer of technology documentation upon the physical transfer of the technology documentation by the company to the customer pursuant to the terms of the specific agreement 
license fee deposits received as cash upon the sale of master volume or regional license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue on the sale of license agreements by recording percent of the license fee deposit as revenue when a site license agreement has been formally executed  the license fee deposit has been paid in cash and delivery to the licensee the pdp for the licensee s initial plant 
since percent of the license fee deposit is subject to our indemnity obligation with respect to the performance guarantee on the related plant  the remaining license fee deposit will be recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations after the related plant has passed certain performance tests 
option fees  which provide licensees the right to include additional geographic areas in its license agreement territory  are deferred until the earlier of the option being exercised or lapsing 
the license agreements currently allow us to use our own engineering staff or to work with outside engineering contractors to develop a site specific plant design in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the pdp 
to date  we have not delivered any pdp s for initial licensed plants  except for the dynamic fuels plant  which we are part owner of and no initial license fee deposits are required 
we are under no obligation to return these deferred revenues except in the case when a licensee builds a plant and the plant does not pass certain performance tests 
in this situation  the licensee would be able to receive a refund of percent of the license fees paid 
the license agreements have a year life and  after this time  the deferred revenue will be recorded as license revenue in the statements of operations unless a site license has been executed 
our current licenses generally begin to expire in and the initial deposits will be recognized as licensing revenue as the licenses expire should the licensee not purchase a site license and begin construction of a plant prior to expiration of the license 
we have not received additional funds under these license agreements during the license period and do not expect to receive additional funds under these license agreements 
we are currently pursuing different avenues for the sale of technology rights  via equity ownership or sale or transfer of technology  and have not entered into this type of license agreement since preparation of the pdp can take varying amounts of time depending on the size of the project and could take a period of time  ranging six months to two years from notice to proceed 
construction time will depend on the size of the project  site location conditions and the availability of construction services  necessary materials and labor 
current estimates for construction times for large capital projects in excess of one billion dollars in costs are from three to five years from completion of the front end engineering design 
we expect to recognize revenue for royalty fees associated with our licensees plants or our own equity owned plants 
the royalties will be recognized upon production of finished product by the licensee 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally three years using the straight line method 
non employee stock based compensation 
we also grant stock based incentives to certain non employees 
these stock based incentives are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
stock awards that are tied to performance criteria are expensed at the time the performance goals are met 
asset retirement obligations 
we follow fasb asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the standard requires that we record the discounted fair value of the retirement obligation as a liability at the time the plants are constructed 
the asset retirement obligations consist primarily of costs associated with the future plant dismantlement of our pilot plants 
as the pilot plants are directly related to research and development activities and have been expensed accordingly  no corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the related property s carrying amount 
the liability accretes over time with a charge to accretion expense 
critical estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management include  but are not limited to  the valuation of stock based compensation  estimates for accrued liabilities and estimates for asset retirement obligations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities create a market risk for economics associated with our syntroleum technologies 
because the synthetic crude oil  liquid fuels and specialty products that plants utilizing the syntroleum technologies are expected to produce will compete in markets with oil and refined petroleum products  and because natural gas  coal  biomass  fats or vegetable oils will be used as the feedstock for these plants  an increase in feedstock prices relative to prices for oil or refined products  or a decrease in prices for oil or refined products relative to feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
prices for oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  greases  vegetable oils and refined products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to accomplish our business plan over the next several years 
we expect to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financing in the capital markets  joint ventures  license agreements  sale of assets and other strategic alliances  as well as various other financing arrangements 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 
foreign exchange risk currently relates to deferred revenue  a portion of which is denominated in australian dollars 
financial statement assets and liabilities may be translated at prevailing exchange rate and may result in gains or losses in current income 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations applicable to transactions denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the portion of deferred revenue denominated in australian currency was us  at december  the deferred revenue is converted to us dollars for financial reporting purposes at the end of every reporting period 
to the extent that conversion results in gains or losses  such gains or losses will be reflected in our statements of operations 
the exchange rate of the australian dollar to the united states dollar was and at december  and december   respectively 
we do not have any purchased futures contracts or any derivative financial instruments  other than warrants issued to purchase common stock at a fixed price in connection with consulting agreements  private placements and other equity offerings
