item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides management s discussion of chesapeake and its consolidated subsidiaries  with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources  as well as discussion on how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
it includes management s interpretation of financial results of the company and its operating segments  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results  investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report  or otherwise made by or on behalf of us  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased cost of natural gas  electricity and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated energy operations and under its competitive pricing structure for unregulated natural gas marketing and propane distribution operations 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
in addition  certain information is presented  which excludes for comparison purposes  result of operations of fpu for the period from the merger closing october  to december  and all merger related costs incurred in connection with the fpu merger 
although the non gaap measures are not intended to replace the gaap measures for evaluation of chesapeake s performance  we believe that the portions of the presentation which excludes fpu s financial results for the post merger period and merger related costs provide a helpful comparative basis for investors to understand chesapeake s performance 
a introduction chesapeake is a diversified utility company engaged  directly or through subsidiaries  in regulated energy businesses  unregulated energy businesses  and other unregulated businesses  including advanced information services 
our strategy is focused on growing earnings from a stable utility foundation and investing in related businesses and services that provide opportunities for returns greater than traditional utility returns 
the key elements of this strategy include executing a capital investment program in pursuit of organic growth opportunities that generate returns equal to or greater than our cost of capital  expanding the regulated energy distribution and transmission businesses through expansion into new geographic areas and providing new services in our current service territories  expanding the propane distribution business in existing and new markets through leveraging our community gas system services and our bulk delivery capabilities  utilizing our expertise across our various businesses to improve overall performance  enhancing marketing channels to attract new customers  providing reliable and responsive customer service to retain existing customers  chesapeake utilities corporation form k page

b highlights and recent developments on october   we completed the previously announced merger with fpu 
as a result of the merger  fpu became a wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake 
the merger allowed us to become a larger energy company serving approximately  customers in the mid atlantic and florida markets  which is twice the number of energy customers we served previously 
the merger increased our overall presence in florida by adding approximately  natural gas distribution customers and  propane distribution customers to our existing natural gas and propane distribution operations in florida 
it also introduces us to the electric distribution business as it incorporates fpu s approximately  electric customers in northwest and northeast florida 
total consideration paid by chesapeake in the merger was approximately million  which included approximately  paid in cash and  shares of common stock issued at a price per share of 
net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger was estimated at million 
this resulted in a purchase premium of million  which was reflected as goodwill 
all of the purchase premium paid in the merger was related to the regulated energy segment 
chesapeake also incurred approximately million in merger related costs related to consummating the merger  merger related litigation costs and costs incurred in integrating operations of the two companies 
as we intend to seek recovery through future rates of the premium paid and merger related costs we incurred  we have deferred approximately million of the merger related costs as a regulatory asset as of december  our net income for was million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for these results include approximately million in costs expensed in and million in costs related to our initial merger discussions with fpu  which were terminated in the results also include approximately million in net income contributed by fpu for the period from the merger closing october  to december  excluding these merger related items and net income contributed by fpu  our net income would have been million and million  or per share diluted and per share diluted  in and  respectively 
the following is a summary of key factors affecting our businesses and their impacts on our results 
more detailed discussion and analysis are provided in the results of operations section 
weather 
weather in was seven percent colder than and six percent colder than normal on the delmarva peninsula 
we estimate that colder weather contributed approximately million in additional gross margin for our regulated energy and unregulated energy operations on the delmarva peninsula in compared to growth 
customer growth continued to be affected by current economic conditions 
despite the slowdown in growth in the region  our delaware and maryland natural gas distribution divisions achieved customer growth in compared to  which contributed million in gross margin for the year 
chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division experienced a net customer loss in  which resulted in a gross margin decrease of  a loss of three large industrial customers in florida in late and contributed primarily to this gross margin decrease 
our natural gas transmission subsidiary  esng  experienced continued growth in through new transmission services and new expansion facilities 
new firm services to an industrial customer in contributed  to esng s gross margin in and are expected to contribute approximately million to its gross margin in new system expansions in november and also contributed  to its gross margin growth in page chesapeake utilities corporation form k 
table of contents propane prices 
a sharp decline in propane prices in late resulted in inventory and swap valuation adjustments of million in  but allowed our delmarva propane distribution operation to keep its propane cost low during the first half of the absence of similar inventory valuation adjustments in and increased margin generated from the low propane cost during the first half of  coupled with sustained retail prices  contributed to increased gross margin of million in compared to for the delmarva propane distribution operation 
overall lack of volatility in wholesale propane prices reduced opportunities for our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  xeron  and decreased its trading volume by percent in compared to  which reduced its gross margin by approximately million 
natural gas spot sale opportunities 
our unregulated natural gas marketing subsidiary  pesco  was able to identify various spot sale opportunities in  which contributed significantly to the overall gross margin increase of million in during  pesco sold natural gas and services of million to valero for its delaware city refinery operation 
late in  valero announced its intention to permanently shut down that refinery 
while pesco s sale to valero in represented approximately percent of pesco s total revenue for the year  spot sales are not predictable  and  therefore  are not included in our long term financial plans or forecasts  nor do we anticipate sales to valero in the future 
rates and regulatory matters 
in july  chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division filed with the florida psc its petition for a rate increase 
in august  the florida psc approved an interim rate increase of approximately  in december  the florida psc approved a permanent rate increase of approximately million  applicable to all meters read on or after january  in december  fpu s natural gas distribution operation settled its request for a permanent rate increase  which had been approved by the florida psc in may  however in june  certain parts of the order approving the increase were protested by the office of public counsel 
the settlement allows an annual rate increase of approximately million for fpu s natural gas distribution operations 
information technology spending 
the state of the economy continued to affect overall information technology spending in our advanced information services subsidiary  bravepoint  continued to experience lower consulting revenues as billable consulting hours declined by percent in compared to we implemented cost containment actions  including layoffs and compensation adjustments  which reduced operating costs in by million 
bravepoint s professional database monitoring and support solution services  added  to its gross margin in interest rates 
we continued to experience low short term interest rates throughout as our short term weighted average interest rate decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the level of our short term borrowings in was reduced by the placement of million of percent unsecured senior notes in october and a decline in working capital requirements due to lower commodity prices  lower trading volume by the propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  lower income tax payments from bonus depreciation and the timing of our capital expenditures 
c critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since most of our businesses are regulated and the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been discussed with our audit committee 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  we record certain assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  regulated operations  consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated energy businesses differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note a  summary of accounting policies  we have recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million  at december  if we were required to terminate application of this topic  we would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note o  environmental commitments and contingencies  we have completed our responsibilities related to one environmental site and are currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of seven other former manufactured gas plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts  because the united states environmental protection agency epa  or other applicable state environmental authority  may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
since we believe that recovery of these expenditures  including any litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  we have recorded a regulatory asset and corresponding environmental liability 
at december   we have recorded an environmental regulatory asset of million and a liability of million for environmental costs 
derivatives we use derivative and non derivative instruments to manage the risks related to obtaining adequate supplies and the price fluctuations of natural gas  electricity and propane 
we also use derivative instruments to engage in propane marketing activities 
we continually monitor the use of these instruments to ensure compliance with our risk management policies and account for them in accordance with appropriate gaap 
if these instruments do not meet the definition of derivatives or are considered normal purchases and sales  they are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of our use of derivative instruments at december  and during and  our natural gas distribution  electric distribution  propane distribution and natural gas marketing operations entered into physical contracts for purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity and propane 
these contracts either did not meet the definition of derivatives as they did not have a minimum requirement to purchase sell or were considered normal purchases and sales as they provided for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity or propane to be delivered in quantities expected to be used and sold by our operations over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  these contracts were accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting 
during  the propane distribution operation entered into a swap agreement to protect it from the impact of price increases on the pro cap propane price cap plan that we offer to customers 
the propane prices declined significantly in late and we recorded a mark to market adjustment of approximately  which increased our cost of propane sales in in january  we terminated this swap agreement 
during  we purchased a put option related to the pro cap plan  which we accounted for on a mark to market basis and recorded a loss of  page chesapeake utilities corporation form k 
table of contents xeron  our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  enters into forward  futures and other contracts that are considered derivatives 
these contracts are marked to market  using prices at the end of each reporting period  and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as revenue or expense 
these contracts generally mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities 
for the years ended december  and  these contracts had net unrealized losses of million and net unrealized gains of million  respectively 
operating revenues revenues for our natural gas and electric distribution operations are based on rates approved by the pscs of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the natural gas transmission operation s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
the pscs  however  have authorized our regulated operations to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
the ferc has also authorized esng to negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved maximum rates  which customers can elect as a recourse to negotiated rates 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas and electricity  we read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we accrue unbilled revenues for natural gas and electricity that have been delivered  but not yet billed  at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
in connection with this accrual  we must estimate amounts of natural gas and electricity that have not been accounted for on our delivery systems and must estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers  and natural gas marketing customers  whose billing cycles do not coincide with the accounting periods 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity for open contracts on a net mark to market basis in our income statement 
for certain propane distribution customers without meters and advanced information services customers  we record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
each of our natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland  our bundled natural gas distribution service in florida and our electric distribution operation in florida has a purchased fuel cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides us with a method of adjusting billing rates to customers to reflect changes in the cost of purchased fuel 
the difference between the current cost of fuel purchased and the cost of fuel recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered purchased fuel costs or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
we charge flexible rates to industrial interruptible customers on our natural gas distribution systems to compete with the price of alternative fuel that they can use 
neither the company nor its interruptible customers is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas on a firm service basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences  the condition of the overall economy and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas  electricity and propane prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected returns on plan assets  assumed discount rates  the level of contributions made to the plans  current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rates and the expected returns on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on the pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rates  the assumed health care cost trend rates and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
additional information is presented in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note m  employee benefit plans  including plan asset investment allocation  estimated future benefit payments  general descriptions of the plans  significant assumptions  the impact of certain changes in assumptions  and significant changes in estimates 
the total pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in operating income were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company expects to record pension and postretirement benefit costs in the range of  to million for of which  is attributed to fpu s pension and medical plans 
actuarial assumptions affecting include expected long term rates of return on plan assets of percent and percent for chesapeake s pension plan and fpu s pension plan  respectively  and discount rates of percent and percent for chesapeake s plan and fpu s plan  respectively 
the discount rate for each plan was determined by management considering high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  the citigroup yield curve  changes in those rates from the prior year  and other pertinent factors  such as the expected lives of the plans and the lump sum payment option 
acquisition accounting the merger with fpu was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting  with chesapeake treated as the acquirer 
the acquisition method of accounting requires  among other things  that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger be recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
it also establishes that the consideration transferred be measured at the closing date of the merger at the then current market price 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in addition  market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and fair value measures for an asset assume the highest and best use by those market participants  rather than our intended use of those assets 
many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is also possible that others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts 
in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation  we considered the nature and impact of regulations on those assets and liabilities as a factor in determining their appropriate fair value 
we also considered the existence of a regulatory process that would allow  or sometimes require  regulatory assets and liabilities to be established to offset the fair value adjustment to certain assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation 
if a regulatory asset or liability should be established to offset the fair value adjustment based on the current regulatory process  as was the case for fuel contracts and long term debt  we did not gross up our balance sheet to reflect the fair value adjustment and corresponding regulatory asset liability  because such gross up would not have resulted in a change to the value of net assets and future earnings of the company 
total consideration paid by chesapeake in the merger was million 
net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger was estimated to be million 
this resulted in a purchase premium of million  which was reflected as goodwill 
item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note b  acquisitions and dispositions describes more fully the purchase price allocation 
page chesapeake utilities corporation form k 
table of contents the acquisition method of accounting also requires acquisition related costs to be expensed in the period in which those costs are incurred  rather than including them as a component of consideration transferred 
it also prohibits an accrual of certain restructuring costs at the time of the merger for the acquiree 
as we intend to seek recovery in future rates in florida of a certain portion of the purchase premium paid and merger related costs incurred  we also considered the impact of asc topic  regulated operations  in determining proper accounting treatment for the merger related costs 
during  we incurred approximately million to consummate the merger  including the cost associated with merger related litigation  and to integrate operations following the merger 
we deferred approximately million of the total costs incurred as a regulatory asset at december   which represents our best estimate  based on similar proceedings in florida in the past  of the costs  which we expect to be permitted to recover when we complete the appropriate rate proceedings 
the remaining million in costs have been expensed in our results 
d results of operations in thousands except per share increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease business segment regulated energy unregulated energy other operating income other income interest charges income taxes net income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income diluted earnings loss per share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted earnings per share as a result of the merger with fpu in  we changed our operating segments to better align with how the chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer views the various operations of the company 
we revised the segment information for all periods presented to reflect the new operating segments 
also during  we decided not to allocate merger related costs to our operating segments for the purpose of reporting their operating profitability  because such costs are not directly attributable to their operations 
consequently  all of the million and million of merger related costs expensed in and  respectively  are included in other segment 
compared to our net income increased by approximately million in compared to net income was million  or per share diluted  for  compared to million  or per share diluted  for our results include approximately million in net income from fpu for the period from the merger closing october  to december  our results also include approximately million of merger related costs expensed by the company  compared to million in merger related costs expensed in absent the effect of the merger and merger related costs  we estimate that net income would have been million  or per share diluted  in  compared to million  or per share diluted  in during  chesapeake incurred approximately million related to consummating the merger  merger related litigation costs and costs of integrating operations of the two companies 
new accounting standards applicable to acquisitions  which became effective in  require companies to expense merger related costs in the periods in which they are incurred 
under the previous accounting standards  most of these merger related costs would have been considered a part of purchase price or liabilities assumed at the merger and thus not expensed 
in accounting for our merger related costs  we also considered the potential impact of the future regulatory process as we intend to seek recovery in future rates of the premium paid and merger related costs incurred 
similar recovery treatment has been pursued successfully by other regulated utilities 
as we account for our regulated operations in accordance with asc topic  regulated operations  certain costs that would otherwise have been expensed by unregulated enterprises may be deferred to reflect the potential impact of the regulatory and rate making actions 
with regard to the million in merger related costs incurred in  we deferred approximately million as a regulatory asset  which represents our estimate  based on similar proceedings in florida in the past  of the costs that we expect to be permitted to recover when we complete the appropriate rate proceedings

these costs were related to our initial merger discussions with fpu  which were terminated in the second quarter of our operating income increased by million in compared to included in operating income for and are the million and million merger related costs expensed in and  respectively  which are included in the other segments 
operating income from our regulated energy segment increased by million in this increase is attributed to million of fpu operating income for the period after the merger and an increase in operating income from the natural gas transmission operations through continued growth and new services 
offsetting those increases was a decrease in operating income from chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution operation as a result of lower than expected customer growth and loss of industrial customers 
operating income for our unregulated energy segment increased by million  which includes  in operating income from fpu after the merger 
the delmarva propane distribution operation contributed most of the increase in operating income by this segment 
delmarva propane distribution operation recorded million in unfavorable propane inventory and swap valuation adjustments in  which did not recur in these adjustments to the inventory costs in late and relatively low propane prices during the first half of allowed the delmarva propane distribution operation to maintain low propane inventory costs while sustaining its retail margins 
operating income for the other segment decreased by million  primarily due to lower operating results by the advanced information services operation and higher merger related costs expensed in the operating results of the advanced information services operation continued to be negatively affected by the lower levels of information technology spending experienced in the economy at large 
during  we recognized increased corporate overhead costs of million compared to  which were allocated to all of our segments 
payroll and benefits costs in corporate overhead increased by  and  respectively  due to higher incentive compensation based on improved operating results and increased costs associated with filling several key corporate positions in and also contributing to the increase were additional costs associated with investor relations and financial reporting activities and increased pension costs as a result of a decline in the value of pension investments in late an increase of  in interest charges in compared to partially offset the increased operating results 
this increase reflects primarily the interest expense on fpu s long term debt and customer deposits and the placement of the million unsecured senior notes in october we continued to invest in property  plant and equipment in to support current and future growth opportunities  expending million for such purposes

a two percent residential customer growth experienced by the delmarva natural gas distribution operation in was lower than the growth experienced in recent years and we expect that trend to continue in the near future

chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution operation experienced a decrease in gross margin of  in this decrease was attributable to reduced consumption by residential and non residential customers and loss of three industrial customers  one in and two in  due to adverse economic conditions in the region 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase to gross margin of  due to implementation of interim rates in the third quarter of the natural gas transmission operations achieved gross margin growth of million in the factors contributing to this increase are as follows new long term transmission services implemented by esng in november of and  which provided for an additional  mcfs per day and  mcfs per day  respectively  added  to gross margin in new firm transmission services provided to an industrial customer for the period of february  through october   provided for an additional  mcfs per day and added  to gross margin

this agreement contributed  to gross margin in other operating expenses other operating expenses for the regulated energy segment increased by million  of which million was related to other operating expenses of fpu for the period from the merger closing october  to december  the remaining increase in other operating expenses is due primarily to the following factors depreciation expense  asset removal costs and property taxes  collectively  increased by approximately million as a result of our continued capital investments to support customer growth 
depreciation expense for also includes a  depreciation credit as a result of the delaware negotiated rate settlement agreement in the third quarter of  of which  related to depreciation for the months of october through december salaries and incentive compensation increased by  due primarily to compensation adjustments implemented on january  for non executive employees  based on a compensation survey completed in the fourth quarter of  and annual salary increases  coupled with a slight increase in the accrual for incentive compensation

these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell natural gas liquids at a fixed price at fixed future dates

booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment or receipt of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price  however  they may also be settled by physical receipt or delivery of propane 
the forward and futures contracts are entered into for trading and wholesale marketing purposes 
the propane wholesale marketing business is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for natural gas liquids deviate from fixed contract settlement prices 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts is monitored daily for compliance with our risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed daily by our oversight officials

table of contents our natural gas distribution  electric distribution and natural gas marketing operations have entered into agreements with natural gas and electricity suppliers to purchase natural gas and electricity for resale to their customers 
purchases under these contracts either do not meet the definition of derivatives or are considered normal purchases and sales and are accounted for on an accrual basis 
i competition our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operation compete with other forms of energy including natural gas  electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
our natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements  and our interruptible sales volumes may decline 
oil prices  as well as the prices of other fuels  fluctuate for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations 
as a result of the transmission operation s conversion to open access and chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  these businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transmission and contract storage services 
our electric distribution operation currently does not face substantial competition as the electric utility industry in florida has not been deregulated 
in addition  natural gas is the only viable alternative fuel to electricity in our electric service territories and is available only in a small area 
our natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on our distribution systems  we are competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  our competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass our existing distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  our distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
we expect to continue to expand the availability of unbundled transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
we have also established a natural gas marketing operation in florida  delaware and maryland to provide such service to customers eligible for unbundled transportation services 
our propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their respective geographic markets  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing responsive and reliable service 
our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors  whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
the advanced information services business faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does the company 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  and could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price

in the regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations  fluctuations in natural gas and electricity prices are passed on to customers through the fuel cost recovery mechanism in our tariffs

to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  we adjust propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
