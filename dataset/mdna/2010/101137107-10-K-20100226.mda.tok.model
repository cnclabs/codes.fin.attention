item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item of this annual report 
introduction boston scientific corporation is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties 
our business strategy is to lead global markets for less invasive medical devices by developing and marketing innovative products  services and therapies that address unmet patient needs  provide superior clinical outcomes and demonstrate compelling value 
in the first quarter of  we completed the divestiture of certain non strategic businesses 
our operating results for the year ended december  include a full year of results of these businesses 
our operating results for the year ended december  include the results of these businesses through the date of separation 
we are involved in several post closing separation activities through transition service agreements  some from which we continued to generate net sales during many of these transition service agreements expired throughout and the remainder will be completed during the first half of refer to the restructuring initiatives section and note f divestitures to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a description of these business divestitures 
executive summary financial highlights and trends our net sales in were billion  which included net sales from divested businesses of million  as compared to net sales of billion in  which included net sales from divested business of million  an increase of million  or two percent 
foreign currency fluctuations decreased our net sales by million in  as compared to excluding the impact of foreign currency and net sales from divested businesses  our net sales increased million  or four percent  as compared to the prior year 
worldwide net sales in our cardiac rhythm management crm group increased million  or five percent in  as compared to excluding the negative impact of foreign currency  our worldwide crm group net sales increased seven percent 
this increase was driven by the continued success of our next generation cognis cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator crt d and our teligen implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd systems  launched in the us  our europe middle east africa emea region and certain inter continental countries in and in japan in  as well as growing adoption of our altrua family of pacemaker systems  launched worldwide during in addition  worldwide net sales of our coronary stent systems increased million  or two percent  on the success of our two drug platform strategy and industry leadership for the widest range of coronary stent sizes 
we are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy  which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the worldwide drug eluting stent market 
worldwide net sales from our endoscopy business grew million  or seven percent  achieving net sales of billion in  on the continued success of our biliary and hemostasis franchises 
worldwide net sales from our urology women s health business grew million  or six percent  due primarily to several successful product launches within our women s health franchise during the year 
our neuromodulation division increased worldwide net sales million  or percent  in  as compared to  as a result of the continued adoption of our precision spinal cord stimulation system 
net sales from our neurovascular business decreased million  or three percent  in  as compared to  
table of contents but are expected to benefit from upcoming product launches in refer to the business and market overview and results of operations sections for discussion of our net sales by division and region 
our reported net loss in was billion  or per share  on approximately billion weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to a net loss in of billion  or per share  also on billion weighted average shares outstanding 
our reported results for included intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related net charges  and discrete tax items of billion after tax  or per share  consisting of million million pre tax of intangible asset impairment charges  million million pre tax  of purchased research and development charges associated with the acquisition of certain technology rights  million million pre tax of gains on the sale of non strategic investments and other credits associated with prior period divestitures of non strategic businesses  million million pre tax of costs associated with our restructuring plan and plant network optimization program  billion billion pre tax of net charges associated with various litigation matters  and million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related charges 
on february   we announced the settlement of three patent litigation matters with johnson johnson for billion  plus interest 
we have accounted for this settlement as of december  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
refer to the results of operations section and note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
our reported results for included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related net charges  and discrete tax items of billion after tax  or per share  consisting of billion  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  of goodwill impairment charges  associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation  million million pre tax of other intangible asset impairment charges  a million gain million pre tax related to the receipt of an acquisition related milestone from abbott laboratories  million million pre tax of net purchased research and development charges  associated primarily with our acquisitions of labcoat  ltd 
and cryocor  inc  million of costs million pre tax associated with our restructuring plan and plant network optimization program  a million net gain million pre tax  associated with the sale of certain non strategic businesses and investments  million of litigation related charges million pre tax resulting primarily from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by johnson johnson  and million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition  divestiture  litigation  and restructuring related charges 
during the fourth quarter of  the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation 
the impact of economic conditions  and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets  on our risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  along with reductions in market demand for products in our us crm reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of our acquisition of guidant  were the key factors contributing to the 
table of contents impairment charge 
refer to note e goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information 
cash generated by operating activities was million in and billion in  and continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth 
our cash flows from operations in includes a million payment to johnson johnson related to certain patent disputes  discussed in note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
as of december   we had total debt of billion  cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of billion 
on february   we made a billion litigation related payment to johnson johnson  using million of cash on hand  and million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and will pay an additional million on or before january  during  we issued billion of senior notes and prepaid all billion remaining under our term loan 
in addition  standard poor s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook 
this rating improvement reflects the strength of our product portfolio  our commitment to debt reduction  our improving financial fundamentals  and the progress we are making in driving profitable sales growth 
we expect to refinance the majority of our debt maturities and revolving credit facility by mid healthcare reform and current economic climate political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments and managed care arrangements  are continuing in many countries where we do business  including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective treatments 
although we believe our less invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes  value and cost efficiency  the resources necessary to demonstrate comparative effectiveness may be significant 
in addition  uncertainty remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the us healthcare system  including the potential innovation tax on medical device companies 
additionally  our results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions 
our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products  particularly capital equipment  or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions and the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices  our net sales and profit margins  procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors 
restructuring initiatives we are a diversified worldwide medical device leader and hold number one or two positions in the majority of the markets in which we compete 
over the past thirty years  we have generated impressive revenue growth driven by product innovation  strategic acquisitions and robust investments in research and development 
we generate strong cash flow  which has enabled us to reduce our debt obligations and further invest in our growth 
on an on going basis  we monitor the dynamics of the economy  the healthcare industry  and the markets in which we compete  and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency  and better alignment of expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality  research and development projects  capital and our people that are essential to our long term success 
as a result of these assessments  we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives to focus our business  diversify and reprioritize our product 
table of contents portfolio and redirect research and development and other spending toward higher payoff products in order to enhance our growth potential 
these initiatives are described below 
restructuring plan on february   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the restructuring plan designed to strengthen and position us for long term success 
key activities under the plan include the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses  as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions  the centralization of our research and development organization  the re alignment of our international structure  and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio  in order to drive innovation  accelerate profitable growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value 
activities under the restructuring plan will be initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of we expect the execution of the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately  to  positions worldwide by the end of refer to results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for information on our restructuring related activities and estimated costs 
plant network optimization in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program is a complement to our restructuring plan  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of refer to results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for information on our restructuring related activities and estimated costs 
restructuring plan in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan the restructuring plan  these initiatives were designed to enhance short and long term shareholder value  including the restructuring of several of our businesses and product franchises  the sale of non strategic businesses and investments  and significant expense and head count reductions 
our goal was  and continues to be  to better align expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality  research and development  capital improvements and our people that are essential to our long term success 
these initiatives have helped to provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities  which we believe will strengthen boston scientific for the future and position us for increased  sustainable and profitable sales growth 
the execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately million exiting  and resulted in the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
we initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of and substantially completed the major activities under the plan as of december  refer to results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for information on our restructuring related activities and estimated costs 
divestitures during  we determined that our auditory  vascular surgery  cardiac surgery  venous access and fluid management businesses  as well as our trivascular endovascular aortic repair evar program were no longer strategic to our on going operations 
we completed the sale of these businesses in the first 
table of contents quarter of  receiving pre tax proceeds of approximately billion  and eliminated  positions in connection with these divestitures 
refer to results of operations for more information 
during  we announced our intent to monetize those investments in our portfolio determined to be non strategic 
during  we entered transactions to sell the majority of our investments in  and notes receivable from  certain publicly traded and privately held entities  and received pre tax proceeds for investments sold of million 
during  we completed the sale of our non strategic investments  and received additional proceeds of million 
in connection with our restructuring plan and strategy to reduce risk  increase operational leverage and accelerate profitable growth  we may explore opportunities to divest one or more select businesses 
business and market overview cardiac rhythm management we estimate that the worldwide crm market  including electrophysiology  approximated billion in  as compared to billion in during the third quarter of  results were published in the new england journal of medicine from the boston scientific sponsored madit crt clinical trial  which provide evidence that boston scientific s crt d therapy significantly reduces the relative risk of all cause mortality or first heart failure intervention when compared to traditional icd therapy 
these results demonstrated that early intervention with boston scientific s crt d therapy in certain patients can slow the progression of heart failure 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we announced eight year follow up data from our madit ii clinical study  which demonstrated that the life saving benefits of icd therapy improved over time 
we have completed a pre market approval filing with the us food and drug administration fda for an expanded crt d indication  and believe that we can reasonably expect fda approval by mid we believe an expanded indication would create an opportunity to strengthen the crm market and further enhance our position within that market 
our crm group net sales represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in and our worldwide crm group net sales increased million  or five percent  in  as compared to the following are the components of our worldwide crm group net sales year ended year ended december  december  in millions us international total us international total icd systems pacemaker systems crm products electrophysiology total crm group our us crm group net sales increased million  or seven percent  in  as compared to our us net sales benefited from the continued success of our next generation cognis crt d and teligen icd systems  and our altrua family of pacemaker systems  as well as marginal growth in the size of the us crm market 
in  we will continue to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next generation line of defibrillators in the us by the end of the year  which includes new features designed to improve functionality  diagnostic capability and ease of use  and anticipate launching our next generation ingenio pacemaker system in the us in the first quarter of our international crm group net sales increased million  or one percent  in  as compared to excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed a negative million to 
table of contents crm group net sales as compared to the prior year  international sales of our icd systems including crt d systems grew million  or six percent  driven by the continued adoption of our cognis crt d and teligen icd systems 
further  our international pacemaker system net sales increased million  or seven percent  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  in  as compared to  driven primarily by growing adoption of our altrua family of pacemakers 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched our cognis crt d  teligen icd and altrua pacemaker systems in japan 
we are targeting the completion of our international launch of these systems in early in addition  in july  we received ce mark approval for our latitude patient management system and have begun a phased launch in certain european countries 
the latitude technology  which enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes  is a key component of many of our implantable device systems 
we also plan to launch our next generation ingenio pacemaker system in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in the first quarter of  and in japan in the fourth quarter of  and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide crm market 
net sales from our crm group represent a significant source of our overall net sales 
therefore  increases or decreases in our crm group net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
recent disciplinary actions we have taken against certain of our us crm sales personnel could result in lost us crm net sales in the short term 
we believe that with sustained targeted investments we can continue to grow our worldwide crm business 
however  the following variables may impact the size of the crm market and or our share of that market future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors  the impact of market and economic conditions on average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed  our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology worldwide  and to effectively compete with new products available in the market  the ability of crm manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community  the referring physician community and prospective patients in crm technologies the successful conclusion and variations in outcomes of on going and future clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use and timely receipt of regulatory approvals to expand indications for use  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  our ability to retain key members of our sales team and other key personnel  particularly following disciplinary actions taken during the year  and new competitive launches 
coronary stents net sales of our coronary stent systems represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in and we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated billion in and the size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of 
table of contents percutaneous coronary intervention pci procedures performed  as well as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted  the number of devices used per procedure  average selling prices  and the drug eluting stent penetration rate historically  uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug eluting stent systems  as well as the perceived risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stent systems  contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size 
however  data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug eluting stent systems positively affected trends in the growth of the drug eluting stent market throughout and  as referring cardiologists regained and maintain confidence in this technology 
we are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy with our taxus paclitaxel eluting stent system and our everolimus product franchise  consisting of the promus stent system  currently supplied to us by abbott laboratories  and our next generation internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent system  the promus element stent system  which we launched in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in the fourth quarter of we expect to launch our promus element stent system in the us and japan in mid our product pipeline also includes the next generation taxus element stent system  which we expect to launch in emea and certain inter continental countries during the second quarter of  in the us in mid and japan in late or early recently published data from a single center  non double blinded  underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors are inconsistent with the overall body of evidence supporting our taxus paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system 
however  perceptions of these data have negatively affected  and may continue to have a negative impact on  physician and patient confidence in our technology and net sales of our taxus stent systems 
the following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales year ended year ended december  december  in millions us international total us international total taxus promus drug eluting bare metal our us net sales of drug eluting stent systems increased million  or nine percent  in  as compared to the prior year 
despite an increase in competition following two new market entrants during  we maintained our leadership position during with an estimated percent share of the us drug eluting stent market  exiting the year with an estimated percent share during the fourth quarter of we believe we have maintained our position in this market due to the success of our two drug platform strategy 
the strength of our taxus libert stent system and the promus stent system  as well as our taxus express atom stent system  launched in the us during the fourth quarter of  have combined to enable us to sustain our leadership in the us drug eluting stent market 
in the second quarter of  we received fda approval for the taxus libert atom stent system and  in july  we received approval for the taxus libert long stent system  further adding to our industry leadership for the widest range of coronary stent sizes 
in addition  increasing penetration rates have had a positive effect on the size of the us drug eluting stent market and our net sales 
average drug eluting stent penetration rates in the us were percent during  exiting at percent for the fourth quarter of  as compared to percent for  with an exit rate of percent 
penetration rates in the us consistently increased throughout and have remained steady throughout  a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures 
late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot  or thrombus  within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent 

table of contents indicating a recovery and stabilization of the us drug eluting stent market 
partially offsetting the impact of increased penetration rates on the size of the market were reductions in average selling prices in  as compared to  as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
we estimate that the average selling price of our drug eluting stent systems in the us decreased approximately eight percent in  as compared to the prior year 
our international drug eluting stent system net sales decreased million  or less than one percent  in as compared to  but were negatively impacted by million  as compared to the same period in the prior year  as a result of foreign currency exchange rates 
within our international business  net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in japan increased million  or percent  in  as compared to the prior year  driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in that region  as well as the february launch of our second generation taxus libert stent system 
we estimate that our share of the drug eluting stent market in japan was percent in  exiting at percent  as compared to a average market share of percent 
previously  our taxus drug eluting stent system was one of only two drug eluting stent products on the market in japan 
in may  however  an additional competitor entered this market  which negatively impacted our share throughout the second half of the year 
in the first quarter of  we received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw for the promus stent  and subsequently launched this product in japan 
our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our emea region decreased million  or eleven percent  and net sales of these systems in our inter continental region decreased million  or three percent  both due primarily to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and reductions in our average selling prices 
in november  we announced receipt of ce mark approval to market our next generation internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent system  the promus element stent system  and simultaneously launched this stent system in our emea region and certain inter continental countries 
our promus element stent system incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy offering greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys  and provides enhanced visibility and reduced recoil 
the innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution 
this latest product offering demonstrates our commitment to drug eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation 
our product pipeline also includes the next generation taxus element stent system  which we expect to launch in emea and certain inter continental countries during the first half of  in the us in mid and japan in late or early we market the promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  a private labeled xience v stent system supplied to us by abbott laboratories 
as of the closing of abbott s acquisition of guidant corporation s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  we obtained a perpetual license to the intellectual property used in guidant s drug eluting stent system program purchased by abbott 
we believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position  with an estimated percent market share exiting however  under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott  including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved fda pre market approval  is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
specifically  the promus stent system has operating profit margins that approximate half of our taxus stent system operating profit margin 
therefore  if sales of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott increase in relation to our total drug eluting stent system sales  our profit margins will decrease 
refer to our gross profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins 
we expect that our promus element tm stent system  launched in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in november  will have gross profit margins more comparable to our taxus stent system and will positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions 
however  this positive impact on our 
table of contents gross profit margin will be offset by the impact of recent approval and launch of the promus stent system  supplied to us by abbott  in japan 
further  the price we pay for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from abbott is determined by contracts with abbott and is based  in part  on previously fixed estimates of abbott s manufacturing costs for everolimus eluting stent systems and third party reports of our average selling price of these stent systems 
amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on abbott s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott 
our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process 
we are currently reliant on abbott for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems in the us and japan 
our supply agreement with abbott for everolimus eluting stent systems in these regions extends through the end of the second quarter of at present  we believe that our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from abbott and our current launch plans for our next generation internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent system is sufficient to meet customer demand 
however  any production or capacity issues that affect abbott s manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting  ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner  therefore  our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott may not align with customer demand  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured next generation everolimus eluting stent system  our promus element stent system  in the us and japan in mid historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties  or the market s perception of these clinical data  may adversely impact our position in  and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
we believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons  including our two drug eluting stent platform strategy  including specialty stent sizes  the broad and consistent long term results of our taxus clinical trials  and the favorable results of the xience v promus stent system clinical trials to date  the performance benefits of our current and future technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products  including our promus element and taxus element stent systems  our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force  and the strength of our clinical  selling  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
however  a decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include 
table of contents our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology features  including the promus element and taxus element stent systems  the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems available in the market  the outcomes of on going and future clinical results involving our products  including those sponsored by our competitors  or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  the outcome of intellectual property litigation  changes in fda clinical trial data and post market surveillance requirements  as well as international regulatory requirements  and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance  and physician and patient confidence in our current and next generation technology  including drug eluting stent technology  and changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates  the overall number of pci procedures performed and average number of stents used per procedure 
during  we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters  including multiple matters with johnson johnson  all outstanding litigation between us and medtronic  inc with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases  and all outstanding litigation between us and bruce saffran  md  md however  there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market 
in particular  although our recent settlements with johnson johnson resolved litigation matters  we continue to be involved in patent litigation with johnson johnson relating to drug eluting stent delivery systems 
we have each asserted that products of the other infringe patents owned or exclusively licensed by each of us 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
see note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings 
interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems in addition to coronary stent systems  our interventional cardiology business markets balloon catheters  rotational atherectomy systems  guide wires  guide catheters  embolic protection devices  and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca procedures  as well as ultrasound imaging systems 
our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to million in  as compared to billion in  a decrease of million or five percent 
our us net sales represented million in  as compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions  and competitive product launches  as well as the impact of product recalls associated with a third party provider 
our international net sales of these products increased to million in  as compared to million in despite an overall decrease in our interventional cardiology net sales  we continue to hold a strong leadership position in the ptca balloon catheter market with more than percent share of the us market  and are planning a number of additional new product launches during  including the 
table of contents apex platinum pre dilatation balloon catheter for improved radiopacity  the nc quantum apex post dilatation balloon catheter and the kinetix family of guidewires 
peripheral interventions our peripheral interventions business product offerings include stents  balloon catheters  sheaths  wires and vena cava filters  which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease 
our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million or three percent 
foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative million to our peripheral interventions net sales  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
we believe that we are well positioned in the growing peripheral interventions market  due in part to the recent launches of our carotid wallstent monorail endoprosthesis for the treatment of patients with carotid artery disease who are at high risk for surgery  our express sd renal monorail premounted stent system for use as an adjunct therapy to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in certain lesions of the renal arteries  and our sterling monorail and over the wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we expect to receive fda approval for an iliac indication for our express ld stent system 
we believe that these product offerings will continue to provide positive momentum for our peripheral interventions business 
endoscopy our endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems 
our worldwide net sales of these products increased million  or seven percent  to billion in  as compared to million in our us net sales of these products increased million to million  as compared to the same period in the prior year  and our international net sales increased million  despite an million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates  to million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our worldwide endoscopy net sales increased eight percent in  as compared to this increase was due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise  due largely to the us launch of the wallflex biliary stent system and continued commercialization of the wallflex esophageal stent 
in addition  our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our resolution clip device  an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding  and our biliary franchise drove solid growth on the strength of our rapid exchange biliary devices 
during  we will continue the commercialization of our market leading wallflex stent line  our dreamwire high performance guidewire and dreamtome rx cannulating sphincterotome  as well as expanded sizes of our radial jaw biopsy forceps 
urology women s health our urology women s health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders 
our worldwide net sales of these products increased million  or six percent  to million in our us net sales increased million during  as compared to the prior year  to million  and our international net sales increased million  as compared to  to million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  net sales of our urology women s health products increased million  or six percent  in  as compared to  and were negatively impacted by a july recall related to catheters used in our prolieve thermodilatation system for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
this recall had a negative impact of approximately million resulting from estimated lost sales 
the product issue that resulted in this recall has been corrected  and we re launched the new catheter in november we do not expect that this recall will have a material future impact on our urology women s health net sales 
our women s health business grew approximately percent in  as compared to the prior year  on the strength of several new product launches  including our solyx single incision sling system and our uphold vaginal support system 
in 
table of contents addition  we executed two new women s health product launches during with our second generation procerva hydro thermablator hta procedure set  used in the treatment of excessive uterine bleeding  as well as our new pinnacle posterior pelvic floor repair kit 
we expect these launches to continue to drive growth in our women s health business 
neuromodulation within our neuromodulation business  we market the precision spinal cord stimulation scs system  used for the management of chronic pain 
our worldwide net sales of neuromodulation products increased to million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million or approximately percent 
our us net sales of neuromodulation products were million for  as compared to million in the prior year 
we believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as multiple independent current control  which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely 
as a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation  we are initiating a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome 
we believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care 
in addition  we anticipate the launch of two new lead products during these factors  coupled with the move of our neuromodulation business to a new state of the art facility  position us well for continued growth in this market 
neurovascular we market a broad line of products used in treating diseases of the neurovascular system and hold leading market positions in several product markets 
our worldwide net sales of neurovascular products decreased to million in  as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or three percent  resulting primarily from new competitive launches and a delay in the launch of our next generation products 
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative million to our worldwide neurovascular sales in  as compared to we plan to launch a next generation family of detachable coils  including an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times  in the us in within our product pipeline  we are also developing next generation technologies for the treatment of aneurysms  icad and acute ischemic stroke  and are involved in numerous clinical activities that are designed to expand the size of the worldwide neurovascular market 
innovation our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
we expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in  and diversify into  areas including atrial fibrillation  underserved defibrillator populations  acute ischemic stroke  coronary artery disease  peripheral vascular disease  structural heart disease  vascular closure  hypertension  women s health  endoluminal surgery  diabetes obesity  endoscopic pulmonary intervention and deep brain stimulation 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance 
a delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth 
we have historically entered strategic alliances with both publicly traded and privately held companies 
we enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
during  we monetized certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic see the restructuring initiatives section for more information 
while we 
table of contents believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth  the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute 
an inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these strategic alliances 
certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing  depending on their size and nature 
regulatory compliance in january  legacy boston scientific received a corporate warning letter from the fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
we have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the fda and have made significant progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions 
during  the fda reinspected a number of our facilities and  in october  informed us that our quality system is now in substantial compliance with its quality system regulations 
the fda has approved all of our requests for final approval of class iii product submissions previously on hold due to the corporate warning letter and is processing all requests for certificates to foreign governments cfgs 
in november of and january of  the fda reinspected two official action indicated boston scientific sites to follow up on observations from the fda inspections 
both of these fda inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter have been removed 
the corporate warning letter remains in place pending fda internal administrative procedures 
during the first quarter of  we acquired a third party sterilization facility which was subject to a warning letter from the fda 
the fda had requested documentation and explanations regarding various corrective actions related to the facility 
this information was provided to the fda and the fda has since re inspected the facility  issuing no observations  and subsequently removed all restrictions related to the warning letter 
other governmental matters certain state governments have recently enacted  and the federal government has proposed  legislation aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between industry and health care professionals hcps 
as a result  we are required by law to report many types of direct and indirect payments and other transfers of value to hcps licensed by certain states and expect that we will have to make similar reports at the federal level in the near future 
we are devoting substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure  policies  systems and processes in order to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements 
our new systems are designed to provide enhanced visibility and consistency across our businesses with respect to our interactions with health care professionals 
implementation of these policies  systems and processes  or failure to comply with these policies could have a negative impact our results of operations 
reimbursement and funding our products are purchased principally by hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs eg  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients 
third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria 
reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services 
table of contents assessed resource costs  clinical outcomes and economic value 
these reimbursement methodologies confer different  and sometimes conflicting  levels of financial risk and incentives to hcps and patients  and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements 
third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
accordingly  the outcome of these reimbursement decisions could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the current economic climate may impose further pressure on funds available for reimbursement of healthcare and on reimbursement levels 
manufacturing and raw materials we design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world 
many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources 
certain items are custom made to meet our specifications 
we believe that in most cases  redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time 
we also have an on going program to identify single source components and to develop alternative back up supplies 
however  in certain cases  we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific components  materials or products  largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers 
a reduction or interruption in supply  an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required  or a significant increase in the price of raw materials  components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition  particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drug eluting stent systems 
in addition  our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and third party vendors to perform this service 
to the extent our sterilizers are unable to process our products  whether due to raw material  capacity  regulatory or other constraints  we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner  which could have an adverse impact on our operations 
international markets our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
international markets  including japan  are affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  are under way in many countries in which we do business 
implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as japan  europe and other international markets may limit the price of  or the level at which reimbursement is provided for  our products and may influence a physician s selection of products used to treat patients 
we expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets 
in addition  most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices  and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions 
further  some emerging markets rely on the fda s cfgs in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements 
although the corporate warning letter has not been formally resolved  the fda has approved all currently eligible requests for cfgs 
however  any limits on our 
table of contents ability to market our full line of existing products and to launch new products within these jurisdictions could have an adverse impact on our business 
results of operations net sales we manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis  and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level 
to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange  we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to us dollars using current period currency exchange rates 
the regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in note p segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report

during the first quarter of  we reorganized our international structure to provide more direct sales focus in the marketplace 
accordingly  we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our business 
as of december   we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions the united states  emea  consisting of europe  the middle east and africa  japan  and inter continental  consisting of asia pacific and the americas

the shift in sales away from taxus stent systems was due primarily to increased sales of the promus stent system in the us  following its july approval and launch 
sales of the promus stent system represented approximately percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales in  percent in  and two percent in under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit margin of a promus stent system  supplied to us by abbott  is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
our gross profit margin for  as compared to the prior year  was also positively impacted by percentage points attributable to the settlement of foreign currency hedge contracts on intercompany and third party transactions 
the settlement of these contracts had a negative impact on our gross profit margin of percentage points in  as compared to in addition  our gross profit margins decreased by percentage points in  as compared to  due to increases in period expenses associated with inventory charges 
inventory and manufacturing equipment obsolescence charges in were relatively flat to  and included approximately million of inventory write downs and manufacturing equipment obsolescence write offs within our crm division  related primarily to the resolution of a product advisory that resulted in the transition to a new version of our cognis crt d and teligen icd system product offerings

restructuring in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan the restructuring plan  which resulted in the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
we are providing affected employees with severance packages  outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support 
the plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value 
key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses  corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources  strengthen competitive positions  and create a more simplified and efficient business model  the elimination  suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects  and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities 
we initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of the transfer of production lines contemplated under the restructuring plan will continue throughout  all other major activities under the plan were completed as of december  we expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre tax expenses of approximately million to million 
we have recorded related costs of million since the inception of the plan  and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations

as a result of the execution of our restructuring plan and our divestiture related initiatives  we reduced research and development and sg a expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately million exiting in addition  we expect annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million to million as a result of our transfers of production lines 
due to the longer term nature of these initiatives  we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until we have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases  primarily in customer facing positions  to drive future sales growth 
in addition  in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program is a complement to our restructuring plan  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of we estimate that the program will result in annual reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million to million in these savings are in addition to the estimated million to million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs in from activities under our restructuring plan

further  on february   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the restructuring plan designed to strengthen and position us for long term success 
we estimate that the execution of this plan will result in reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately million to million  once completed in we will reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business 
key activities under the plan include the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses  as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions  the centralization of our r d organization  the re alignment of our international structure  and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio  in order to drive innovation  accelerate profitable growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value

table of contents certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration 
see note d acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  performance milestones will be reached  or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
additionally  we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash  including cash obtained through the sale of our stock 
certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
during the first quarter of  we reached an agreement to settle three patent disputes with johnson johnson for billion  plus interest 
we paid billion  consisting of million of cash on hand and million borrowed from our revolving credit facility  during the first quarter of and will satisfy the remaining obligation on or before january  in addition  during the first half of  billion of our outstanding debt obligations  as well as our revolving credit facility  will mature 
we expect to refinance the majority of our debt maturities and revolving credit facility by mid as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  as compared to million as of december   which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers compensation programs 
the decrease is due primarily to the payment of million to johnson johnson during and the termination of an associated letter of credit 
in february  we posted a million letter of credit under our billion revolving credit facility as collateral for the future johnson and johnson obligation discussed above  which reduces availability under the facility by the same amount 
see note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings 
as of december   none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees  and  as of december  and  we had accrued the johnson johnson obligations in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  or we believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit 
we also maintain a million credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
there were no other amounts borrowed under these facilities as of december  or december  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of single use medical devices  and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment  unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  or implant  which indicates that the sale is complete 
for our other transactions  we recognize revenue when our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer  provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance  and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns 
for multiple element arrangements where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations  as with our latitude patient management system  we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value and using the residual method of allocation  and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period 
we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings  for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices 
we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 
warranty obligations we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on historical experience 
we record a liability equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust the amounts as necessary 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product 
table of contents launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
valuation of business combinations we record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition  including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill 
we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations  amounts for purchased research and development  and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
r  business combinations codified within asc topic  business combinations 
pursuant to the guidance in statement no 
r topic  in those circumstances where an acquisition involves contingent consideration  we would recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payment at the acquisition date 
for acquisitions consummated prior to january   we will continue to record contingent consideration as an additional element of cost of the acquired entity when the contingency is resolved and consideration is issued or becomes issuable 
purchased research and development our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
through december  we expensed the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date 
as discussed above  as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
r  business combinations codified within asc topic  business combinations  a replacement for statement no 
statement no 
r also superseded fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date 
statement no 
r topic requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts 
during  we did not consummate any material business combinations 
for any future business combinations that we enter  we will recognize purchased research and development as an intangible asset 
in addition  we record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and development 
our adoption of statement no 
r topic did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  
table of contents expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used risk adjusted discount rates of percent in and percent in to discount our projected cash flows 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
however  if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a whole 
impairment of intangible assets we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
in addition  we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  a product recall  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
for purposes of the recoverability test  we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
to test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  we write the carrying value down to the fair value 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
see note e goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairment of intangible assets during  and for patents developed internally  we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents  including attorney fees  registration fees  consulting fees  and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent 
legal costs incurred in connection with the successful defense of both internally developed patents and those obtained through our acquisitions are capitalized and amortized over the remaining amortizable life of the related patent 
goodwill impairment we test our april goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the assessment  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of 
table of contents these units 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments  and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics 
for our april  annual impairment assessment  we identified our reporting units to be our six us operating segments  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment  and our four international operating segments 
when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition 
in addition  for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining its fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
during  and  we used only the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach 
therefore  we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill  we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use estimates of market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
during the fourth quarter of  the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation 
as a result of economic conditions and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets  which became more pronounced starting in the fourth quarter of  our estimated risk adjusted wacc increased basis points from percent during our 
table of contents second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to percent during our fourth quarter interim impairment assessment 
this change  along with reductions in market demand for products in our us crm reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of the guidant acquisition  were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge 
our estimated market participant wacc decreased basis points from percent during our fourth quarter interim impairment assessment to percent during our second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment  and our other significant assumptions remained largely consistent 
our goodwill impairment test did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded implied fair values 
the majority of our reporting units do not have a material amount of goodwill that is at risk of failing a future impairment test 
while we do not believe there are indicators of impairment as of december  to necessitate the performance of an interim impairment test  we have considered current and future expected economic conditions as of year end and  as a result  we have identified two reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm group and emea region  each to which we have allocated a significant portion of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation 
the aggregate amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units was approximately billion as of december  for each of these reporting units  the level of excess fair value over carrying value exceeded percent as of our second quarter impairment assessment 
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests  these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
the key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates and discount rate assumptions 
future events that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the reporting units include  but are not limited to decreases in estimated market sizes due to pricing pressures and the underlying health of local economies  declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition  an inability to launch new products  and market and or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls  negative developments in current and future intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products  increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products  and the level of success of future research and development efforts  legislative and administrative reforms  which may impact the healthcare industry  and could negatively impact our future selling prices  operating costs and taxes we may be obligated to pay  and increases in our risk adjusted wacc due to further instability or deterioration of the equity and credit markets 
changes in one or more of the factors outlined above could present a situation whereby it may be reasonably likely that an impairment may occur over the next twelve months in our us crm and emea reporting units 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we had net deferred tax liabilities of billion as of december  and billion as of december  gross deferred tax liabilities of billion as of december  and 
table of contents billion as of december  relate primarily to intangible assets acquired in connection with our prior acquisitions 
gross deferred tax assets of billion as of december  and billion as of december  relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  litigation and product liability reserves  purchased research and development  investment write downs  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance and the extent of our deferred tax liabilities  we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets 
as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
r  business combinations  codified within asc topic which requires that we recognize changes in acquired income tax uncertainties applied to acquisitions before and after the adoption date as income tax expense or benefit 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are billion as of december  and billion as of december  we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination 
legal  product liability costs and securities claims we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract  securities litigation and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products 
we are also the subject of certain governmental investigations  which could result in substantial fines  penalties  and administrative remedies 
we are substantially self insured with respect to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims 
we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims 
we generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
in accordance with asc topic  contingencies formerly fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue anticipated costs of settlement  damages losses for general product liability claims and  under certain conditions  costs of defense  based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
we analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement 
we allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value  and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an on going future benefit

boston scientific corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states

our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

our interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments 
we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates

we recognized million of interest expense related to early termination of these interest rate contracts during we recorded million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments as of december  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments fair value by million as of december  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments fair value by million as of december  as of december   billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates  representing nearly percent of our total debt
