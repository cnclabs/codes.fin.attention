overview and outlook we benefit from a diversified and balanced business  serving both commercial and government markets 
this diversification and balance was an important attribute that helped support the performance of our company during our government systems business realized revenue growth from acquisitions and from higher organic sales to customers who remain focused on increasing the effectiveness of the war fighter 
our commercial systems business continued to experience lingering effects from uncertainty in the global economic recovery and the adverse impact on our commercial aerospace customers 
we took aggressive actions to manage the cost structure of our business and position our portfolios appropriately for these market conditions 
we adjusted our operations to increase efficiency and balance capacity as we completed the closure of our facility in san jose  california and relocated work previously done there to other locations 
we focused on containing costs and accelerating the margin accretion of our datapath  inc datapath acquisition 
as a result of these efforts  we generated the following results for we achieved sales of billion we delivered earnings per share of we generated operating cash flow of million we continued to invest in research and development r d at percent of sales we believe our company has proven its ability to both react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans 
our fundamental strategies continue to serve us well the balance between our commercial and government businesses  the diversification of our customer base and product offerings  the integration of our business through our shared service operating model and our focus on innovation through r d 
balance we feel our business is characterized by its balance  in terms of market segment  geographic regions and product and customer sales mix 
we strive to maintain a balance between our government and commercial systems businesses  believing that the segments are complementary to one another 
in  we expect the strength of our commercial systems business to drive our growth with a modest increase in our government systems business 
we believe our balanced business portfolio is a fundamental strength of our company 

table of contents diversification our business derives its revenue streams from a large number of diverse customers  products  solutions  geographic regions and markets 
our government systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers  including the us department of defense  state and local governments  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
our commercial systems business serves customers ranging from the world s largest aircraft manufacturers to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace 
this diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios 
integration we have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared services operating platform 
the integrated nature of our business allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry 
this integration is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays  communication  navigation and surveillance  through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both government and commercial systems 
innovation a well funded and comprehensive r d program is a foundational aspect of our company 
our focus on developing unique solutions to our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards r d programs 
it is this spending profile that has allowed us to successfully pursue and capture customer programs and that will continue to be the growth engine for our company 
looking forward to  we believe we are positioned to realize a return to growth in our commercial systems business and continued increases  although at more modest levels than in recent years  in our government systems business 
highlights of our earnings guidance are as follows total sales in the range of billion to billion  or about a percent to percent increase over diluted earnings per share in the range of to cash provided by operating activities in the range of million to million capital expenditures of approximately million total company and customer funded r d expenditures in the range of million to million  or about percent of total sales see the following sections for further discussion of and anticipated results of operations

table of contents results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of results of operations is based on reported financial results for through and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item below 
consolidated financial results sales dollars in millions us non us total percent increase decrease sales are attributed to geographic region based on country of destination 
sales for compared to total sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in government systems sales partially offset by an million reduction in commercial systems sales 
incremental sales from the may acquisition of datapath  the december acquisition of ar group  inc air routing and the november acquisition of seos group limited seos  contributed a total of million in revenue or percentage points of revenue growth 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment in and is found in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily attributable to sales growth in our government systems segment driven by higher product and service sales from the datapath acquisition and increased sales to the us government 
in addition  higher commercial systems sales to boeing and incremental service sales from the air routing acquisition were partially offset by decreased sales to domestic business jet original equipment manufacturers oems 
non us sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to lower commercial systems sales impacted by reduced production rates at non us business and regional jet oems  partially offset by incremental sales to regions outside of the us from the datapath and seos acquisitions 
sales for compared to total sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to a million reduction in commercial systems sales  partially offset by a million increase in government systems sales 
incremental sales from the april acquisition of athena technologies  inc athena  the november acquisition of seos and the may acquisition of datapath  contributed a total of million in revenue  or percentage points of revenue growth 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment in and is found in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume of commercial systems products and systems to oems and reduced commercial avionics aftermarket hardware and service and support revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by incremental revenue from the datapath and athena acquisitions and higher sales to the us government 

table of contents non us sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the decline in commercial systems sales resulting from lower production rates at oems and a reduction in commercial avionics aftermarket hardware and service and support revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by incremental sales from the seos and datapath acquisitions 
cost of sales total cost of sales is summarized as follows dollars in millions total cost of sales percent of total sales cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes r d  raw material  labor  facility  product warranty and other related expenses 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following incremental product and service cost of sales from the datapath  air routing and seos acquisitions totaling million a million increase attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses 
for  million of employee compensation expense was included in cost of sales 
for  no employee incentive compensation was awarded 
in addition  a favorable adjustment to reduce cost of sales by million occurred during resulting from lower than expected compensation payments made to employees in for incentive awards earned in a million increase attributable to higher defined benefit pension expense 
as discussed in the retirement plans section below  the increase in pension expense was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension expense from percent in to percent in for  million of pension expense was included within cost of sales  compared to million of pension income during a million benefit due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges that were incurred in and primarily related to the closure of our facility in san jose  california a million decrease from lower company funded r d costs as explained in detail below the remaining variance primarily related to a million increase in cost of sales associated with the organic sales growth in government systems  partially offset by a million reduction in cost of sales from lower organic commercial systems sales volume 
see the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below for further discussion cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales decreased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following a million decrease from lower organic commercial systems sales volume  partially offset by a million increase associated with the organic sales growth in government

for  million of employee incentive compensation expense was included within cost of sales a million decrease from lower company funded r d costs as explained in detail below a million decrease attributable to higher defined benefit pension income 
as discussed in the retirement plans section below  the higher pension income was primarily due to the favorable impact of an increase in the discount rate used to measure our us pension expense from percent in to percent in pension income included within cost of sales was million for and million for the above items were partially offset by incremental cost of sales from the datapath  seos and athena acquisitions totaling million as well as million of costs associated with the restructuring and asset impairment charges r d expense included in cost of sales for  and r d expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows dollars in millions customer funded government systems commercial systems total customer funded company funded government systems commercial systems total company funded total research and development percent of total sales company funded r d expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in r d activities  engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs 
customer funded r d expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale when earned 
total r d expense increased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased million from to  primarily due to a million increase within government systems from customer funded development efforts on a european fixed wing aircraft program and a vehicle electronics integration program 
the increase in customer funded r d was partially offset by a million decrease in company funded r d 
commercial systems company funded r d decreased million  primarily from lower spending as certain projects neared completion and the timing of other efforts were delayed as we continued to manage our cost structure and adjust to market demands 
this decrease was partially offset by an million increase in company funded r d expense within government systems  primarily related to the datapath acquisition and increased spending on other programs 

table of contents total r d expense decreased million from to this decrease was primarily related to a million reduction in commercial systems company funded r d expense driven by lower development costs on the boeing program and reduced spending on certain other initiatives as global macro economic factors adversely impacted our commercial markets  partially offset by increased spending on the airbus a program 
the customer funded portion of r d expense decreased slightly from to as lower customer funded development on certain commercial air transport platforms with boeing were partially offset by higher customer funded development within government systems on programs such as common range integrated instrumentation system criis and joint precision approach and landing system jpals 
looking forward to  total r d expense is expected to increase by approximately to percent over and be in the range of million to million  or about percent of total company sales 
the increase is primarily due to expected growth in customer funded r d principally related to recent awards and anticipated government systems development programs and other customer funded development programs within commercial systems related to certain asian regional jet programs 
increases are also expected in company funded r d as government systems continues to apply our commercial flight deck architecture into military and civil applications and commercial systems applies our fusion product to certain next generation flight decks for business aircraft 
selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a percent of total sales sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or r d activities 
these activities include marketing and business development  finance  legal  information technology and other administrative and management functions 
total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following a million increase due to the combined impact of incremental sg a expense from the datapath  air routing and seos acquisitions  higher employee incentive compensation costs and an increase in defined benefit pension expense a million decrease in sg a expense primarily comprised of reductions in employee headcount and other cost savings sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following a million decrease from the combined impact of lower employee incentive compensation costs and reduced defined benefit pension expense the remaining variance resulted from a million net increase attributable primarily to incremental sg a expense from the datapath  seos and athena acquisitions  which were mostly offset by reductions in employee headcount and other cost savings interest expense in millions interest expense 
table of contents interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to a full year of interest expense associated with the million of long term debt issued may  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below for more detail regarding outstanding debt 
interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to a more favorable interest rate environment on our variable rate short term debt outstanding during other income  net in millions other income  net for information regarding the fluctuations in other income  net  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
income tax expense dollars in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate as detailed below statutory tax rate state and local income taxes research and development credit domestic manufacturing deduction tax settlements other effective income tax rate the difference between our effective income tax rate in and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the benefit from the settlement of certain tax matters  the tax benefits derived from the federal research and development tax credit federal r d tax credit  which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental r d expenditures  and the domestic manufacturing deduction under section dmd  which provides a tax benefit on us based manufacturing 
the effective income tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the favorable impact of the internal revenue service irs completing its examination of the taxable years ended september  and  partially offset by differences in the availability of the federal r d tax credit which expired december  the effective income tax rate in increased from primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax settlements that benefited our effective income tax rate in the effective income tax rates for  and include a tax benefit related to the dmd 
the dmd tax benefit available in  and was being phased in by statute and was therefore lower than the full dmd tax benefit which will be effective beginning in fiscal year for  our effective income tax rate is projected to be in the range of percent to percent in comparison to our effective income tax rate of percent 
the projected effective income tax rate assumes the federal r d tax credit is available for the entire fiscal year  although legislation authorizing federal r d tax credit beyond december  has yet to be enacted 

table of contents management believes a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is not considered necessary because it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be fully realized  except for million of deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved related to foreign net operating losses in sweden and the united kingdom which are not subject to expirations  a domestic capital loss carryforward which expires in  and state r d credit carryovers with varying expiration dates 
net income and diluted earnings per share dollars and shares in millions  except per share amounts net income net income as a percent of sales diluted earnings per share weighted average diluted common shares net income for decreased percent to million  or percent of sales  from net income of million  or percent of sales  for diluted earnings per share decreased percent to for compared to for the decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher expense from increased pension and employee incentive compensation costs and lower earnings from reduced commercial systems sales volume as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section 
these items were partially offset by higher earnings from increased government systems sales volume as discussed in the government systems financial results section  a reduction to the effective income tax rate as discussed in the income taxes section and lower restructuring and asset impairment charges which occurred in and primarily related to the closure of our facility in san jose  california 
the restructuring and asset impairment charge was million after taxes  or million before income taxes 
net income in decreased percent to million  or percent of sales  from net income in of million  or percent of sales 
diluted earnings per share decreased percent in to  compared to in the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower earnings from reduced commercial systems sales volume as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section  an increase to the effective income tax rate as discussed in the income taxes section and the million after tax restructuring and asset impairment charge million before income taxes that was primarily related to the decision to close our san jose  california facility 
these items were partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation costs  higher earnings from increased government systems sales volume as discussed in the government systems financial results section and lower company funded r d costs 
the decrease in earnings per share was lower than the decrease in net income due to the positive impact of our share repurchase program 
segment financial results government systems overview and outlook our government systems business provides communication and electronic systems  products and services for airborne and surface applications to the us department of defense  state and local governments  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
these systems  products and services support airborne fixed and rotary wing  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and us governments  which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits in the us and abroad 

table of contents we expect global baseline defense budgets to be constrained as we move into and the available funding for our r d and procurement budgets to be relatively flat due to a combination of factors 
these factors include a reduction in supplemental appropriations that could put further pressure on procurement budgets  the impact of announced program cuts such as completion of the f program and restructuring of future combat systems  and the potential for eurofighter program delays and other program delays similar to those realized in in spite of the market environment  we believe high priority military transformation initiatives and customer demand for cost effective solutions to modernize and extend the life of current systems or to replace systems returning from deployment will lead to funding support for our military communications and electronics equipment 
we expect that these customer priorities  combined with our strengthening positions in certain faster growing areas of our served defense electronics and communications markets  should enable us to deliver modest revenue growth in we continue to expand our involvement in certain segments of the defense electronics market and expect to see future growth from sales of our products and services for unmanned air vehicles  ground vehicles and soldier systems 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include  but are not limited to potential impact of geopolitical and economic events overall funding and prioritization of the us and us defense budgets delayed or reduced funding for programs we have won our ability to win new business  successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements we expect government systems sales to increase by approximately percent in compared to growth areas are expected to be as follows rotary wing platform avionics electronic systems integration simulation and training systems micro defense advanced gps receiver dagr products surface communication equipment programs growth in the above areas is likely to be partially offset by expected declines in the following kc global air traffic management gatm program reduced shipments of display and communications equipment for fighter jet platforms joint tactical radio system jtrs programs as it transitions from development to low rate initial production lower volume following initial deliveries on an electronic system integration program for the california highway patrol reduced production rates for legacy global positioning system gps products we project government systems segment operating margins will be comparable to the percent segment operating margin reported in as expected increases in employee incentive compensation expenses are expected to be offset by a decrease in defined benefit pension plan expenses as discussed in the retirement plans section below

commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and fractional and other business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  the financial condition of airlines worldwide as well as corporate profits 
we are experiencing diverging trends in the commercial markets that we serve 
the strength of backlog and projected recovery of aircraft orders has prompted an increase in production rates by our air transport oem customers 
these increased rates are a positive sign that airlines expect to see continued favorable traffic trends as we move into conversely  the market for new business and regional jets has remained stressed on weak orders and uncertainty relative to macroeconomic indicators 
thus we expect deliveries of business and regional jets in to be relatively flat as compared to we expect a favorable commercial aftermarket environment due to continued increases in passenger traffic and airline capacity 
additionally  stronger airline profitability is expected to drive significant increases in demand for our retrofit and spare products 
risks to the commercial systems market include  among other things turbulence in global economic and financial markets could continue to have a significant impact on demand for air travel  airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical or health pandemic event that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers 
table of contents our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market acceptance of our products and systems continued pressure on corporate profits we expect commercial systems sales to increase by percent in compared to primarily due to the following sales to air transport aircraft oems are expected to increase approximately percent as a result of the entry into service and ramp up in production of boeing s and planned production rate increases of airbus a sales to business and regional jet aircraft oems are projected to increase in the low teens due to the introduction of our avionics on bombardier global aircraft and a full year of production of the cessna cj excluding wide body ife service and support activities  air transport aftermarket are expected to experience approximately percent revenue growth due to continued increases in passenger traffic  airlines bringing in additional capacity and stronger airline profitability business and regional jet aftermarket revenues are expected to increase in the mid teens as a result of continued improvement in aircraft utilization and demand for retrofit products the above items are expected to be partially offset by an estimated reduction of million in sales of wide body ife products and systems due to our decision in to cease investing in this product area 
sales related to wide body ife services are expected to decline an additional million as customers continue to retire older aircraft or replace their ife systems we project commercial systems operating margins will be higher than the percent segment operating margins reported in  due primarily to the forecasted increase in sales volumes 
anticipated increases in employee incentive compensation expense are expected to be largely offset by a decrease in defined benefit pension plan expenses as discussed in the retirement plans section below

our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
we plan to contribute million to our us qualified pension plan in  which we anticipate will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns  interest rates and any changes to us pension funding legislation 
we may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during to further improve the funded status of this plan 
contributions to our non us plans and our us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits we have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees 
we have undertaken two major actions over the past number of years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits in july of  the pre and post retiree medical plans were amended to establish a fixed company contribution 
additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount 
this amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we amended our retiree medical plans on june  to discontinue post prescription drug coverage effective january  post retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through medicare 
we believe the medicare prescription drug benefit is generally better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post drug plan other retirement benefits expense income for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
other retirement benefits expense was relatively flat in compared to the increase in other retirement benefits expense in 
table of contents compared to was primarily due to the completion of favorable amortization for a plan amendment 
we expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately million in financial condition and liquidity cash flow summary our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners

table of contents share repurchase program strong cash flow from operations provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows in millions  except per share amounts amount of share repurchases number of shares repurchased weighted average price per share approximately million and million of the and share repurchases reflected in the table above are included within accounts payable at september  and and are therefore reflected as a non cash transaction in our and consolidated statement of cash flows  respectively 
dividends we declared and paid cash dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash dividends in was the result of an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share beginning with the dividend paid on june  based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
financial condition and liquidity we have historically maintained a financial structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets 
when combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations  this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners 
a comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of september  and are as follows september in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments short term debt long term debt  net net debt total equity debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization calculated as total of short term and long term debt  net total debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity calculated as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total equity we primarily fund our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities 
due to the seasonality of cash flows  we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing 
table of contents short term commercial paper 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than days from the date of issuance 
we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  and in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired  we have access to an million revolving credit facility through a network of banks that matures in  with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to billion 
these options are subject to the approval of the lenders 
our only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent  excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  based on this financial covenant was percent 
we had no borrowings at september  under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities  debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to which we can publicly offer and sell securities from time to time 
this shelf registration covers an unlimited amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or warrants that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
to date  we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates 
our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets 
if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing

our commitments under these operating leases  in the form of non cancelable future lease payments  are not reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of financial position 
purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts 
purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable 
purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 

table of contents the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made 
program investments we defer certain pre production engineering costs in inventories  net and record up front sales incentives in intangible assets collectively referred to as program investments 
these program investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to a maximum of years 
estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
this provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit 
the following provides an overview of the program investments september in millions pre production engineering costs up front sales incentives total program investments we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of an aircraft program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers 
these customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts in the event the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer 
these costs are deferred in inventories  net to the extent of the contractual guarantees 
pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for 
table of contents reimbursement are expensed as incurred 
these costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to years  as a component of cost of sales 
we also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to years 
up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales 
risks inherent in recovering the value of our program investments include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program 
in particular  the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions  which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors  the availability of specialized materials and other production risks we evaluate the carrying amount of program investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program 
no impairment charges related to program investments were recorded in  or while we believe our program investments are recoverable over time  the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to program investments 
due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry  we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly cancelling a program is remote 
we also evaluate our amortization of program investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
the impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the program investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis 
there were no significant changes in the rate of program investment amortization in  and income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual net income by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability 
table of contents to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and  to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income  except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and relate to foreign net operating losses  state r d credit carryovers and a domestic capital loss carryforward 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits  deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows 
our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete 
discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations 
our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of  and yielded no impairments 
if there were a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms 
at september   we have recorded million of warranty liabilities 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be 
table of contents required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense 
the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension expense caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows in millions change in assumption assumption basis point increase basis point decrease pension obligation discount rate pension expense decrease pension expense increase expected long term rate of return on plan assets pension expense decrease pension expense increase inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior  although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory 
life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 

table of contents excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments  we had million of gross inventory on hand at september  with million of inventory valuation reserves 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pre production engineering costs are discussed in the program investments section of our critical accounting policies above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less 
percent by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
at september   we also had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in january we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt based on six month libor plus percent by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would have decreased or increased the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt  exclusive of the effects of the interest rate swap contracts  by million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the million notional value of interest rate swap contracts was a million asset at september  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by million and million  respectively 
at september   we also had million of variable rate short term debt outstanding 
our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates related to variable rate debt 
inclusive of the effect of the interest rate swaps  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would not have a material effect on our operations or cash flows 
for more information related to outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments  see notes  and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 

table of contents foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies which subjects our cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes to foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to manage this exposure through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts foreign currency contracts 
all foreign currency contracts are executed with banks we believe to be creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
the majority of our non functional currency firm and anticipated receivables and payables are hedged using foreign currency contracts 
it is our policy not to manage exposure to net investments in non us subsidiaries or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts were million and million at september  and  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates 
principal currencies that are hedged include the european euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
the duration of foreign currency contracts is generally five years or less 
the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts was a net asset of million and a net liability of million at september  and  respectively 
a percent increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million 
for more information related to outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below
