results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal included in the million of income from continuing operations in fiscal was lifo expense of million 
included in the million of income from continuing operations in fiscal was lifo income of million 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in fiscal net income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
the acm group produces turbine engine components for small aircraft such as business and regional jets  military transport and surveillance aircraft 
turbine engine components are also produced for armored military vehicles powered by small turbine engines 
net sales comparative information for fiscal and  respectively  is as follows year ended september  increase decrease net sales airframe components for small aircraft small turbine engine components airframe components for large aircraft turbine engine components for large aircraft commercial product sales and other revenue total the decrease in net sales of airframe components for both small and large aircraft  as well as turbine engine components for large aircraft  during fiscal  compared with fiscal  is principally due to a decrease in the sales volumes of such components to customers 
such volume declines were caused by the overall weak global economic conditions that resulted in reduced build rates of commercial aircraft 
the decrease in net sales of small turbine engine components during fiscal  compared with fiscal  is primarily attributable to declines in the production and delivery of armored military vehicles that are powered by small turbine engines 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase in sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft such as military transport and surveillance aircraft 
the decline in commercial product net sales is due to volume decline caused by the overall weak global economic conditions 
the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of such components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal ongoing wartime demand  such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components  is the primary driver of net sales of the components that have military applications  as well as net sales of components that have both military and commercial applications 
the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally due to i lower variable selling expenses as a result of both lower net sales and lower sales representative commission rates as well as ii lower expenses associated with uncollectible accounts receivable in fiscal  compared with fiscal this was partially offset by higher employee incentive expense and consulting costs related to the implementation of a company wide management information system 
the acm group s operating income decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the following is a comparison of operating income on both a lifo and fifo basis year ended september  increase decrease operating income operating income lifo expense income operating income without lifo expense income operating income was negatively impacted to a modest degree by the raw material component of manufacturing costs being approximately of net sales in fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal  due primarily to product mix 
operating income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was negatively impacted by lower production levels  due to lower net sales volumes 
the lower production levels resulted in the acm group s fixed manufacturing cost structure being allocated to fewer units of production resulting in higher per unit overhead expenses 
this negative impact was partially offset by the following changes in certain other components of the acm group s manufacturing expenditures in fiscal  compared with fiscal year ended september  increase decrease manufacturing expenditures overhead utilities repairs  maintenance and supplies depreciation tooling manufacturing costs benefited in fiscal  compared with fiscal  from i a decline in the acm group s price paid for natural gas as a result of global economic conditions  ii a decline in the volume of natural gas consumed as a result of the aforementioned lower production levels  and iii a decrease in expenditures for repairs and maintenance and production supplies also due primarily to the lower production levels 
depreciation expense was higher in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due to the effect of recent capital expenditures for equipment 
turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the repair group s decrease in net sales volumes is due to i a component repair program being on hold subject to the original equipment manufacturer s oem evaluation redesign of the repair  ii the overall weak global economic conditions and iii a larger customer consolidating its sources for component repair 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the repair group s operating results were essentially breakeven in fiscal  compared with an operating income of million in fiscal a decrease in operating income principally attributable to the negative impact on margins from decreased sales volumes that occurred in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was partially offset by lower manufacturing labor and benefits costs due to a reduction in manufacturing employee wage rates and benefit levels 
applied surface concepts group asc group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  i product net sales consist of selective electrochemical metal finishing equipment and solutions and ii contract service net sales consist of customized selective electrochemical metal finishing services 
net sales comparative information for fiscal and  respectively  is as follows year ended september  increase decrease net sales product contract service other total the decrease in product net sales in fiscal is primarily due to the loss of two customers  one due to a product redesign and the other due to a change in its production methods 
partially offsetting these declines in product net sales is an increase in product net sales to customers in the aerospace industry 
the overall weak global economic conditions  particularly a decrease in demand from the asc group s customers in the oil gas and the power generation industries  negatively impacted contract service net sales in fiscal  compared with fiscal a portion of the asc group s business is conducted in europe and is denominated in local european currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rates between the local european currencies and the us dollar did not have a significant impact on net sales in fiscal the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to i higher depreciation and consulting costs related to the implementation of a company wide management information system during fiscal  ii higher expenses associated with uncollectible accounts receivable  and iii higher sales and marketing expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenditures for legal and professional services  incentive and research and development 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in operating income is principally due to the negative impact on margins from decreased net sales volumes that occurred in fiscal  compared with fiscal  without a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this negative impact was partially offset by the following changes in certain other components of the asc group s operating expenditures in fiscal  compared with fiscal year ended september  increase decrease operating expenditures material compensation and benefits operating costs benefited in fiscal  compared with fiscal  from i a decline in the asc group s material cost due primarily to the aforementioned decline in product sales and a product mix change away from products that contain precious metals and ii a decrease in expenditures for compensation and benefits due primarily to lower healthcare costs and a reduction in the number of employees 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other expenses that are not related to and  therefore  not allocated to the business segments  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal principally due to the following changes in certain components of these expenses year ended september  increase decrease corporate unallocated expenses compensation and benefit expenses consulting expenses ireland facility expenses the increase in corporate unallocated expenses in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal is principally due to i higher consulting expenses associated with the company s chief executive officer full year in fiscal and ii an increase in compensation and related benefit expenses due principally to higher incentive compensation and salary retirement plan expenses 
these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the activity of leasing the cork  ireland facility 
such activity was included in discontinued operations during the first nine months of fiscal  the period during which such facility was classified as held for sale 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  such facility was no longer classified as held for sale and  therefore  a million higher aggregate depreciation expense was recorded to account for both fiscal depreciation expense as well as prior period catch up depreciation 
other general interest expense was nominal in both fiscal and principally because there were no amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit agreement during either period 
other income  net consists principally of million of rental income earned from the lease of the cork  ireland facility 
the company believes that inflation did not materially affect its results of operations in either fiscal or  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal included in the million of income from continuing operations in fiscal was lifo income of million 
included in the million of income from continuing operations in fiscal was i million of expense related to an amicable business settlement of a product dispute that originated in fiscal  ii million of expense related to the impairment of a long lived asset and iii lifo expense of million 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for small aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal commercial product sales and other revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in net sales of airframe and turbine engine components for large aircraft is primarily attributable to the overall weak global economic conditions and the related impact such conditions have had on commercial aviation 
the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components 
the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was million related to the payment to a customer that i was made to achieve an amicable business settlement of a product dispute and ii that the company agreed to make as a business gesture of good faith and cooperation without admission of liability 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
the remaining million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was principally due to a million decrease in variable selling cost principally due to the decrease in net sales 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the acm group recorded million of expense related the impairment of a long lived asset 
the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were favorably impacted by i an approximate million reduction in the lifo expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  ii lower expenditures for natural gas principally due to lower consumption and iii the negative impact in fiscal  of the aforementioned million settlement expense and million impairment expense 
these improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of i higher manufacturing labor and benefits expense due to higher average levels of employment and ii an increase in other manufacturing overhead costs incurred in fiscal  compared with fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the repair group s decrease in net sales is primarily due to the overall weak global economic conditions 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the repair group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were positively impacted principally by i an increase in selling prices  ii million of income related to the favorable settlements of certain obligations and iii the improved management of operating expenses  principally labor costs 
although sales volumes were higher in fiscal  operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal by startup costs related to the production launch of a new component repair program 
as discussed in the company s form k filed on january   the company explored strategic alternatives for the repair group for the purpose of enhancing shareholder value 
the company conducted an orderly and comprehensive review and evaluation of strategic alternatives available to it  including a divestiture of the repair group 
applied surface concepts group asc group net sales decreased to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical metal finishing equipment and solutions  decreased million to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  customized selective electrochemical metal finishing contract service net sales decreased million to million  compared with million in fiscal the overall weak global economic conditions  particularly in the oil and gas industry  negatively impacted the asc group s net sales in fiscal a portion of the asc group s business is conducted in europe and is denominated in local european currencies  which have weakened in relation to the us dollar  resulting in an unfavorable currency impact on net sales in fiscal of approximately million 
the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to a reduction in compensation and benefit related expenses attributable to the elimination of certain positions and the temporary reduction of employee compensation 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal this decrease in operating income was principally due to the effect of lower net sales without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the million net decrease in fiscal is principally due to a million decrease in legal and professional expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal this decrease was partially offset by million of depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to an asset that was classified as held for sale  beginning in fiscal and through the third quarter of fiscal  for which no depreciation expense was required to be recorded while it was classified as held for sale 
other general interest expense from continuing operations was million in both fiscal and the following table sets forth the weighted average interest rates and weighted average outstanding balances under the company s revolving credit agreement in fiscal years and weighted average interest rate year ended september  weighted average outstanding balance year ended september  credit agreement revolving credit agreement n a n a million b 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september   compared with million at september   while short term investments increased to million at september   compared with zero at september  at september   million of the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries 
distributions from the company s non us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to statutory restriction  adverse tax consequences or other limitations 
the company s operating activities provided million of cash in fiscal  compared with million of cash provided by operating activities of which million was provided by continuing operations in fiscal the million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to i net income of million  ii million from the impact of such non cash items as depreciation expense  deferred taxes and lifo expense and iii a million decrease in inventory 
these changes in the components of working capital were due primarily to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i the relative timing of collections from customers  ii the collection of refundable income taxes and iii the relative timing of payments to suppliers and tax authorities 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of million by the acm group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
in addition to the million expended during fiscal  million has been committed as of september  the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will be within the range of to million and will relate principally to the further enhancement of production and product offering capabilities across all three of the company s business groups 
during fiscal  the company invested million to repurchase its common shares under a stock repurchase program initiated in june  at which time the company indicated that it was prepared to invest up to million to repurchase its shares 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company declared a special cash dividend of per common share  which will result in a cash expenditure of million during first quarter of fiscal at september   the company had an million revolving credit agreement with a bank  subject to sufficiency of collateral  which expires on january  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   no amount was outstanding and the company had million available under its million revolving credit agreement 
the company s revolving credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the us and a guarantee by its us subsidiaries 
under its revolving credit agreement with the bank  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitation  covenants as defined that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level and a minimum ebitda level 
the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  the company believes that cash flows from its operations together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements through the end of fiscal year c 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
d 
other contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period amounts in thousands other contractual obligations total up to year up to years up to years more than years debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total excluded from the foregoing other contractual obligations table are open purchase orders at september  for raw materials and supplies required in the normal course of business 
excluded from the foregoing other contractual obligations table is a million liability for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to determine at this time if and or when this amount  or any portion thereof  may become payable 
included in other long term liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september  is million of liabilities related to the company s defined benefit pension plans 
the company is expected to make contributions of approximately million to fund its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal e 
outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as the aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
the acm group is also dependent on the military aerospace industry 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry as well as government defense spending directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
after the recent two year period of negative operating results in the global commercial airline industry that was due in large part to the global economic downturn  the financial condition of the global commercial airline industry improved in with a return to profitability 
this return to profitability is due to strong demand in both air freight and passenger traffic resulting principally from improvements in both business and consumer confidence levels 
the improved confidence levels can be attributed to the subsiding of the global economic downturn 
during fiscal  both air freight and passenger traffic returned to pre recession levels 
the company supplies new and spare components for military aircraft 
military spending has continued to be strong and level in recent years 
as a result of continued military initiatives  there has been strong demand for both new and spare components for military customers 
the defense budget includes the planned elimination of certain military aircraft 
these eliminations are countered by the new programs being supported such as the tanker program  the f and v the air transport industry s long term outlook is for continued  steady growth 
such longer term outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine component repairs 
the air transport industry has recently benefited from several favorable trends  including i projected growth in air traffic  ii major replacement and refurbishment cycles driven by the desire for more fuel efficient aircraft and fleet commonality and iii relatively stable fuel prices 
recent improvement in aircraft capacity utilization is due to the increase in air freight and passenger traffic  which is driving demand for additional capacity 
while aircraft capacity was reduced sharply in  it has returned to the market at about the same pace as the growth in demand for such capacity 
the company believes this pattern should continue with the long term steady growth projected by the air transport industry 
the company s current outlook for the air transport industry is cautiously optimistic while the military segment remains stable  yet subject to potential changes in defense spending decisions 
however  the company believes that it is poised to take advantage of the resulting improvement in order demand from the commercial airframe and engine manufacturers if and when it may occur 
it is difficult to determine  at this time  the potential long term impact that the aforementioned factors may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
lack of continued improvement in the global economy could result in credit risk associated with serving the airlines and or their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that cash on hand  short term investments  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future 
f 
critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the company considers a critical accounting estimate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value  which could result in future impairment charges 
defined benefit pension plan expense the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these three defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans 
one significant assumption in determining net pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on i the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans investment portfolios and ii the targeted allocation of the respective plans assets 
the expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and market performance 
should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed expected rate  the company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and  accordingly  on its related future net pension expense 
another significant assumption in determining the net pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate for each plan is determined  as of the fiscal year end measurement date  using prevailing market spot rates from an appropriate yield curve with maturities corresponding to the expected timing date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans 
such corresponding spot rates are used to discount future years projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value 
a composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot rates 
the discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standards codification asc guidance related to accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september  and  the company s net deferred tax liability before any valuation allowance was million and a nominal amount  respectively

impact of newly issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued an accounting standard update asu no 
 which addresses certain implementation issues related to an entity s requirement to perform and disclose subsequent events procedures 
the asu i exempts entities that file their financial statements with the sec from disclosing the date through which subsequent events procedures have been performed and ii clarifies the circumstances in which an entity s financial statements would be considered restated and the entity would therefore be required to update its subsequent events evaluation 
the guidance provided by the fasb became effective immediately upon issuance  and the company has adopted its disclosure requirements within this form k for the year ended september  in january  the fasb issued asu no 
to improve disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends the asc related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment to the asc will add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels  and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to fair value hierarchy level measurements 
the asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
further  the asu amends guidance on employers disclosure requirements for plan assets for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement benefit plans 
under the new guidance it is required that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets 
this asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide fair value hierarchy level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures
