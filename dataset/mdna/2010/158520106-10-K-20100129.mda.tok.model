the company also publishes the herald dispatch daily newspaper in huntington  west virginia with a total daily and sunday circulation of approximately  and  respectively 
the company has grown through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
through such growth  the company has realized regional economies of scale  operational efficiencies  and exposure of its core products to new markets 
the company has acquired fifteen printing companies  eight office products and office furniture companies  one company with a combined emphasis on both printing and office products and office furniture  a paper distribution division which was subsequently sold in and a daily newspaper since its initial public offering on january  the company s net revenues consist primarily of sales of commercial printing  business forms  tags  other printed products  document output solutions including rendering  inserting and mailing  office supplies  office furniture  data products and office design services as well as newspaper revenues primarily from advertising and circulation 
the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to the customer 
newspaper advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions  in the period when advertising is printed or placed on web sites

the company s revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by variations in demand for its products 
the company s cost of sales primarily consists of raw materials  including paper  ink  pre press supplies and purchased office supplies  furniture and data products  and manufacturing costs including direct labor  indirect labor and overhead 
significant factors affecting the company s cost of sales include the costs of paper in printing  office supplies and the newspaper operations  costs of labor and other raw materials 
the company s operating costs consist of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs include salaries  commissions and wages for sales  customer service  accounting  administrative and executive personnel  rent  utilities  legal  audit  information systems equipment costs  software maintenance and depreciation 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
restatement of prior year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company identified approximately million or per share on a basic and diluted basis of non cash deferred tax related adjustments for accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for october  presented in this form k have been restated to increase deferred income tax expense and to increase deferred income tax liability 
this adjustment is related to the goodwill  tradename and masthead associated with the acquisition of the herald dispatch 
this deferred tax liability will remain on the balance sheet until such time as the associated intangible assets are impaired  sold or otherwise disposed of 
as a result of the impairment charge recorded in this deferred tax liability is now reflected as a deferred tax asset due to the non cash benefit associated with the impairment of goodwill  tradename and masthead 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company uses guidelines and applies requirements that are set forth in the asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and that the impact of recognizing impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows requires significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in the md a 
beginning in fiscal year  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill and other intangibles 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangibles 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  goodwill and other intangibles are recorded at the adjusted book value and were analyzed for impairment with the implementation of asc the fair value of the company s goodwill and other intangibles was estimated using both the market and income approaches 
the company determined that it should perform impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of  due  in part  to declines in our stock price  increased volatility in operating results and declines in market transactions in the industry 
based on the analysis and with the assistance of third party valuation specialists the company determined that the fair value relating to goodwill and other intangibles resulted in an implied fair value less than the book value recorded for the corresponding goodwill and other intangibles  and therefore  an impairment was recognized in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million or million net of deferred tax benefit 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill and other intangibles impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  asc requires that the goodwill and other intangibles be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
management has discussed the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  the board of directors has reviewed this disclosure and its relation to md a 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company encounters risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  the company compares the identified credit risks with the allowance that has been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
management has discussed the development and selection of this estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the board has  in turn  reviewed the disclosure and its relation to md a 
during  and    and  of bad debt expense was incurred and the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  of october   and the actual write offs for the periods were   and  during  and general economic conditions and specific geographic and customer concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in the financial position and results of operations of the company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations  including certain information presented as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended october  in thousands restated revenues printing office products and office furniture newspaper    total revenues cost of sales newspaper operating costs printing office products and office furniture newspaper cost of sales operating costs   total cost of sales and newspaper operating costs gross profit selling general and administrative expenses asset impairment costs  hurricane and relocation costs  net of recoveries loss income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income year ended october  compared to year ended october  restated revenues consolidated net revenues were million for the year ended october  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this change represents a decrease in revenues of approximately million  or 
printing revenues decreased by million or from million in to million in the decrease in printing sales was primarily due to the continued impact of the global economic crisis 
office products and office furniture revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in revenues for the office products and office furniture segment was primarily attributable to lower sales in both office products and office furniture 
in  newspaper revenues were composed of approximately million in advertising revenue and million in circulation revenue compared to the same period in  in which the newspaper revenues were composed of approximately million in advertising revenue and million in circulation revenues 
cost of sales total cost of sales for the year ended october  totaled million compared to million in the previous year 
this change represented a decrease of million or in cost of sales 
printing cost of sales decreased million to million in compared to million in printing cost of sales was lower due to lower sales partially offset by higher cost of goods sold as a percent of print sales 
printing cost of sales as a percentage of printing sales increased to as a percent of printing sales in from in this increase was primarily the result of higher material  overhead and labor costs as a percent of printing sales 
office products and office furniture cost of sales decreased million to million in from million in the decrease in office products and office furniture cost of sales is attributable to a decrease in office products and office furniture sales 
the increase in office products and office furniture cost of sales as a percent of office products and office furniture sales is primarily reflective of higher furniture and office products costs as a percent of furniture and office products sales 
newspaper cost of sales and operating cost decreased  to million in from million in newspaper cost of sales and operating costs as a percentage of newspaper sales were in and in operating expenses and income selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses decreased million to million in from million in s  g a as a percentage of net sales represented of net sales in compared with of net sales in this decrease in selling  general and administrative costs is primarily due to various cost reduction initiatives primarily reflective of payroll related reductions 
these reductions were initiated in part to address the impact of the global economic crisis and the associated reduction in sales 
in accordance with asc topic  a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in the first step  a comparison is made of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  the second step of the impairment test is required 
in the second step  an estimate of the current fair values of all assets and liabilities is made to determine the amount of implied goodwill and consequently the amount of any goodwill impairment 
in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets conducted in the fourth quarter of in accordance with asc topic  we recorded a charge of million million  net of deferred tax benefit for impairment of the value of the goodwill and other intangible assets  which resulted from the acquisition of the herald dispatch daily newspaper in huntington  wv 
this charge resulted in impairment charges of trademarks and masthead of million  subscriber base asset of million  advertiser base asset of million and goodwill of million  the associated deferred tax benefit of these charges approximated million 
the valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the newspaper operating segment was based on both the market and income approach 
the income approach was based off a discounted cash flow methodology  in which expected future free net cash flows to invested capital are discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital 
the market approach using a guideline company analysis weighs empirical evidence from shares of comparable companies sold in minority transactions on stock exchanges and merger and acquisition analysis  which analyses sales of newspapers in control transactions 
the company then undertook the next step in the impairment testing process by determining the fair value of assets and liabilities within this reporting unit 
the implied fair values of goodwill for this reporting unit was less than the carrying amount by million million net of deferred tax benefit  and therefore an impairment charge in this amount was taken 
the goodwill and other intangible assets will continue to be amortized for tax purposes over its remaining life in accordance with applicable internal revenue service standards 
the company has other reporting units within goodwill 
the company evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarter of  and while the estimated fair value of these reporting units declined from  the estimated fair value of each of our other reporting units exceeded carrying values in as a result  no additional testing or impairment charges were necessary 
during  the us recession had a negative impact on the company s operations across multiple segment lines 
the newspaper operating segment reflected lower operating revenues in both advertising and circulation 
in response to this difficult operating environment champion initiated a cost reduction plan and eliminated employee positions or approximately of the workforce at the champion publishing subsidiary 
the company also incurred asset impairment charges from property  plant and equipment of approximately  or  net of tax or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
other income expense other expense increased approximately  from million in to million in this was primarily due to charges associated with ineffectiveness in the interest rate swap hedge due to the elimination of the libor borrowing option by the administrative agent of the credit agreement partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of  from  in to  in the decrease in interest expense was attributed to the acquisition of the herald dispatch which was completed on september  and was reflective of lower benchmark rates and debt offset partially by increased applicable margins due to the implementation of the default rate by the administrative agent 
the loss reclassified to other expense from other comprehensive income approximated million  net of tax or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were a benefit of in compared with an expense of in the income tax benefit expense rate is reflective of deferred tax benefits associated with impairment charges of the herald dispatch partially offset by deferred tax liabilities representing timing changes associated with goodwill and other non amortizing assets with indefinite lives being recorded as deferred tax liabilities

the forbearance agreement also required marshall t 
reynolds to lend to the company  in exchange for a subordinated unsecured promissory note in like amount  payment of principal and interest on which is prohibited until payment of all liabilities under the credit agreement 
this  was applied to prepayment of  of the company s loans 
this subordinated unsecured promissory note bearing interest at the wall street journal prime rate currently and maturing september   and a debt subordination agreement  both dated december   have been executed and delivered  and mr 
reynolds has advanced  to the company 
the company paid to the administrative agent a nonrefundable forbearance fee of  upon closing of the forbearance agreement 
the company had borrowed under its million line of credit approximately million at october  which encompassed refinancing of existing indebtedness prior to the herald dispatch acquisition and to partially fund the purchase of the herald dispatch 
pursuant to the borrowing base calculation and reflective of the terms of the forbearance agreement and the credit agreement and exclusive of any reserves which may be implemented by the administrative agent in its sole discretion the company was notified pursuant to the filing of its december  borrowing base of an additional million reserve being instituted by the administrative agent  the company had million in additional availability under its million revolving credit line subject to the million excess availability threshold pursuant to the terms of the forbearance agreement as of october  the company has an additional million unsecured line of credit available with another bank that expires in july as of october   the company had contractual obligations in the form of leases and debt as follows payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations residual total non cancelable operating leases revolving line of credit  term debt the company is required to make certain mandatory payments on its credit facilities related to net proceeds received from a loss subject to applicable thresholds  equity proceeds and effective january   the company is required to prepay its credit facilities by of excess cash flow for its most recently completed fiscal year 
the excess cash flow for purposes of this calculation is defined as the difference if any between a ebitda for such period and b federal  state and local income taxes paid in cash during such period plus capital expenditures during such period not financed with indebtedness plus interest expense paid in cash during such period plus the aggregate amount of scheduled payments made by the borrower and its subsidiaries during such period in respect of all principal on all indebtedness whether at maturity  as a result of mandatory sinking fund redemption  or otherwise  plus restricted payments paid in cash by the borrower during such period in compliance with the credit agreement 
the company has no prepayment obligation due january  pursuant to the applicable calculations 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for the years ended october   and were million  million  and million 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal compared to was primarily associated with a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year compared to was primarily associated with higher depreciation and amortization  deferred financing costs  deferred income taxes  and bad debt expense 
the impairment costs associated primarily with the acquisition of the herald dispatch had no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended october   and cash flows used in investing activities were down approximately million in from the cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to capital expenditures offset by proceeds from cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased in compared to and for both periods the cash flows were primarily associated with purchases of property and equipment and payments for businesses acquired in previous periods 
cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities for the years ended october   and were million  million  and million 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily associated with less payments made on the company s outstanding indebtedness associated with its revolving credit facility and the elimination of the company s dividend in the second quarter of the million utilized for financing activities in was primarily reflective of net payments on debt and dividends partially offset by negative book cash balances and stock option proceeds 
during  the company reduced net borrowings by approximately million after adjusting for non cash investing and financing activities 
this  coupled with dividend payments of  was reflective of net cash used in financing activities during dividends paid in   and were million  million  and million 
inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  an increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we expect to continue to be reflected in our operating results in future periods 
historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its profitability in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter 
on a historical basis the herald dispatch s first and third calendar quarters of the year tended to be the weakest because advertising volume is at its lowest levels following the holiday season and a seasonal slowdown in the summer months 
correspondingly  on a historical basis the fourth calendar quarter followed by the second calendar quarter tended to be the strongest quarters 
the fourth calendar quarter includes heavy holiday season advertising 
other factors that affect our quarterly revenues and operating results may be beyond our control  including changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  the hiring and retention of key personnel  wage and cost pressures  distribution costs  changes in newsprint prices and general economic factors 
the united states economy has been in a recession since december  according to the national bureau of economic research  and it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  were in decline before that time 
the duration and depth of an economic recession in markets in which the company operates may further reduce its future advertising and circulation revenue  operating results and cash flows 
newly issued accounting standards fasb asc topic in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of sfas no 
this statement establishes two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  authoritative and not 
the fasb accounting standards codification the codification became the source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  with the exceptions of rules and interpretive guidelines issued by the sec  which are authoritative for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative for interim and annual reporting as of september  the company began using the codification  for financial reporting  as of the fiscal year ended october  as the codification is not intended to change any standards outlined in gaap  but only to organize and unify existing standards  this did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
fasb asc topic business combinations asc formerly sfas no 
and its revision r changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
asc as it relates to recognizing all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  costs an acquirer expects but it not obligated to incur in the future to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate or relocate an acquiree s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date but must be expensed in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  during the measurement period  which should not exceed one year from the acquisition date  any adjustments that are needed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of that date will be adjusted retrospectively 
the acquirer will be required to expense all acquisition related costs in the periods such costs are incurred other than costs to issue debt or equity securities 
asc will have no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows at the date of adoption  but it could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the future when it is applied to acquisitions which occur in the fiscal year beginning november  fasb asc topic in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  and has subsequently been codified under fasb asc  determining the useful life of an intangible asset and is hereon referred to as asc  amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of asc is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset as outlined by the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  we will adopt asc as of november  we do not expect this to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows at the date of adoption  but it could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods
