table of contents industry background malocclusion malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth  is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions  affecting approximately to of the population of major developed countries or nearly a billion individuals 
approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide  of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served market 
while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance  malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay  tooth loss  gum disease  jaw joint pain and headaches 
because of the compromised aesthetics  discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments  only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 
traditional orthodontic treatment in the us  dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
occasionally  dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic  tooth colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside  or lingual surfaces  of the patient s teeth 
dental professionals also augment braces with elastics  metal bands  headgear and other ancillary devices 
the average treatment takes approximately to months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement  or chair time 
to initiate treatment  a dental professional will diagnose a patient s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan 
in a subsequent visit  the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient s teeth with a bonding agent and attach an arch wire to the brackets 
thereafter  by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks  the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement 
in a final visit  the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient s teeth 
upon completion of the treatment  the dental professional may  at his or her discretion  have the patient use a retainer 
fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us  to  with a median fee of approximately  generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance 
fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional s estimate of chair time  and are generally negotiated in advance 
a treatment that exceeds the dental professional s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time  and reduced profitability for the dental professional 
limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions  they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages 
traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with unattractive appearance 
braces call attention to the patient s condition and treatment 
in addition  braces trap food  which can further compromise appearance 
braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth 
as a result of these and other limitations  relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment and braces can compromise the self esteem of young adults and teenagers 
oral discomfort 
braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth 
the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort  especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 
poor oral hygiene 
braces can make it difficult to brush and floss leaving teeth vulnerable to developing decay  plaque  periodontal disease and stains that must be taken care of after braces are removed 
additionally  the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth 
inability to project treatment 
historically  dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment 
accordingly  dental professionals must rely on intuition 
table of contents and judgment to plan and project treatment 
as a result  they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits 
this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional s ability to estimate the duration of treatment 
because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis  extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 
physical demands on dental professional 
the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity  and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional 
root resorption 
the sustained high levels of force associated with traditional treatment can result in root resorption  which is a shortening of tooth roots 
this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient 
emergencies 
at times  brackets and wires need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis 
such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
due to the poor aesthetics  discomfort and other limitations of braces  relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment 
additionally  teenagers that seek orthodontic treatment have traditionally only had the option of braces for treatment 
accordingly  we believe there is a large unmet need for an alternative orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns 
the invisalign solution invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion 
the invisalign system is comprised of several phases  the principal steps of which are the creation of customized digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as clincheck  which occurs in our facility in san jose  costa rica  and the manufacturing of customized invisalign aligners  which occurs in our facility in juarez  mexico 
orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us 
in an initial patient visit  the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment 
the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinyl siloxane  or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches  x rays of the patient s dentition  photographs of the patient  a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form  or prescription 
the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the three dimensional geometry of the patient s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners 
an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material 
this material hardens  capturing the shape of the patient s teeth 
the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system  describing the desired positions and movement of the patient s teeth 
the dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in juarez  mexico 
preparation of three dimensional computer models of the patient s initial malocclusion 
upon receipt  we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient s dentition 
using computed tomography  known as ct scanning  we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital  three dimensional computer model of the patient s current dentition 
we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facility in san jose  costa rica 
preparation of computer simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck 
in costa rica  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
this simulated treatment plan  called clincheck  is an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients 
this clincheck simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards 
upon completion of the review  the patient s clincheck is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip  our proprietary customer interfacing software portal  which is available on our websites located at www 
invisalign 
com and www 
aligntech 
com 
the dental professional then reviews the clincheck and can either 
table of contents accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment plan 
clincheck allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle 
accordingly  clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets 
by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation  the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and  thus participates in the customized design of the aligners 
at this point  the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the treatment plan  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment 
the dental professional s final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners in juarez  mexico 
construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck simulation  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography technology  to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient s teeth 
each mold is a replica of the patient s teeth at each two week stage of the simulated course of treatment 
these molds are then used to fabricate the patient s aligners 
manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional 
from these molds  aligners are fabricated by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each mold 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck 
each aligner covers a patient s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn 
aligners are commonly worn in pairs  over the upper and lower dental arches 
aligners are generally worn for consecutive two week periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation 
after two weeks of use  the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series  advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage 
this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete 
when treating with invisalign full  invisalign express and invisalign teen  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
for invisalign assist  aligners are manufactured in batches based on a progress tracking feature integrated into invisalign assist 
when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
in certain cases  dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with tooth colored attachments bonded to the patient s teeth 
these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 
we provide an aligner like template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient s teeth where needed 
also  in cases where interproximal reduction  or ipr  is required or requested by the dental professional  we provide an ipr treatment form  quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction  location  and timing of ipr 
retention 
upon completion of the treatment  the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product 
vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period 
our products our revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings 
percentage of revenues by product fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year invisalign full invisalign express invisalign teen invisalign assist other total 
table of contents invisalign full 
invisalign full is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions 
each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctor s treatment goals 
for invisalign full  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign express 
invisalign express is a lower cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases 
invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners 
invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
for invisalign express  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign teen 
invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or teen treatment market 
invisalign teen includes features such as compliance indicators to help gauge patient wear and compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth common in teen patients 
predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients  these features are intended to meet the treatment needs of those younger patients 
as part of invisalign teen  we include up to six free individual replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss 
for invisalign teen  aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign assist 
invisalign assist is designed specifically for gps who want more support in selecting  monitoring and finishing invisalign cases 
intended to help newly trained and lower volume gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice  invisalign assist is intended to make it easier for gps to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach  submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks 
in addition  progress tracking features allow gps to submit new impressions every nine stages 
when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
retention 
in addition to our traditional single retainer product  we offer vivera retainers  where we deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year 
vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners  and offer an effective  aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and non invisalign patients 
training  ancillary and other 
the remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products  such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 
proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form k such as clincheck and vip virtual invisalign practice are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 
benefits of invisalign we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 
benefits to the dental professional ability to visualize the treatment plan and treatment options 
clincheck enables dental professionals to preview and modify the intended outcome of treatment in an interactive three dimensional computer model 
clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient 

table of contents expanded patient base 
we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics 
currently  approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide  of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served market 
as of december   our share of the million patients in our served market is approximately 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations 
we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  adults  who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  will be more likely to seek treatment 
we therefore believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 
in addition  as the primary care provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base 
practice productivity 
we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients  they will be able to better leverage their existing resources  including staff time and office space resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity 
benefits to the patient excellent aesthetics 
aligners are nearly invisible when worn  significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional braces 
comfort 
by replacing the six week adjustment cycle of traditional braces with two week stages  aligners move teeth more gently 
also  aligners are thin  smooth and low in profile 
as a result  aligners are more comfortable and less irritating than traditional braces 
improved oral hygiene 
patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with traditional braces  such as eating  brushing and flossing 
we believe this feature has the potential to reduce enamel decalcification  tooth decay  and periodontal damage during treatment  which may result from traditional fixed braces 
potentially reduced overall treatment time 
aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth 
in addition  the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements 
together  these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to traditional braces 
potentially reduced root resorption 
we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption  which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure that can occur during orthodontic treatment 
reduced incidence of emergencies 
typically  a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series  minimizing inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces or as an alternative  more aesthetic treatment option for teenagers 
limitations of invisalign in some instances  the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment 
aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces  and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment 
depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected  the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces 
dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan 
once a dental professional submits a case to us  there are a variety of factors that may impact when the corresponding aligners are delivered  one of which includes the timing of when the dental professional 
table of contents accepts the case 
aligners may not be appropriate for all cases  such as severe malocclusion  which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results 
in addition  because aligners are removable  treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended 
some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech 
in some instances  patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums  cheeks and lips and in some rare instances  allergic reactions have been reported 
we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 
our target market and patient base our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations 
we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  adults  who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity 
with the launch of invisalign teen in july  we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the non adult comprehensive  or younger teen  treatment market 
invisalign teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontist s patient base  which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market 
approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served market 
twenty three percent of these patients  or approximately  have mature dentition adults and older teens  with fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth 
seventy seven percent  or approximately million  have erupting dentition non adult comprehensive  or younger teens  with partially erupted second molars  cuspid and second bicuspid teeth 
as of december   our share of the million patients in our served market is approximately 
published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited  however  as the primary care provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base 
we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 
as of december   approximately  patients cumulatively worldwide have started treatment using invisalign 
the invisalign system is sold in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and japan 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note segments and geographical information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we operate as one reportable segment the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of invisalign 
additionally  no single customer accounted for or more of our total net revenues in   and business strategy our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives continue to accelerate product and technology innovation in order to extend clinical effectiveness and treat more patients and achieve better outcomes  enhance the customer experience for our doctors and for their staff by making it easier and more efficient to adopt invisalign into their practice and increase utilization  drive more efficient consumer demand creation  improve conversion rates and re fresh the invisalign brand image and positioning  and continue to drive european growth while opening up additional new markets around the world 

table of contents product innovation and clinical effectiveness 
we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future long term goal to drive and sustain product adoption 
our primary channels gps and orthodontists each have distinct and separate needs 
specifically  orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system 
on the other hand  typical gps want greater ease of use  more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools  guidance through the case set up process  minimal treatment intervention and self help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion 
based on this knowledge we announced two new products in to address these distinct needs 
in july  we released invisalign teen which is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or younger teen market 
predominantly marketed to the orthodontist  the launch of a teen specific product makes the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontist s patient base  which we believe will increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market over time 
invisalign teen has grown from of our total case volume when it was introduced in to of our total case volume in and we expect that orthodontists will continue to adopt invisalign teen slowly  after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes 
in october  we announced the release of invisalign assist  which is intended to help newly trained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice 
invisalign assist features are intended to make it easier for doctors to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach 
in october  additional features were added or enhanced in invisalign assist that are intended to expand the capabilities of invisalign assist and give doctors the confidence and control necessary to treat a wider range of patients 
we also introduced new and enhanced features in all other invisalign products 
the new product line features are designed to overcome barriers to treatment by addressing clinical issues that some orthodontists and gps have traditionally perceived as challenging in invisalign treatment  such as extrusion and rotation of teeth  root movements and interproximal reduction ipr 
we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization or same practice sales of invisalign  however  we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years 
we continue to make significant progress with new products and features for invisalign  yet total invisalign case starts are still small relative to our total served market 
during  we plan to continue our efforts to demonstrate clinical efficacy and work towards a long term goal of becoming the orthodontic treatment of choice 
enhancing the customer experience and increasing adoption 
we are committed to enhancing the customer experience by focusing on specific customer touch points  or areas where we interact directly with our customers 
specifically  we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs  improving customer support  providing field sales support and helping doctors with practice development on how to better integrate invisalign into their practice 
clinical education and training 
ensuring that trained doctors are confident in using the invisalign system is a key driver toward our ultimate goal of increasing product adoption 
we continuously update our training programs to address the needs of our customers 
for instance  we developed a pre training course intended to familiarize doctors with the invisalign system prior to attending the full training course 
in addition  we recently updated our initial training program  clear essentials i  by focusing on invisalign assist  instead of invisalign full  since we believe invisalign assist is the right product for newly trained gps 
we anticipate that by using invisalign assist  newly trained gps will exit this initial training program with increased confidence in prescribing invisalign treatment 
our new doctor training in north america is evolving to identify and focus on practices that are interested in gaining the skills and experience necessary to be successful with invisalign 
in the past  many doctors completed this training course as a means of learning more about invisalign or leveraging the marketing benefits of invisalign  but then only sporadically submitted cases 
building on our experience with the proficiency requirements  we expect that in the future doctors are more likely to attend our clear essentials i training course when they are actually ready to begin using invisalign in their practices right away 
as a result  over time  we believe we are likely to have a more focused  
table of contents engaged and committed customer base that maintains a baseline of up to date invisalign product knowledge 
we have also incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of university programs 
by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
other resources that we offer our doctors include the aligntech institute program www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training 
these clinical education and practice development training opportunities include instructor led training classes  seminars and workshops  conference calls  web based videos  case studies  and other clinical resources 
many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits 
additionally  our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as up to date support information  programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 
customer support and practice development 
once a doctor is trained  we provide additional services to help our customers increase their confidence in using the invisalign system through clinical support and continuing education  as well as improving their practice management skills 
at our costa rica facility  we have over treatment technicians and customer support staff available to help our customers with their cases and treatment plans 
our sales representatives provide additional support and practice development tools such as staff training  clincheck software tips and tools  practice marketing guides and marketing materials  as well as any assistance with the invisalign system process 
becoming a leading invisalign provider 
our goal is to help ensure that every practice that works with invisalign can achieve great clinical and commercial outcomes and that every patient in invisalign treatment gets the smile they want 
on june   we announced the implementation of the invisalign product proficiency requirements or the proficiency requirements in north america to help ensure that invisalign trained doctors have the experience and confidence necessary to achieve high quality treatment outcomes for invisalign patients 
under the proficiency requirements  every invisalign provider in north america must have invisalign case starts measured by clincheck acceptance and complete at least invisalign specific continuing education ce credits each calendar year 
doctors who met the proficiency requirements of case starts and invisalign ce hours by the end of will benefit from a new addition to align s consumer marketing programs  one that encourages prospective patients to seek out invisalign preferred providers 
starting in january  this new invisalign preferred designation will be highlighted on the invisalign web site and in television ads as a way to recognize doctors commitment to continued proficiency with invisalign 
the invisalign preferred designation will then be awarded on an annual basis to doctors who meet the proficiency requirements for a given year 
in october  we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a one time  additional six month qualification period for doctors who were unable to meet the proficiency requirements for  but demonstrated a desire to continue using invisalign 
the additional six month qualification period stipulated that doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june   provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least case starts and invisalign ce hours between january and june  doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least case starts and invisalign ce hours by the end of to qualify as providers for the following year 
doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of were not eligible for the additional qualification period 
they will be able to continue treating in progress cases but will not be 
table of contents able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources 
doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign clear essentials i training and meeting the proficiency requirements during the new calendar year 
as of january  approximately  doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another  doctors met the criteria for the additional six month qualification period in we limited the account status of approximately  doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements but can continue treating and finishing in progress patients 
in addition  we deactivated approximately  invisalign trained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case 
see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k for risks related to the proficiency requirements 
increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and re freshing the invisalign brand 
marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving long term growth 
our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers  we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign 
historically  our marketing programs have been directed to an adult audience  however  with the introduction of invisalign teen  this past year we directed our communication efforts directly to teens and their parents 
we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or pull for invisalign 
in  we became more efficient in our approach and grew overall lead generation and awareness on lower total spending 
we also shifted our marketing mix from conventional media towards more digital marketing and social networking activity 
we introduced a new public relations program for invisalign teen  launched a teen specific website and leveraged online and mobile widgets  social media and blogs directly targeted to teens 
we believe that consumer demand creation is a key component to our long term growth 
as a result  we will continue to invest in efforts to increase consumer awareness of invisalign through a variety of media outlets 
we will continue to drive consumer demand among the adult population primarily though our conventional media programs  and increasingly leverage digital and event marketing and social networking activity to directly target teens and their parents 
additionally  we are evolving the invisalign brand strategy while refreshing the invisalign look and feel 
we are introducing a new and more modern logo and new brand positioning focused on treatment outcome and practice growth 
as part of this effort  in january  we completely updated our consumer website  www 
invisalign 
com  www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  and www 
invisalign 
com teen and base marketing materials 
preferred providers will be the first customers to be able to utilize the new invisalign branding for use in their own marketing 
growth of international markets 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets  europe and japan 
similar to the north america market  our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to become an invisalign provider and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices 
through december   we have trained over  doctors  predominantly orthodontists in core europe  our primary international market 
product line expansion is key to providing doctors a solution that addresses a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility 
in march  we announced the availability of invisalign teen for invisalign trained doctors worldwide  except for japan 
as a result  we expect the addressable market for our product to expand and ultimately increase adoption 
in addition  we will carry on our efforts to increase brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign 
additionally  although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales  approximately of our international sales are through distributors covering smaller international markets  specifically asia pacific and latin america 
we will consider selling through distributors in other smaller or less strategic markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case by case basis 
for example  we recently announced the addition of an international distributor for smaller country markets in europe  the middle east and africa 
with these efforts  we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
in  our international sales increased from of net revenues to of net revenues

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process 
in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products  we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 
throughput management because we manufacture each case on a build to order basis  we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand 
to increase throughput  we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 
in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate limiting processes  or bottlenecks 
we continue to upgrade our proprietary  three dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case  thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica 
we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez  mexico 
in order to scale our manufacturing capacity  we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 
quality assurance align s quality system is in compliance with food drug administration s medical device regulations  cfr part  and health canada s medical device regulations 
we are certified to en iso  internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing 
we have a formal  documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined  understood and achieved 
systems  processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality 
we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes  taking corrective action  as needed 
since we custom manufacture aligners on a build to order basis  we do not offer refunds on our products 
because each clincheck and each aligner is unique  we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process  to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations 
aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty  which covers defects in materials and workmanship 
our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed 
in the event aligners fall within the 
table of contents scope of the invisalign product warranty  we will replace the aligners at our expense 
our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended 
if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners  and as a result  requests additional invisalign treatment  the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 
warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient s dentition to us 
we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve  from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 
the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 
actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan 
deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors  such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 
sales and marketing we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs  mail campaigns  trade shows  trade journals and print media  and to consumers through advertising  digital media  event marketing and social networking activities 
based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales  we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 
professional marketing we provide training  marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps throughout north america and internationally 
as of december   we had trained  dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign 
of those trained dental professionals  approximately are dental professionals in our north american market 
within our north american market  we have trained  orthodontists and  gps cumulatively through the end of as part of the proficiency requirements  in january  we deactivated approximately  invisalign trained doctors who had never submitted an invisalign case 
in addition  we limited the account status of approximately  doctors who did not meet either the proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements but can continue treating and finishing in progress patients 
see discussion of invisalign product proficiency requirements in item business business strategy becoming a leading invisalign provider 
as of december  our north american sales organization consisted of people  of which were direct sales representatives and were sales administration and management 
internationally  we had people engaged in sales and sales support as of december  we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets 
for instance  we use distributors for the sale of our products in part of the asia pacific and latin american regions 
we have also recently announced the addition of an international distributor in the smaller country markets in europe  the middle east and africa 
we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case by case basis 
invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment 
our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format 
the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability  instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form  clinical tips and techniques  guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 
after doctors complete their training  sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases 
these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions  treatment planning processes and familiarizing 
table of contents them with our dental online portals and tools 
sales representatives may also provide practice building assistance  including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media 
many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 
consumer marketing our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from these primary sources an orthodontist  a gp  consumer marketing and advertising  our websites  which can be accessed at either www 
invisalign 
com  www 
invisalignteen 
com  www 
aligntech 
com  or www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  direct to consumer mail and digital advertising  public relations efforts  and other invisalign patients 
research and development our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of clinical effectiveness and applicability of invisalign  enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines  including the development of distinct product platforms for the gps and orthodontists such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen 
our research and development expenses were million for  million for  and million for in an effort to demonstrate invisalign s broad treatment capabilities  various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases  including those of severe complexity 
we are also undertaking post marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 
as mentioned in our business strategy  we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase adoption and utilization of invisalign 
intellectual property we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 
we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 
our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 

table of contents seasonal fluctuations seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases  particularly in europe 
in addition  summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients 
many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year 
as a result  adult appointments  including adult invisalign patient starts  are often pushed further into late summer or early fall 
however  with the availability of invisalign teen  was the first summer we were able to actively compete for a share of teen patient starts 
we believe that invisalign teen may have helped and may in the future help moderate the historical downward trend we have typically seen for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months 
these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause  fluctuations in our quarterly results  including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 
backlog due to the nature of our business  we maintain relatively low levels of backlog 
the period from which treatment data or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital treatment plan  or clincheck  is dependent on the dental professional s discretion to modify  accept or cancel the treatment plan 
therefore  we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved clincheck 
our backlog consists of clincheck approved cases  which are generally shipped within a short period of time 
as a result  we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales  and our quarterly revenues depend largely on the timing of clincheck approvals and the impact on cases shipped in that quarter 
competition we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets  which include m s unitek  danaher corporation s sybron dental specialties  and dentsply international  inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign  including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties a division of danaher corporation 
in the future  we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign 
information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
we believe that in addition to price  the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  effectiveness of treatment  customer support  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use  and dental professionals chair time 
we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 

table of contents government regulation fda s quality system regulation for medical devices 
the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device 
in  we received pre market clearance from the fda pursuant to the k pre market notification procedure  allowing us to market the product in the us the invisalign system was originally cleared for use by the fda in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition  severe overbite  severe overjet  tooth malocclusion requiring surgical correction  adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw  and adult patients with dental prosthetics implants 
in  the fda cleared new labeling for the invisalign system  by removing the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use 
in addition  certain conditions previously listed as contraindications will now be listed as precautions 
we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations  record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system 
we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements 
we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 
if the fda determines that we failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions  including but not limited to financial penalties  withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 
health canada s medical device regulations 
in canada  we are required to comply with health canada s medical device regulations 
our products are registered with health canada 
we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 
european union s mdd requirements iso in europe  invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such  we follow the requirements of the medical device directives 
we are iso certified  which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 
health insurance portability and accountability act of under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information 
confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  referred to as the privacy standard  and other state laws and regulations 
the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information 
although compliance is the responsibility of the hospital  physician or other healthcare provider  we understand the importance to our customers and their patients of maintaining the confidentiality of patient information 
accordingly  we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations 
maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients 
additionally  our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws 
as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
we are a medical device manufacturer subject to us food and drug administration regulations 
these regulations  among other things  require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products as permitted by our fda clearances 
furthermore  our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects 
for example  the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be 
table of contents used by us  released for inclusion in our databases  or released by us to third parties  are subject to substantial regulation by state governments 
these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly 
in addition  provisions under the federal anti kickback statute prohibit  among other things  paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in  or for the order  purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by  medicare  medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs 
most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws 
these laws  which are evolving at the federal and state levels  are applicable to our financial relationships with  and any marketing or other promotional activities involving  our dental professional customers 
violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 
employees as of december   we had  employees  including  in manufacturing and operations  in sales and marketing  in research and development and in general and administrative functions

table of contents item a 
risk factors we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues  and any decline in sales of invisalign for any reason  including as a result of the introduction of the proficiency requirements or a continued weakness in general economic conditions  or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues  gross margin and net profits 
we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists  gps and consumers is critical to our future success 
if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services  if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate  if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines  our operating results would be harmed 
factors that could cause the adoption of invisalign to occur at a lower rate than we expect  as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 
consumers may not adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 
consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may  among other things  result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
in addition  invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment  and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment 
we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists  gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion  but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients 
increased market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals  as well as other factors including effectiveness  safety  ease of use  reliability  aesthetics  greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 
orthodontists and gps may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate for a number of reasons  including the introduction of the proficiency requirements or continued weakness in general economic conditions 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization 
we have a large number of low volume doctors that make up a large portion of our customer base 
we want every invisalign provider to be one we can comfortably direct a prospective patient to with an expectation of knowledgeable treatment and a great outcome 
on june   we announced the implementation of the invisalign proficiency requirements or the proficiency requirements in north america to help ensure that invisalign trained doctors have the experience and confidence necessary to achieve high quality treatment outcomes for invisalign patients 
under the proficiency requirements  every invisalign provider in north america must have invisalign case starts measured by clincheck acceptance and complete at least invisalign specific continuing education ce credits each calendar year 
in october  we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a one time  additional six month qualification period stipulating that for those doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june   provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least case starts and invisalign ce hours between january and june  doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least case starts and invisalign ce 
table of contents hours by the end of to qualify as providers for the following year 
doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of were not eligible for the additional qualification period 
they will be able to continue treating in progress cases but will not be able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources 
doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign training and meeting the proficiency requirements 
as of january  approximately  doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another  doctors met the criteria for the additional six month qualification period in we limited the account status of approximately  doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements 
these doctors can continue treating and finishing in progress patients 
in addition  we deactivated approximately  invisalign trained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case 
although we want every doctor to achieve and maintain the proficiency requirements with invisalign  we expect that a number of our lower volume doctors may choose not to meet these requirements 
as a result  the proficiency requirements may result in greater variability among customer activity  particularly in the second half of after the additional six month qualification period expires on june  if the number of our customers who fail to maintain and or increase utilization to meet the proficiency requirements is greater than we anticipate  our case volumes will decrease and our revenues will be harmed 
in addition  if gps and orthos do not attend our training courses in sufficient numbers for any reason  including the introduction of the proficiency requirements  or continued weakness in general economic conditions  our revenue may fail to grow as expected 
in addition  increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice 
if adoption and utilization does not increase as we anticipate  our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 
the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 
one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization  or the adoption and frequency of use  of the invisalign system by new and existing customers 
if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate  our operating results could be harmed 
we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 
in response to challenges in our business  including increased competition  we have in the past reduced the list price of our products 
we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors 
in addition  we sell a number of products at different list prices 
if we introduce any price reductions  expand our discount programs in the future  if participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or newer products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue  our average selling price would be adversely affected and our revenues  gross margin and net profits losses may be reduced 
furthermore  although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates 
as a result  negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods  the market price for our common stock may decline 
if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods  we will need to continue to increase our revenues  while controlling our expenses 
while we generated positive operating cash flow in and in  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations  from period to period  in 
table of contents the future 
because our business is evolving  it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth  and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates 
if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers practices from quarter to quarter  disruptions to our business due to the impact of an epidemic  such as the hn virus  that results in changes in consumer spending habits  consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office  as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the united states economy and global economies  changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which  given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments  could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the us dollar  changes in product mix  seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of marketing programs from quarter to quarter  changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized  including as a result of the introduction of new products or promotions or as a result of changes to critical accounting estimates or new accounting pronouncements  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity  any disruptions in the manufacturing process  including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or natural or other disasters beyond our control  the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  aggressive price competition from competitors  costs and expenditures in connection with litigation  inaccurate forecasting of revenues  production and other operating costs  and investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
most of our 
table of contents expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations  whether caused by changes in consumer spending  consumer preferences  weakness in the us or global economies  changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product  or other factors  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  market  and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products 
we launched invisalign teen in july and invisalign assist in october in october  we introduced new and enhanced features in all invisalign products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
in addition  even if our new products are successfully introduced  it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient 
since it takes approximately to months to treat a patient  our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 
a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 
we are dependent on commercial freight carriers  primarily ups  to deliver our products 
if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason  we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis 
if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner  our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline 
in a rising fuel cost environment  our freight costs will increase 
if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues  our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 
we are dependent on our international operations  which exposes us to foreign operational  political and other risks that may harm our business 
our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans  which are then transmitted electronically to juarez  mexico 
these digital files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
our order acquisition  aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez  mexico 
in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our santa clara  california facility  we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose  costa rica 
table of contents and moscow  russia 
in addition  our customer care  accounts receivable  credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica 
our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation  including difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally  as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political  social and economic instability  including as a result of increased levels of violence in juarez  mexico  acts of terrorism and acts of war  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  including as a result of health epidemics such as the outbreak of the hn virus in the event travel to and from mexico is restricted  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize in the future  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process 
if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand  the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 
training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately to days 
as a result  if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect 
any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers 
such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers 
this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our headquarters  digital dental modeling processes  and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose  costa rica 
the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software 
in addition  our customer facing operations are located in costa rica 
our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez  mexico 
both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located  our ability to create clincheck treatment plans  respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time 
in addition  our 
table of contents headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area 
an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations 
any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 
currently  our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary  and traditional braces manufactured by m s unitek and dentsply international 
these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may  in the future  attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive 
large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 
furthermore  we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies 
we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors  our business could be harmed 
increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions  reduced gross margins  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  volume growth  net profit losses and stock price 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our information technology systems are critical to our business 
system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems 
all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources 
as our business has grown in size and complexity  the growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our information technology systems 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems 
in addition  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
furthermore  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations  revenues and operating results 
we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications  such as customer facing and manufacturing tools  and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future 
system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources 
delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications  specifically clincheck and vip 
software applications frequently contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences  among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation or increased service costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents our success depends in part on our proprietary technology  and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products  both in the us and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and issued foreign patents  and pending foreign patent applications 
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
however  our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents 
additionally  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable  circumvented  or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition  any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws 
we also rely on protection of our copyrights  trade secrets  know how and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information  and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents  copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
in particular  a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology  which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 
in addition  in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation 
the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
see part i  item of this annual report on form k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we are required to furnish in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and  as a result  the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial 
table of contents reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering  technology development  sales and marketing personnel and management teams 
the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel  including orthodontists 
few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices  universities and other research institutions 
thus  we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business 
furthermore  we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim  our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry 
we have been sued for infringement of third party s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
from time to time  we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in which event  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies  and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 
we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment  rapid prototyping machines  resin and other advanced materials 
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies 
in particular  our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier 
we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer  the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process  from a single source 
in addition  technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive  time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes 
our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth 
in the event of technology changes  delivery delays  or shortages of or increases in price for these items  our business and growth prospects may be harmed 
we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products  and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets 
as of december   our north american sales organization consisted of people  of which were direct sales representatives and were sales administration 
internationally  
table of contents we had people engaged in sales and sales support as of december  we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business 
if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time  our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 
in addition  due to our large and fragmented customer base  we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product 
as a result  adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 
complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design  development  manufacturing and testing  product labeling  product storage  pre market clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies  which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  repair  replacement  refunds  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  new intended uses  or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or pre market approvals that have already been granted  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections 
our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action  and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers  which could be a long and costly process 
before we can sell a new medical device in the us  or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval  unless an exemption applies 
obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda  we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future 
our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

table of contents if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable for related damages  and our reputation could be impaired 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired 
in addition  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years  there have been and continue to be proposals by the obama administration  members of congress  state governments  regulators and third party payors to control these costs and  more generally  to reform the us healthcare system 
in december  the united states senate advanced legislation that included a market share based excise tax of approximately billion annually on medical device manufacturers beginning in this legislation compares to a bill previously passed by the house of representatives that includes a percent sales based excise tax on medical device manufacturers beginning in at this point in the legislative process  the differences between each version have not yet been reconciled 
we cannot predict whether legislation will be enacted  the final form any legislation might take or the effects of such legislation 
these taxes  if implemented  would result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry  which could have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 
furthermore  our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants 
the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 
in addition to medical device laws and regulations  numerous state and federal healthcare related laws regulate our business  covering areas such as storage  transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer  payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order  purchase or recommendation of our products  and the marketing and advertising of our products 
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming  and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

table of contents we face risks related to our international sales  including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 
we currently sell our products in europe  asia pacific  latin america and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time 
we do not know whether orthodontists  gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
in addition  sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval  and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future 
we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals 
if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us  or if we fail to receive these approvals  we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner  if at all 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable 
although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management s attention away from the operation of our business  and could harm our business 
historically  the market price for our common stock has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors  such as product announcements or acquisitions  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  and general economic market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
historically  class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
recently  a securities class action suit was filed against us on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock between january  and october  while we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves  we could incur substantial legal fees  and our management s attention and resources may be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

table of contents future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders 
these stockholders have sold in the past  and may sell in the future  large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for share based payments  and accounting for income taxes 
if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully  our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 
the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
to achieve this objective  a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value  and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  we will be required to write down the value of our investments  which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector 
with the current unstable credit environment  we might incur significant realized  unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 
we have adopted a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions 
table of contents relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
in june  the costa rica ministry of foreign trade  an agency of the government of costa rica  granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in under these incentives  all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax 
the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply  absent the incentives  is for because costa rica incurred a net loss in  no tax benefit was realized from these incentives in in order to receive the benefit of the incentives  we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica 
if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason  our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates  which could have a negative impact on our operating results

overview align technology  inc designs  manufactures and markets the invisalign system  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 
each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient 
our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals 
our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners 
invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or teen treatment market 
invisalign assist is intended to help newly trained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice 
upon completion of an invisalign or non invisalign treatment  the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product  or our vivera retainers  a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product innovation and clinical effectiveness  enhancing the customer experience  generating consumer demand and expanding into international markets 
each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i business business strategy of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by this reference 
in addition to whether we successfully execute our business strategy  a number of other factors  the most important of which are set forth below  may affect our results in and beyond 
proficiency requirements 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization 
we have a large number of low volume doctors that make up a large portion of our customer base 
we want every invisalign provider to be one we can comfortably direct a prospective patient to with an expectation of knowledgeable treatment and a great outcome 
on june   we announced the implementation of the invisalign product proficiency requirements or the proficiency requirements in north america to help ensure that invisalign trained doctors have the experience and confidence necessary to achieve high quality treatment outcomes for invisalign patients 
under the proficiency requirements  every invisalign provider in north america must have invisalign case starts measured by clincheck acceptance and complete at least invisalign specific continuing education ce credits each calendar year 
doctors who met the proficiency requirements of case starts and invisalign ce hours by the end of will benefit from a new addition to align s consumer marketing programs  one that encourages prospective patients to seek out invisalign preferred providers 
starting in january  this new invisalign preferred designation will be highlighted on the invisalign web site and in television ads as a way to recognize doctors commitment to continued proficiency with invisalign 
the invisalign preferred designation will then be awarded on an annual basis to doctors who meet the proficiency requirements for a given year 

table of contents in october  we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a one time  additional six month qualification period for doctors who were unable to meet the proficiency requirements for  but demonstrated a desire to continue using invisalign 
the additional six month qualification period stipulated that for those doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june   provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least case starts and invisalign ce hours between january and june  doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least case starts and invisalign ce hours by the end of to qualify as providers for the following year 
doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of were not eligible for the additional qualification period 
they will be able to continue treating in progress cases but will not be able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources 
doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign training and meeting the proficiency requirements 
as of january  approximately  doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another  doctors met the criteria for the additional six month qualification period in we limited the account status of approximately  doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements 
these doctors can continue treating and finishing in progress patients 
in addition  we deactivated approximately  invisalign trained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case 
although approximately  doctors met the criteria for the additional six month qualification period  the proficiency requirements may result in greater variability among customer activity  particularly in the second half of after the additional six month qualification period expires 
there can be no assurance on the number of doctors that ultimately meet the criteria for the additional six month qualification period 
if the number of our customers who fail to maintain and or increase utilization to meet the additional qualification requirements on june  is greater than expected  our case volumes in the second half of will decrease and our revenues will be harmed 
we want every doctor to achieve and maintain the proficiency requirements with invisalign  we expect  however  that a number of our lower volume doctors may choose not to meet these requirements 
in addition  if gps and orthos do not attend our training courses in sufficient numbers for any reason  including the introduction of the proficiency requirements  or declining general economic conditions  our revenue may fail to grow as expected 
number of new doctors trained 
prior to  we historically have trained at least  new dentists per year in north america 
with the introduction of the proficiency requirements and a renewed focus on attracting the right kind of customer  we trained approximately  new doctors in north america in our new doctor training in north america is evolving to identify and focus on practices that are interested in gaining the skills and experience necessary to be successful with invisalign 
in the past  many doctors completed this training course as a means of learning more about invisalign or leveraging the marketing benefits of invisalign  but then only sporadically submitted cases 
building on our experience with the proficiency requirements  going forward  we expect that doctors are more likely to attend our training course when they are actually ready to begin using invisalign in their practices right away 
as a result  over time  although we are likely to have a more focused  engaged and committed customer base that maintains a baseline of up to date invisalign product knowledge  we expect that the number of new doctors trained in north america will be relatively comparable to 
table of contents utilization rates 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals  or utilization 
our quarterly utilization rates from the years ended december    and are as follows logo utilization rates of cases shipped divided by of doctors cases were shipped to although utilization rates in the fourth quarter of for each of our ortho  gp  and international channels were higher than the same quarter last year  we expect to see fluctuation in our utilization rates as practices adjust to the proficiency requirements 
as a result of the proficiency requirements  we expect that in  we will ship cases to fewer doctors each quarter compared to prior years 
this will likely result in greater variability in utilization rates  particularly in the second half of after the additional qualification period expires 
due to this and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of utilization rates may not be as meaningful in impact of new products on deferred revenue 
many of our products launched in vivera retainers  invisalign teen  invisalign assist include features of staged delivery or the option to receive replacement aligners during the course of treatment 
as a result of these features  these products have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling prices compared to invisalign full 
vivera retainers are delivered in four shipments over the course of a year  and revenue is initially deferred and then recognized as each shipment occurs 
invisalign teen which includes up to six replacement aligners  is delivered in a single shipment except for the replacement aligners 
currently  the revenue for the six replacement aligners is percent deferred based on the fair market value and recognized as the replacement aligners are used or when the case is completed 
although invisalign teen has been available since july  we do not have sufficient evidence to support a usage rate less than percent for the six replacement aligners at this time  however  we are continually gathering and evaluating our historical experience 
if and when we gather sufficient historical experience to support a usage rate for the six replacement aligners less than percent  we would adjust our deferred revenue balance to the estimated usage rate and prospectively apply this rate to future invisalign teen shipments 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped every nine stages 
as a result  revenue for these cases is deferred upon the first shipment and will be recognized upon the final shipment 
depending on customers adoption of these products  our mix of products may continue to gradually shift towards these products  which will result in an increase in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 

table of contents impact on consumer spending due to continued weakness in general economic conditions 
consumer spending habits are affected by among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence  and consumer perception of economic conditions 
continued weakness in the united states economy and certain international economies in and into has adversely affected consumer spending habits 
as a result of the uncertain economic outlook for  our case volumes from quarter to quarter are difficult to predict with certainty  and our revenue may fail to grow as expected 
international expansion 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets  europe and japan 
with the availability of invisalign teen in march for invisalign trained doctors worldwide  we expect the addressable market for our product internationally to expand and ultimately increase adoption 
in addition  we will continue to focus on increasing brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign 
additionally  although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales  approximately of our international sales are through distributors covering smaller international markets  specifically asia pacific and latin america 
we recently announced the addition of an international distributor for smaller country markets in europe  the middle east and africa 
we will continue to consider selling through distributors in other smaller or less strategic markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case by case basis 
with these efforts  we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
in  our international sales increased from of net revenues to of net revenues 
seasonal fluctuations 
seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected  and are likely to continue to affect our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases  especially in europe 
in addition  summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients 
many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year 
as a result  adult appointments  including adult invisalign patient starts  are often pushed further into late summer or early fall 
in  we did not experience the normal seasonality in our business and had sequential case growth in the north american orthodontic from second quarter to the third quarter 
with the availability of invisalign teen  was the first summer we were able to actively compete for a share of teen patient starts and believe that invisalign teen may have helped moderate the historical downward trend we have typically seen for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months 
however  there can be no assurance that our historical seasonal trends will not continue to cause  fluctuations in our quarterly results  including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 
foreign exchange rates 
although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchanges rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
ormco litigation settlement 
on august   the company and ormco entered into a settlement agreement  pursuant to which the company paid ormco a cash amount equal to approximately million  and agreed to issue to danaher corporation danaher  an affiliate of ormco  million fully paid and non assessable shares of the company s common stock  million and million of which were issued to danaher on august  and september   respectively  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement entered into between the company and danaher on august  
table of contents joint development  marketing and sales agreement 
in connection with the settlement reached with ormco  on august   align and ormco entered into the joint development  marketing and sales agreement  pursuant to which the parties have agreed to an exclusive collaboration over the next seven years to jointly develop and commercialize a combination orthodontic treatment system involving the use of both align s clear aligner system and ormco s brackets and arch wire system  which system will be capable of treating even the most complex orthodontic cases 
see note ormco litigation settlement for additional information about the settlement accounting 
operating expenses 
during  we expect our research and development as well as selling and general administrative expenses to be higher as we continue to invest in our international operations  although we expect there will be quarterly fluctuations based on the timing of media spend  significant trade shows and industry events 
tax valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in assessing our need for a tax valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis  we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  however  should there be a change in our ability to recover these deferred tax assets  the tax provision would increase in the period in which it is more likely than not that the we cannot recover our deferred tax assets 
effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings

overall  north american invisalign revenues were comparable to and reflect a full year impact of product mix shifting from invisalign full towards invisalign teen and invisalign assist  both of which have higher amounts of deferred revenue than invisalign full 
additionally  north american revenues also include the full year impact of north american price increases that were effective in the beginning of the year 
the north american orthodontic channel experienced an increase in revenue and case volume primarily driven by the full year availability of invisalign teen 
north american gp revenues declined in compared to as a result of the product mix shift towards invisalign assist combined with an overall slightly lower case volume 
we believe that  as a result of the economic downturn and continued economic uncertainty  many gps focused their efforts on traditional dental procedures  and as a result  sales of invisalign to these customers were negatively impacted compared to depending on the customers adoption of these products  our product mix may continue to gradually shift towards these newer products that have higher deferred revenues 
our international invisalign revenues grew in compared to as a result of increased invisalign full case volumes and was supplemented by a partial year impact of invisalign teen  which was launched in march this increase was offset by unfavorable exchange rates 
total net revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of increased growth in our international invisalign revenue and our north american gp revenue 
net revenues from our north american invisalign orthodontic channel decreased in compared to due to decreased case volume and higher revenue deferrals related to new products introduced in partially offset by lower participation in volume based discount program rebates 
net revenues from our north american invisalign gp channel increased due to higher case volume and lower participation in volume based discount rebate programs 
the increase in our international invisalign revenues in compared to was predominately due to higher case volumes partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased participation in volume based discount programs 
other revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were lower in compared to primarily due to a decreased number of doctors trained year over year 
other revenues were lower in compared to due to north american training discount programs 
for  we expect our total net revenues to grow compared to primarily due to the expected increases in case volumes from both the north american and international invisalign channels 
quarterly revenues may be impacted by changes in product mix  the levels of promotional discounts  foreign exchange rates and other factors

gross margin improved in compared to primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure and improved operating efficiencies 
we believe that gross margin in will be higher than in due to an increase in revenue year over year as well as the cessation of the amortization of ormco prepaid royalties 
however  with our relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure  quarterly gross margin will fluctuate based on case volume and product mix 
additionally  the levels of promotional discounts  foreign exchange rates and several other factors can impact average selling prices  revenues  and gross margins

we are not obligated to affect any such registration prior to august  the fair value of the unregistered shares was determined as of the market closing price on the dates the shares were issued less a non marketability discount  for a total value of million  including the cash payment 
the determination of the discount applied to the restricted stock is highly subjective and is based primarily on an analysis utilizing the black scholes model to value a hypothetical put option to approximate the cost of hedging the restricted stock over the expected period of non marketability 
the table below provides for a sensitivity analysis if the discount rates were and higher or lower in thousands  except percentages 
total fair value of stock and cash consideration variance variance the value attributed to past infringement claims was recorded as litigation settlement costs and was based on case shipments from september  through august   totaling million  which was recorded in operating expenses and million was amortized to cost of sales for the year ended december  the remaining million will be amortized based on case shipments during first quarter of see note ormco litigation settlement for additional information about the settlement accounting

in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program 
subsequently  in the first quarter of  we reduced our patients first program accrual by million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline

interest rates for investments throughout the marketplace were lower due to the low federal funds rate established by the federal reserve during other expense  net  decreased in compared to reflecting increases in foreign exchange gains during interest income  net in decreased by million compared to primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the million stock repurchase program and lower interest rates 
in  we shifted our investments into more conservative instruments principally  us government securities  which bear lower interest rates 
we incurred no interest expense in compared to in we incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of our line of credit during which was repaid during we had no outstanding borrowings as of december  and december  provision for benefit from income taxes in millions years ended december  change change provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded income tax benefits of million and million for and  respectively and an income tax provision of million for these represented effective tax rates of   and  in  and  respectively 
our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
at december   based on an evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence  we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
in making that determination  we considered the historical and projected pretax operating profit  excluding stock based 
table of contents compensation  as well as the cyclical nature of our business and the uncertainty as to the impact of new product launches 
specifically  at december   the company considered the following positive evidence cumulative seven quarters of pretax operating profitability plus permanent items the then projected pretax book income for and beyond suggesting that deferred tax assets will be utilized the company also considered the following negative evidence history of operating losses in and prior to cyclical nature of the business and price volatility we believe that the positive evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence and as a result  we released our tax valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million is related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets 
these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
in february  the california budget legislation was signed into law 
one of the major components of this legislation is the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january  as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor  we are required to re measure our deferred taxes taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor 
we have determined that by electing a single sales factor apportionment  our deferred tax assets will decrease by approximately million net of federal benefit 
the tax impact of million has been recorded as a discrete item in the first quarter of at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal purposes and for california purposes 
the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes 
if an ownership change is determined to have occurred  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation 
however  based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december  and our current estimate of the annual limitation  we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification asc prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled million as of december  and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital  if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from product sales  the proceeds of the sale of our common stock  and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility 
as of december   and  we had the following cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments in thousands years ended december  cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net loss of million adjusted for non cash items including the litigation settlement with ormco of million and other non cash expenses totaling million  which included depreciation  amortization of intangibles  and stock based compensation expense 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was driven primarily by higher sales volume which also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of million due to increased sales of newer products that have higher deferred revenues 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net profit of million and non cash items totaling million  which included depreciation  amortization of intangibles  option acceleration charges for terminated executives and stock based compensation expense 
also included in non cash items was an asset impairment charge of million relating to management s decision to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management 
these increases were offset by the release of a non cash tax valuation allowance of million on most of the deferred tax assets 
cash flows from operating activities also resulted from a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in inventories 
these increases in cash flows were offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net income of million and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and amortization of intangibles totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  the primary driver was million used for the purchase of property and equipment in compared million in offset by million of net maturities from marketable securities as compared to million in although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired

net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which largely consisted of million of net purchases of short term marketable securities and million used for the purchase of capital assets 
net cash provided in financing activities was million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock 
these proceeds were partially offset from the tax benefit excess of shared based payments and taxes paid on vesting restricted stock units of million 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and resulted primarily from our million stock repurchase including commissions offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options 
this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options and million in net borrowings from our line of credit 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf 
during   and  we paid million  million  and million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers  respectively 
on december   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
under this revolving line of credit  we have million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december  this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and we were in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million including commissions 
as of december   we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization 
there were no stock repurchases in contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations on january   we entered into an agreement for new corporate headquarters to lease approximately  square feet in san jose  california 
the lease agreement commences on the earlier of august  or the date we first commence conducting business in the premises  which is expected to be on or about june  and will continue for an initial term of seven years and two months 
the lease agreement for our current office headquarters in santa clara  california  expires on june  see note subsequent event 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate 
table of contents operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
revenues are recognized from product sales  net of discounts and rebates 
service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment processes are recorded when the services are completed 
we enter into arrangements that involve multiple future deliverables 
included in the price of invisalign full  invisalign teen and invisalign assist  we offer case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment 
we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor  which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement usage 
actual usage rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 
revenues are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery 
depending on the product  revenues are recognized based on usage  case completion  ratably over a delivery period  or upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
invisalign teen  which includes up to six replacement aligners  is delivered in a single shipment except for the replacement aligners 
currently  the revenue for invisalign teen is recognized upon shipment except for the six replacement aligners for which the fair market value is percent deferred and recognized as the replacement aligners are shipped or when the case is completed 
although invisalign teen has been available since july  we do not have sufficient evidence to support a usage rate less than percent for the six replacement aligners at this time  however  we are continually gathering and evaluating our historical experience 
if and when we gather sufficient historical experience to support a usage rate for the six replacement aligners less than percent  we would adjust our deferred revenue balance to the estimated usage rate and prospectively apply this rate to future invisalign teen shipments 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized ratably over the one year delivery period 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
for these cases  revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 

table of contents we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives  unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 
deferred tax valuation allowance we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as of december   we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are in fixed rate  short term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica and japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 
prior to january   the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar  and accordingly  gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros  costa rican colones  and other currencies were reflected in other income expense 
during the first quarter of  we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency 
effective january   the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the stockholder s equity section of our consolidated balance sheets
