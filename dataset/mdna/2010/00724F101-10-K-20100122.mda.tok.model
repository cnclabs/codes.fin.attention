we have operations in the americas  europe  emea and asia 
our software runs on personal computers with microsoft windows  apple os  linux  unix and various non pc platforms  depending on the product 
acquisition of omniture on october   we completed the acquisition of omniture  an industry leader in web analytics and online business optimization based in orem  utah  for approximately billion 
accordingly  we have included the results of the business operations acquired from omniture in our consolidated results of operations beginning on october  we expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect our revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future  but we also anticipate both revenue and cost saving synergies 
coinciding with the integration of omniture  we created a new reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  business combinations  goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in addition  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product 
when evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories 
changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
we recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions  including implementation and set up fees  ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term 
over usage fees  and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data  are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our consulting revenue is primarily recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
accordingly  our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 

table of contents we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations assumed 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors 
table of contents and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there was no impairment 
we currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including a current examination by the irs for our fiscal  and tax returns 
these examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations overview of effective in the first quarter of fiscal  our former mobile and devices solutions segment  which was integrated into our platform business unit to better align our engineering and marketing efforts  is now reported as part of the platform segment 
prior year information has been updated to reflect the integration of these business units 
during fiscal  our business was broadly impacted by the global economic recession and generally weak macro economic environment 
this resulted in a significant year over year decline in our revenue and earnings results 
in our creative solutions segment  revenue decreased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute this decline to reduced adoption of our cs family of products during the year  as the global financial crisis significantly affected demand in the creative professional end user market 
all major creative product categories declined on a year over year basis 
our business productivity solutions business declined in fiscal when compared to fiscal a decline in demand primarily due to the macro economic environment with our acrobat product family which makes up the majority of revenue in our knowledge worker segment was the primary factor for this decline 
in our enterprise business  our livecycle revenue declined when compared to revenue achieved in fiscal we attribute this smaller percentage decline in comparison to our other segments to focused execution by our sales teams and the large market opportunities these product solutions address 

table of contents in our platform segment  revenue declined on a year over year basis primarily due to the impact of the osp 
the removal of license fees associated with our flash technologies on mobile devices commenced in fiscal  and as such  oem revenue from device manufacturers began to decline from rates of revenue we achieved in fiscal we continue to expect this decline to be offset over time by an increased demand for tooling products  server technologies  services and applications in many of our other business segments 
in our print and publishing segment  revenue was also impacted by the global macroeconomic environment  resulting in a year over year decline 
the omniture business appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter with the improvement in the general economy  as indicated by an increase in the transaction volume on our network 
in addition  customer retention rates began stabilizing and we experienced an increase in the number of subscription services provided to our existing customers 
revenue dollars in millions fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product percentage of total revenue services and support percentage of total revenue total revenue in fiscal  we categorized our products into the following segments creative solutions  knowledge worker  enterprise  platform  print and publishing and omniture products

table of contents acquisition of omniture on october   we completed the acquisition of omniture  an industry leader in web analytics and online business optimization based in orem  utah for approximately billion 
under the terms of the agreement  we completed our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of omniture common stock at a price of per share  net to the seller in cash  without interest 
we expect to incur significant incremental costs  such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays 
restructuring on november   we initiated a restructuring plan to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal operating plan impacting up to approximately full time positions worldwide 
in connection with this restructuring plan  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately of these full time positions worldwide 
as of november   approximately million was paid 
the remaining accrual associated with these ongoing termination benefits is expected to be paid during fiscal the restructuring activities related to this program are only to those employees and facilities that were associated with adobe prior to the acquisition of omniture on october  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to record approximately million to million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and up to approximately million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of the remaining full time positions worldwide 
we expect to accrue the facility related liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and pay these liabilities through fiscal based on current lease terms 
substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures 
we completed our acquisition of omniture on october  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a plan to restructure the pre merger operations of omniture to eliminate certain duplicative activities  focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we accrued a total of approximately million in costs related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately regular positions and for the closure of duplicative facilities 
we also accrued approximately million in costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by omniture 
these costs were recorded as a part of the purchase price allocation  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and have been accrued for as of november  we expect to pay the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  approximately million of restructuring costs related to facilities were included in the liabilities assumed by us upon acquisition of omniture on october  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program  consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately full time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities  in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities 
in connection with this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal totaling million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately of the full time positions globally 
during fiscal  we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program 
we vacated approximately  square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the us  the united kingdom and canada 
we accrued million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate  estimated at approximately as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties 
this amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately million 
we also recorded charges of million for ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining full time positions expected to be terminated 
we have paid substantially all of the accrued termination benefits during fiscal with and expect to pay the remaining amounts in fiscal we expect to pay facilities related liabilities through fiscal we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring changes described above 

table of contents other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may further decline during fiscal in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to the acquisition 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
at november   our existing credit facility is billion and we have borrowed against the entire amount 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our credit agreement 
we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash

outside of the us  our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury securities 
stock repurchase program i to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
during fiscal  and we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of million  million and billion  respectively 
we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over a specified period of time 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval  and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price per share of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal during fiscal  we also repurchased million shares at an average price of in open market transactions 
for fiscal  and  the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by november   november  and november  were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  in millions payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations debt total as of november   the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was billion which is due in full no later than february  interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation 
our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio 
our leases for the east and west towers and the almaden tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
as of november   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists 

table of contents the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that before the end of fiscal  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits equal to to approximately million 
these amounts would decrease income tax expense under accounting for income taxes and as a result of the revised accounting guidance for business combinations in fiscal see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the revised accounting guidance for business combinations  adjustments to acquired income tax liabilities including adjustments for acquisitions completed prior to the effective date that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in income from continuing operations  with certain exceptions  if such changes occur after the measurement period 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
these liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to our consolidated statements of income over the life of the leases 
as of november   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director s or officer s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency risk foreign currency hedging instruments in countries outside the us  we transact business  in us dollars and in various other currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro and yen  respectively  are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for euro or yen denominated revenue 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euros  million euros and million euros  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
our european operating expenses are primarily in euro and our japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to euro and yen denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
as of november   total outstanding contracts were million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of november   all contracts were set to expire at various times through july the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition  we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of november  and november   this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and the japanese yen 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net on our consolidated statements of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with 
table of contents changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income  net 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
interest rate risk short term investments and fixed income securities at november   we had debt securities classified as short term investments of million 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments 
the following table separates these investments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates in millions due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes

table of contents other market risk privately held long term investments the privately held companies in which we invest  can still be considered in the start up or development stages which are inherently risky 
the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 
see note and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our limited partnership interest in adobe ventures 
short term investments and marketable equity securities we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities
