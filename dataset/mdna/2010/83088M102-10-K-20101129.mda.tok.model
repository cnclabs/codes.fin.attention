table of contents results of operations years ended october   october   and october  the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years below net revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and other charges credits total operating expenses operating income interest expense loss on early retirement of convertible debt other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income general during fiscal year  certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations 
more specifically according to some industry estimates  sales of smart phones and mobile internet devices are growing four times faster than traditional cellular handsets given consumer s appetite for anytime  anywhere connectivity 
we believe that this is the driving force behind the higher overall demand for our wireless semiconductor products that support mobile internet  wireless infrastructure  energy management and diversified analog applications 
the increase in the overall market coupled with an increase in our market share are the primary drivers of the approximately or million year over year revenue growth 
gross profit increased by million or basis points to of net revenue for the fiscal year ending october  as compared to fiscal year the increase in gross profit in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenue is primarily the result of continued factory process and productivity enhancements  product end to end yield improvements  year over year material cost reductions  targeted capital expenditure investments  and the aforementioned increase in net revenues 
operating income increased by million or over the prior year to of revenue for fiscal year the increase is primarily due to the aforementioned increases in net revenue and gross margin along with a higher degree of operating leverage as the company maintained relatively constant operating expenditures 
we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal year resulting in a cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of million at october  in fiscal year  we retired million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 
these retirements reduced the remaining aggregate outstanding principal balance on our convertible notes to million carrying value of million resulting in a net cash position of million at october  
table of contents net revenues fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change net revenues we market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers oems of communication electronic products  third party original design manufacturers odms  contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we periodically enter into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our non core patents or other intellectual property 
we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenues in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year this revenue increase was principally driven by market share gains and higher overall demand for our products used in mobile internet  wireless infrastructure  energy management and diversified analog applications 
overall revenues in fiscal year decreased by million  or  from fiscal year this revenue decline was principally due to a reduction in demand in our end markets as a result of adverse global macroeconomic conditions  in addition to our exit from certain product areas such as mobile transceivers in the second fiscal quarter of for information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
gross profit fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change gross profit of net revenues gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and equity based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
we increased our gross profit by million for the fiscal year ending october  as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a basis point expansion in gross profit margin to 
this was principally the result of continued factory process and productivity enhancements  product end to end yield improvements  year over year material cost reductions  targeted capital expenditure investments and the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
during fiscal we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
we maintained relatively consistent gross profit margins of for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year despite a year over year decrease in the overall revenue base between the two fiscal years 
this was principally the result of aggressive year over year material cost reductions  yield improvements  leverage of our fixed costs and cost control measures including capacity management enhanced by the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model 
gross profit in aggregate dollars decreased by million between fiscal year and fiscal year primarily as the result of the aforementioned million decrease in overall revenues 
in fiscal year  we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 

table of contents research and development fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change research and development of net revenues research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  masks and engineering prototypes  equity based compensation expense and design and test tool costs 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to higher head count and related compensation costs 
in addition  the company had ramped design activity resulting in higher mask  prototype and materials costs in support of increased product development for our target markets 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year as a result of the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
the decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year was principally attributable to the restructuring plan implemented on january  in which we exited non core product areas 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change selling  general and administrative of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  bad debt expense  sales commissions  share based compensation expense  advertising  marketing and other costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is principally due to share based compensation which increased primarily as a result of our increased stock price in fiscal year as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the aforementioned increase in fiscal year revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  mainly due to the aforementioned decline in fiscal year revenue 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change amortization of net revenues amortization expense remained consistent during the fiscal years presented above

restructuring and other charges fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change restructuring and other charges of net revenues restructuring and other charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities 
on january   we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our costs given the business conditions at the time 
we exited our mobile transceiver product area and reduced global headcount by approximately  or employees which resulted in a reduction to annual operating expenditures of approximately million 
we recorded various charges associated with this action 
in total  we recorded million of restructuring and other charges and million in inventory write downs that were charged to cost of goods sold 
during fiscal year we recorded a gain of million on the sale of a capital asset previously impaired during the restructuring 
for additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
interest expense fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change interest expense of net revenues interest expense is comprised principally of interest expense related to the company s convertible notes which has been calculated under asc debt  debt with conversion and other options 
interest expense includes charges in connection with our million credit facility between skyworks usa  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and wells fargo bank  na our ability to borrow under the credit facility expired in october and  given our strong cash position  management has determined that the credit facility was no longer required and accordingly  has been substantially repaid as of november  the decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to the decline in interest payments and amortization of discount associated with the early retirement and settlement of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 

table of contents the decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the early retirement of million in aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible notes in fiscal year for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
loss gain on early retirement of convertible debt fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change loss gain on early retirement of convertible debt of net revenues we retired million and million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due in and  respectively  during the fiscal year 
we recorded a net loss of million during fiscal year related to the early retirement of these notes 
we retired million and million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes and recorded a net gain of million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
for additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements  see note of item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents other loss income  net fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change other loss income  net of net revenues other income  net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances  other non operating income and expense items and foreign exchange gains losses 
the decreases in other income in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year related to an overall decline in interest income on invested cash balances due to lower rates combined with a net loss on foreign currency translation 
for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year  the overall decline in interest income on invested cash balances is due to lower interest rates in fiscal year provision benefit for income taxes fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands change change provision benefit for income taxes of net revenues the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended october  was million as compared to a benefit of million in fiscal year the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to a tax benefit of for fiscal year the income tax provision for fiscal year consisted of million  million and million for united states tax expense  reserves for tax uncertainties  and foreign tax expense  respectively 
the fiscal year benefit of million was primarily due to a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the utilization and recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating loss and credit carry forwards and other items  and united states income tax benefit of million  offset by increases to reserves for tax uncertainties of million and foreign tax expense of million 
the income tax benefit was million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
the fiscal year benefit of million is due to a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits from united states federal and state net operating loss and credit carry forwards  offset by united states income tax expense of million  a charge in lieu of tax expense of million  and foreign tax benefit of million 
the fiscal year charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of acquisition  the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we have determined it is more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized 
accordingly  as of october   we have maintained a valuation allowance of million of which million relates to our united states deferred tax assets principally related to state research tax credits  and million relates to our foreign operations 
if these benefits are recognized in a future period the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be reversed and up to a million income tax benefit  and up to a million reduction to goodwill may be recognized 
our balance of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  as of october  is million 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating taxable income in the future 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the outcome of that assessment  additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense 
such adjustments could cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods 
we will need to 
table of contents generate million of future united states federal taxable income to utilize our united states deferred tax assets as of october  no provision has been made for united states  state  or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings  were not permanently reinvested 
our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits at october   million would lower the effective tax rate  if recognized 
the remaining unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate  if recognized  due to our valuation allowance and certain positions which were required to be capitalized 
there are no positions which we anticipate could change materially within the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended october  october  october  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period does not include restricted cash balances cash flow from operating activities cash provided from operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 
for fiscal year we generated million in cash flow from operations  an increase of million when compared to the million generated in fiscal year during fiscal year  net income increased by million to million when compared to fiscal year despite the increase in net income  net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively consistent 
this was primarily due to fiscal year net income included a deferred tax expense of million compared to a million deferred tax benefit included in net income due to the release of the tax valuation allowance in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company invested in working capital as result of higher business activity 
compared to fiscal year  accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable increased by million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from investing activities cash flow from investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we had net cash outflows of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase is primarily due to an increase of million in capital expenditures 
we anticipate our capital spending to be consistent in fiscal year to maintain our projected growth rate 
cash flow from financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash transactions related to debt and equity 
during fiscal year  we had net cash outflows of million  compared to million in fiscal year during the year we had the following significant transactions 
table of contents we retired million in aggregate principal amount carrying value of million of convertible notes for million  which included a million premium paid for the equity component of the instrument 
we received net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year liquidity cash and cash equivalent balances increased million to million at october  from million at october  our net cash position  after deducting our short and long term debt  increased by million to million at october  from million at october  based on our historical results of operations  we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make may require additional capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 
our invested cash balances primarily consist of money market funds and repurchase agreements where the underlying securities primarily consist of united states treasury obligations  united states agency obligations  overnight repurchase agreements backed by united states treasuries and or united states agency obligations and highly rated commercial paper 
our invested cash balances also include time deposits and certificates of deposit 
at october   we also held a million par value auction rate security 
disruptions in the credit markets have impaired the value of this security 
during the fiscal year ended october   we concluded the fair value of the auction rate security was million  and the carrying value was reduced by million 
in the fiscal year ended october   we recorded temporary unrealized losses of approximately million in other comprehensive income and the auction rate security balance was reclassified to non current other assets 
we continue to monitor the liquidity and accounting classification of this security 
if in a future period we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we will impair the security to its fair value and charge the loss to earnings 
on july   we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to skyworks usa  inc  a wholly owned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes 
concurrently  skyworks usa entered into the credit facility 
any interest incurred by skyworks usa related to monies it borrows under the credit facility is recorded as interest expense in the company s consolidated results of operations 
interest related to the credit facility is at libor plus 
as of october   skyworks usa had borrowed million under this agreement 
our ability to borrow under the credit facility expired in october and  given our strong cash position  management has determined that the credit facility was no longer required and accordingly  has been substantially repaid as of november  off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulation s k a ii 
contractual cash flows following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for consolidated debt  purchase agreements  operating leases  other commitments and long term liabilities at october  see notes and of item of this annual report on form k  in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period less than obligation total year years years thereafter short term debt obligations long term debt obligations other commitments operating lease obligations other long term liabilities short term debt obligation represents the cancellation and repayment of the credit facility which will occur during the first quarter of fiscal year other commitments consist of contractual license and royalty payments  and other purchase obligations 
other long term liabilities includes our gross unrecognized tax benefits  as well as executive deferred compensation which are both classified as beyond five years due to the uncertain nature of the commitment 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  share based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles  and income taxes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported  disclosures  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in item in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition net of estimated reserves 
we maintain revenue reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection stock rotation for certain electronic component distributors 
these reserves are based on historical experience or specific identification of a contractual arrangement necessitating a revenue reserve 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for product returns  price protection and stock rotation 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to record revenue reserves during the last three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to earnings 

table of contents effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts that we estimate will arise from customers inability to make required payments against amounts owed on credit sales 
the reserve is based on the analysis of credit risk and aged receivable balances 
our allowance for doubtful accounts methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to apply judgment to evaluate credit risk and collectability of aged accounts receivables based on historical experience and forward looking assumptions 
during fiscal year we modified the process in which we evaluate customers creditworthiness when establishing our allowance 
this did not have a material effect in our balance 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to earnings 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
our reserve is based on a detailed analysis of forecasted demand in relation to on hand inventory  salability of our inventory  general market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventory reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we have not made any material changes to our inventory reserve methodology during the last three fiscal years 
we do not believe that significant changes will be made in future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these reserves 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate or changes in technology affect consumer demand we may be exposed to unforeseen gains or losses 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of october  would affect fiscal year earnings by approximately million 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan which includes non qualified stock options  share awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
see note of item for a detailed listing and complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock based compensation at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant contains assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  risk free rate  the expected life and potential forfeitures of awards 
management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates stock based compensation expense accordingly 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and stock based compensation recognized by the company 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to calculate stock based compensation during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to a material change in stock based compensation expense 
a difference in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended october  would affect fiscal year earnings by approximately million 

table of contents effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions valuation of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the assets to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group  we would recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate asset fair values  including estimating future cash flows  useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may incur material losses 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods and disclosure 
the application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations  and court rulings 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we feel is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits of the position  to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we feel are more likely than not to not be realized 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities or reserves for additional income tax liabilities 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  or events caused us to change our estimate of probable additional income tax liability  a further charge to expense would be required 
the company expects to continue to be profitable and therefore has determined that a valuation allowance is not required against our deferred tax assets  except for certain state and foreign tax credits 
if certain events caused us to change our estimate of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  a further charge to expense would be required 

table of contents effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangibles may not be recoverable 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise an insignificant portion of the total book value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
pursuant to the guidance provide under asc segment reporting  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating and testing goodwill 
the impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we use the market price of the company s stock adjusted for a market premium to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the possible goodwill impairment loss 
in the second step  we would use a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would then be compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we would recognize a loss equal to the excess 
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate control premiums  discount rate  future cash flows and the profitability of future business strategies 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at october  were million and million  respectively 
based on the results of our impairment test  we had a significant excess fair value over the carrying value 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to investment risk  interest rate risk  and foreign exchange rate risk as described below 

table of contents investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio  which as of october  consisted of the following in thousands cash and cash equivalents time deposits  overnight repurchase agreements and money market funds restricted cash time deposits and certificates of deposit available for sale securities auction rate securities the main objective of our investment activities is the liquidity and preservation of capital 
in general  our cash and cash equivalent investments have short term maturity periods which dampen the impact of significant market or interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with our investments is not material as our investment policy prescribes high credit quality standards and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading  speculative or investment purposes  however  we may use derivatives in the future 
we are subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality and interest rates 
available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period contractual maturities exceed ten years 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility of million 
interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility is at a variable rate of libor plus and was approximately at october  our ability to borrow under the credit facility expired in october and  given our strong cash position  management has determined that the credit facility was no longer required and accordingly  has been substantially repaid as of november  our long term debt at october  consists of million aggregate principal amount our convertible notes 
the convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions  which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the company s common stock exceed 
it has been the company s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments  and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future 
these shares have been included in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended october  we do not believe that investment of interest rate risk is material to our business or results of operations 
exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended october   october   and october   the company had foreign exchange gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
