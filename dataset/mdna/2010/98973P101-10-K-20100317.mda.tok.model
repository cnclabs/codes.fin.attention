the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements which are included in item of part ii of this form k 
business overview ziopharm oncology  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to develop and commercialize a diverse  risk sensitive portfolio of in licensed cancer drugs that can address unmet medical needs through enhanced efficacy and or safety and quality of life 
our principal focus is on the licensing and development of proprietary small molecule drug candidates that are related to cancer therapeutics already on the market or in development and that can be administered by intravenous and or oral capsule dosing 
we believe this strategy will result in lower risk and expedited drug development programs with product candidates having a low cost of manufacturing to address changing reimbursement requirements around the world 
while we may endeavor to commercialize our products on our own in north america  we recognize that favorable clinical trial results can be better addressed by partnering with companies with the requisite financial resources 
with partnering  we could also negotiate the right to complete development and marketing in certain geographies  especially for certain limited niche indications 
although we are currently in phase i and or ii studies for three product candidates identified as darinaparsin zinapar tm  zio  palifosfamide zymafos tm  zio  and indibulin zybulin tm  zio  our current focus has been and remains on palifosfamide development and more specifically on completing the ongoing randomized phase ii trial with palifosfamide to support a registration trial for palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin in the front and second line setting of soft tissue sarcoma 
we anticipate the initiation of such a registration trial as early as the first half of zio or darinaparsin zinapar tm is an anti mitochondrial organic arsenic compound covered by issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in foreign countries 
a form of commercially available inorganic arsenic arsenic trioxide 
trisenox 
or ato has been approved in the united states and the european union and japan for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia  a precancerous condition 
in the united states  ato is on the compendia listing for the therapy of multiple myeloma  and has been studied for the treatment of various other cancers 
nevertheless  ato has been shown to be toxic to the heart  liver  and brain  which limits its use as an anti cancer agent 
ato carries a black box warning for ecg abnormalities since arsenic trioxide has been shown to cause qt interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block 
qt prolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes type ventricular arrhythmia  which can be fatal 
inorganic arsenic has also been shown to cause cancer of the skin and lung in humans 
the toxicity of arsenic 
table of contents is generally correlated to its accumulation in organs and tissues 
our preclinical and clinical studies to date have demonstrated that darinaparsin is considerably less toxic than ato  particularly with regard to cardiac toxicity 
in vitro testing of darinaparsin using the national cancer institute s human cancer cell panel demonstrated activity against a series of tumor cell lines including lung  colon  brain  melanoma  ovarian  and kidney cancer 
moderate activity was shown against breast and prostate cancer tumor cell lines 
in addition to solid tumors  in vitro testing in both the national cancer institute s cancer cell panel and in vivo testing in a leukemia animal model demonstrated substantial activity against hematological cancers cancers of the blood and blood forming tissues such as leukemia  lymphoma  myelodysplastic syndromes  and multiple myeloma 
results indicate significant activity against the hut cutaneous t cell lymphoma  the nk gmi natural killer cell nhl  karpas t cell nhl  su dhl b cell nhl  su dhl b cell nhl and su dhl b cell nhl cell lines 
preclinical studies have also established anti angiogenic properties of darinaparsin and provided support for the development of an oral capsule form of the drug  and established synergy of darinaparsin in combination with other approved anti cancer agents 
phase i testing of the intravenous iv form of darinaparsin in solid tumors and hematological cancers has been completed 
we reported clinical activity and  importantly  a safety profile from these studies as predicted by preclinical results 
we subsequently completed phase ii studies in advanced myeloma and primary liver cancer and are nearing completion of a phase ii study in certain other hematological cancers 
in addition  we are completing two phase i studies with an oral capsule form of darinaparsin 
at the may annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology  we reported favorable results from the trial with iv administered darinaparsin in lymphoma  particularly peripheral t cell lymphoma 
in the ongoing phase i trials  also reported at the asco annual meeting  preliminary data primarily in solid tumors indicate the oral form is active and well tolerated 
we are completing data collection from the iv phase ii trial to address a registration and other trials with the us food and drug administration 
the oral phase i program will be progressed to establish a dose for further clinical testing 
zio or palifosfamide zymafos tm  comprises the active metabolite of ifosfamide  a compound chemically related to cyclophosphamide 
patent applications covering proprietary forms of palifosfamide for pharmaceutical composition and method of use have been filed in the us and internationally and in the us we recently received a notice of patent allowance 
like cyclophosphamide  ifosfamide and bendamustine  palifosfamide is a dna alkylating agent  a form of cancer therapy to treat a wide range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
we believe that cyclophosphamide is the most widely used alkylating agent in cancer therapy  with significant use in the treatment of breast cancer and non hodgkin s lymphoma 
bendamustine has been recently approved and successfully launched by cephalon in the us and europe to treat certain hematological malignancies 
ifosfamide has been shown to be effective in the treatment of sarcoma and lymphoma  either by itself or in combination with other anticancer agents 
ifosfamide is approved by the fda as a treatment for testicular cancer while ifosfamide based treatment is a standard of care for sarcoma  although it is not licensed for this indication by the fda 
preclinical studies have shown that palifosfamide has activity against leukemia and solid tumors 
these studies also indicate that palifosfamide may have a better safety profile than ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide because it does not appear to produce known toxic metabolites of ifosfamide  such as acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde 
acrolein  which is toxic to the kidneys and bladder  can mandate the administration of a protective agent called mesna  which is inconvenient and expensive 
chloroacetaldehyde is toxic to the central nervous system  causing fuzzy brain syndrome for which there is currently no protective measure 
similar toxicity concerns pertain to high dose cyclophosphamide  which is widely used in bone marrow and blood cell transplantation 
palifosfamide has evidenced activity against ifosfamide and or cyclophosphamide resistant cancer cell lines 
also in preclinical cancer models  palifosfamide was shown to be orally active and encouraging results have been obtained with palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin  an agent approved to treat sarcoma 

table of contents following completion of phase i study  we completed phase ii testing of the intravenous form of palifosfamide as a single agent to treat advanced sarcoma 
in both phase i and phase ii testing  palifosfamide has been administered without the uroprotectant mesna  and the toxicities associated with acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde have not been observed 
we reported clinical activity of palifosfamide when used alone in the phase ii study addressing advanced sarcoma 
following review of preclinical combination studies  clinical data  and discussion with sarcoma experts  we initiated a phase i dose escalation study of palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin primarily in patients with soft tissue sarcoma 
we reported favorable results and safety profile from this study at asco s annual meeting 
in light of reported favorable phase ii clinical activity data and with the combination of palifosfamide with doxorubicin well tolerated in the phase i trial and evidencing activity  we initiated a phase ii randomized controlled trial in the second half of to compare doxorubicin plus palifosfamide to doxorubicin alone in patients with front and second line metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma 
the study has generated positive top line interim data in upon reaching a pre specified efficacy milestone and following safety and efficacy data review by the data committee  sarcoma experts  and our medical advisory board  we elected to suspend enrollment in the trial in october we subsequently presented further positive interim data from the trial at the th annual connective tissue oncology society meeting held in november we currently plan to initiate a registration trial following regulatory review of the palifosfamide program to date 
we are also developing an oral capsule form of palifosfamide to be studied clinically following receipt of further data from the iv trials and subject to obtaining sufficient additional sources of funding  either from potential partnering arrangements or from other sources 
to date we have no such partnering arrangements or other sources of such financing in place 
we are also considering additional phase ii trials in other solid tumors as funding becomes available 
orphan drug designation for palifosfamide has been obtained in both the united states and the european union for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas 
zio or indibulin zybulin tm  is a novel  orally available small molecular weight inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that we acquired from baxter healthcare in and is the subject of numerous patents worldwide  including the united states  the european union and japan 
the microtubule component  tubulin  is one of the more well established drug targets in cancer 
microtubule inhibitors interfere with the dynamics of tubulin polymerization  resulting in inhibition of chromosome segregation during mitosis and consequently inhibition of cell division 
a number of marketed iv anticancer drugs target tubulin  such as the taxane family members  paclitaxel taxol  docetaxel taxotere  the vinca alkaloid family members  vincristine and vinorelbine  and the new class of epothilones with ixempra tm marketed 
this class of agents is typically the mainstay of therapy in a wide variety of indications 
in spite of their effectiveness  the use of these drugs is associated with significant toxicities  notably peripheral neurotoxicity 
preclinical studies with indibulin demonstrate significant and broad antitumor activity  including activity against taxane refractory cell lines 
the cytotoxic activity of indibulin was demonstrated in several rodent and human tumor cell lines derived from prostate  brain  breast  pancreas  lung  ovary  and cervical tumor tissues and in rodent tumor and human tumor xenograft models 
in addition  indibulin was effective against multidrug resistant tumor cell lines breast  lung  and leukemia both in vitro and in vivo 
indibulin is potentially safer than other tubulin inhibitors 
no neurotoxicity has been observed at therapeutic doses in rodents and in the phase i trials 
indibulin has also demonstrated synergy with approved anti cancer agents in preclinical studies 
the availability of an oral capsule formulation of indibulin creates significant commercial opportunity because no oral capsule formulations of the taxane family are currently on the market in the united states 
indibulin  as a single agent  has completed phase i trials in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we have reported clinical activity at well tolerated doses using a continuous dosing scheme without the development of clinically relevant peripheral neuropathy 
following encouraging results obtained with indibulin in combination with erlotinib  and fu in preclinical models  two phase i combination studies were initiated with tarceva tm and xeloda tm  respectively 
favorable activity and safety profile of oral indibulin with oral xeloda tm were reported at asco s annual meeting in may 
table of contents preclinical work with our consultant  dr 
larry norton  to explore dose scheduling for the clinical setting have been completed  with results supporting the our current plan to initiate the phase i portion of a phase i ii breast cancer trial using a mathematical dose schedule frequency established preclinically 
subject to the sufficiency of our financial resources  we intend to continue with clinical development of iv palifosfamide for soft tissue sarcoma in a registration trial and  with additional funding  to initiate a clinical study with the oral form following fda approval and or additional indications beyond sts  with iv darinaparsin  to obtain additional funding for ptcl registration and other trials and with the further development of the oral form  and with oral indibulin  to complete the phase i breast cancer trial and subsequently  with additional funding  other trials 
however  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate  are difficult to accurately predict  and will require us to obtain additional funding  either alone or in connection with partnering arrangements 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
to date  we have not received approval for the sale of any drug candidates in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues from our drug candidates 
development plan our development plan for the next twelve months remains focused on the following endeavors completing the randomized phase ii trial for iv palifosfamide  initiating a registration trial for iv palifosfamide  collecting data for the darinaparsin phase ii trial in hematological malignancies  establishing a registration pathway and seeking additional financial resources to fund on going development of darinaparsin  and conducting the phase i portion of an oral indibulin study in breast cancer 
we expect our material expenditures during this time to be predominately for palifosfamide clinical trial expense  employment expense we currently have full time employees and other expenses associated with clinical trials 
we continue to use senior advisors  consultants  clinical research organizations  and other third parties to perform certain aspects of product development  manufacturing  clinical  and preclinical development  and regulatory  safety and quality assurance functions 
given our current plans to use internal financial resources to develop palifosfamide and pursue the clinical work discussed above  but with the intention of partnering or otherwise raising additional resources to support further development activities for all three product candidates  we expect to incur the following expenses during the next twelve months approximately million on preclinical and regulatory expenses  approximately million on clinical expenses  approximately million on manufacturing expenses  approximately million on facilities  rent  and other facilities related expenses  and approximately million on general corporate and administrative expenses 
with our current cash position  previous adjustments in staffing and ongoing aggressive cash management strategy  we believe that we currently have sufficient capital that will support our current operations very early into our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our future products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this report 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
specifically  we currently anticipate commencing a registration trial for iv palifosfamide as early as the first half of however  we are still in the evaluative phase regarding the protocol design for this trial  including with respect to overall trial size  clinical endpoints and our ability 
table of contents to receive special protocol assessment 
we also continue to evaluate the appropriate number of and locations for trial sites 
we have estimated the sufficiency of our cash resources based on our current expectations for the trial design 
however  the final trial design may ultimately vary from our current expectations  which could materially impact the schedule and cost of the trial and  in turn  alter our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations 
in addition to the amount and timing of expenses related to the planned iv palifosfamide registration trial  our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include  but are not limited to  changes in the focus and direction of our development programs  competitive and technical advances  costs associated with the development of our product candidates  our ability to secure partnering arrangements  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
product candidate development and clinical trials intravenous darinaparsin  an organic arsenic  has been tested in patients with advanced myeloma  other hematological malignancies  and liver cancer 
at the may asco annual meeting  we reported positive results in patients with lymphoma  particularly ptcl  which has led to the planning of a pivotal trial in ptcl subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources 
the phase i trials with an oral form of darinaparsin are ongoing in solid tumors and have been expanded to include non hodgkin s lymphoma patients 
the company is actively seeking partners and other sources of funding for continuing the development program of the iv form in a pivotal trial for ptcl and for continuing additional studies for both iv and oral administration 
technology transfer and scale up for the commercial manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final product specification will continue as the development program and resources allow 
intravenous palifosfamide  the proprietary stabilized form of isophosphoramide mustard  is being developed presently to treat soft tissue sarcoma 
a phase ii trial in advanced sarcoma has been completed with favorable activity and with the expected safety profile 
favorable activity and safety data from a phase i trial of iv palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin were reported at the asco annual meeting 
the company has initiated a randomized phase ii trial designed to compare palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin to doxorubicin alone in the front or second line treatment of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma and recently announced favorable interim efficacy data  thereby ending further enrollment  and presented the results at the november ctos annual meeting 
the company expects to review its data with the fda and ema and  subject to the results of such reviews  plans to initiate a global registration trial as early as the first half of an oral formulation has also been developed preclinically and we plan to initiate a phase i trial following further iv study results and subject to obtaining additional sources of financing from partnering or other arrangements 
other trials are under consideration pending further funding 
orphan drug designation has been obtained for both the united states and the european union for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas 
technology transfer and scale up for the commercial manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final product specification will continue as resources allow 
indibulin  a novel anti cancer agent that targets mitosis by inhibiting tubulin polymerization  is administered as an oral capsule formulation 
indibulin has completed phase i trials with favorable results of activity and safety profile reported for all trials 
phase i trials of indibulin in combination with tarceva tm and also with xeloda tm have been conducted 
at the asco annual meeting  the company presented favorable preliminary activity and safety data of oral indibulin with oral xeloda tm 
preclinical studies under the direction of dr 
larry norton to support clinical study of dose dense dosing are completed and were also reported at asco annual meeting 
the company intends to initiate the phase i portion of a phase i ii study in breast cancer with a schedule identified preclinically to determine maximum tolerated dose in the phase i portion prior to formal phase ii testing

in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases our commitments for operating leases relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in new york  ny and our operations center in boston  massachusetts see note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements clinical trial expenses  fair value measurements  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organizations cro 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
fair value measurements we have warrant liabilities that are measured using fair value 
accounting standards define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
stock based compensation and warrants we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation awards 
in connection with valuing stock options and warrants we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an annual basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic which improves disclosures about fair value measurements 
more specifically  asu updates topic to require disclosure of transfers in and out of levels and and the reason for the transfers 
additionally  it requires separate reporting of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level this update is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain our cash in interest bearing cash accounts 
as all of our investments are cash deposits in a global bank  it is subject to minimal interest rate risk 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct clinical studies outside of the united states primarily in western europe 
these business operations are not material at this time and therefore  any currency fluctuations will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
