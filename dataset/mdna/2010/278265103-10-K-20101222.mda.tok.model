item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and counseling services to high net worth individuals and institutions 
our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels 
in executing this strategy  we have developed a broadly diversified product line and a powerful marketing  distribution and customer service capability 
although we manage and distribute a wide range of products and services  we operate in one business segment  namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts 
we are a market leader in a number of investment areas  including tax managed equity  value equity  equity income  emerging market equity  floating rate bank loan  municipal bond  investment grade  global and high yield bond investing 
our diversified product line offers fund shareholders  retail managed account investors  institutional investors and high net worth clients a wide range of products and services designed and managed to generate attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term 
our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives  risk profiles  income levels and geographic representation 
our income investment strategies cover a broad duration and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax free investments 
as of october   we had billion in assets under management 
our principal retail marketing strategy is to distribute funds and separately managed accounts through financial intermediaries in the advice channel 
we have a broad reach in this marketplace  with distribution partners including national and regional broker dealers  independent broker dealers  independent financial advisory firms  banks and insurance companies 
we support these distribution partners with a team of more than sales professionals covering us and international markets 
we also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high net worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis 
through our wholly owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high net worth marketplace  including corporations  endowments  foundations  family offices and public and private employee retirement plans 
specialized sales teams at our affiliates develop relationships in this market and deal directly with these clients 
our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory  administration  distribution and service fees received from eaton vance funds and investment advisory fees received from separate accounts 
our fees are based primarily on the value of the investment portfolios we manage and fluctuate with changes in the total value and mix of assets under management 
such fees are recognized over the period that we manage these assets 
our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred sales commissions  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  fair value  stock based compensation and non controlling interests 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents market developments prevailing market conditions affect our asset levels  operating results and the recoverability of our investments 
since financial markets bottomed in the first half of fiscal  we have experienced significant improvement in our key financial metrics 
average assets under management increased percent in fiscal over fiscal due to both strong net flows and positive market action  as reflected in the percent increase in the s p index over the fiscal year 
revenue increased faster than our overall expenses in fiscal  resulting in higher operating margins  and our balance sheet continues to provide financial flexibility as more fully described below 
managed asset levels in fiscal  revenue increased relative to fiscal  primarily reflecting an increase in average managed assets due to improving equity markets and positive net flows 
average assets under management were billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal growth in separate account assets  which earn lower fees on average than funds  contributed to a decline in our average effective fee rate to basis points in fiscal from basis points in fiscal as a matter of course  investors in our sponsored open end funds and separate accounts have the ability to redeem their shares or investments at any time  without prior notice  and there are no material restrictions that would prevent them from doing so 
operating results in fiscal  our revenue increased by million  or percent  from fiscal our operating expenses increased by million  or percent  in the same period  reflecting increases in expenses tied to asset levels that increase as assets under management increase  such as certain distribution and service fees  and increases in expenses that adjust to increases in operating earnings  such as the performance based management incentives we accrue 
the increase in our operating expenses also reflects an increase in our sales related expenses  including sales incentives  which vary with the level of sales and the acquisition cost of new assets 
recoverability of our investments in fiscal we used our balance sheet strength to invest in our business  committing excess cash to bring new products to scale to facilitate placement on our distribution partners platforms 
our long term investments of million primarily reflect seed capital investments in new products and strategies 
these investments are generally in liquid debt or equity securities and are carried at fair market value 
accordingly  recoverability of these investments is generally not an area of significant risk to us 
we test our investments  including our investments in collateralized debt obligation cdo entities and investments classified as available for sale  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
our investments in cdo entities  which have been the subject of past impairments  totaled million on october  we evaluate our investments in cdo entities and investments classified as available for sale for impairment using quantitative factors  including how long the investment has been in a net unrealized loss position  and qualitative factors  including the underlying credit quality of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if markets deteriorate during the quarters ahead  our assessment of impairment on a quantitative basis may lead us to impair investments in cdo entities or investments classified as available for sale in future quarters that were in an unrealized loss position at october  we test our investments in affiliates and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or as facts and circumstances indicate that additional analysis is warranted 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  
table of contents we periodically review our deferred sales commissions and identifiable intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  assets under management assets under management of billion on october  were percent higher than the billion reported a year earlier  reflecting improving securities prices and strong open end fund  high net worth and institutional net inflows 
long term fund net inflows of billion over the last fiscal year reflect billion of open end fund net inflows and billion of closed end fund net inflows offset by billion of private fund net outflows 
outflows from private and closed end funds include net reductions in fund leverage of billion in the last twelve months 
high net worth and institutional separate account net inflows were billion and retail managed account net inflows were billion 
market price appreciation  reflecting recovering equity and income markets  contributed billion to growth in managed assets  while a decrease in cash management assets reduced assets under management by billion

in evaluating operating performance we consider operating income and net income  which are calculated on a basis consistent with gaap  as well as adjusted operating income  an internally derived non gaap performance measure 
we define adjusted operating income as operating income excluding the results of consolidated funds and adding back stock based compensation  closed end fund structuring fees  any write off of intangible assets or goodwill associated with our acquisitions and other items we consider non operating in nature 
we believe that adjusted operating income is a key indicator of our ongoing profitability and therefore use this measure as the basis for calculating performance based management incentives 
adjusted operating income is not  and should not be construed to be  a substitute for operating income computed in accordance with gaap 
however  in assessing the performance of the business  our management and our board of directors look at adjusted operating income as a measure of underlying performance  since operating results of consolidated funds and amounts resulting from one time events do not necessarily represent normal results of operations 
in addition  when assessing performance  management and the board look at performance both with and without stock based compensation  a non cash operating expense

in thousands interest income    interest expense    gains and losses on investments and derivatives    nm foreign currency gains losses nm impairment losses on investments   nm total other income expense    interest income decreased by million and million  or percent and percent  in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to a decrease in effective interest rates 

table of contents interest expense was flat year over year in both fiscal and  reflecting interest accrued on our fixed rate senior notes 
in fiscal  we recognized gains on investments totaling million  primarily representing gains on seed investments in separately managed accounts and consolidated funds and derivative positions entered into to hedge those seed investments 
in fiscal  we recognized gains of million and in fiscal we recognized losses of million  primarily representing activity on seed investments 
we recognized impairment losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  related to two cash flow instrument cdo entities and a synthetic cdo entity 
the impairment losses associated with the two cash instrument cdo entities resulted from a decrease in estimated future cash flows from the cdo entities due to increases in the default rates of the underlying loan portfolios 
the impairment loss associated with the synthetic cdo entity  which reduced our investment in that entity to zero in fiscal  resulted from a decrease in the estimated cash flows from the entity due to higher realized default rates and lower recovery rates on the reference securities underlying the synthetic cdo entity s portfolio of credit default swaps 
income taxes our effective tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and equity in net income loss of affiliates was percent  percent and percent in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the execution of a state tax voluntary disclosure agreement in fiscal that resulted in a net reduction in our income tax expense of million and a deferred tax adjustment in fiscal related to stock based compensation expense that resulted in reduction in our income tax expense of million 
our policy for accounting for income taxes includes monitoring our business activities and tax policies for compliance with federal  state and foreign tax laws 
in the ordinary course of business  various taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions we have taken  or applicable law may not be clear 
we periodically review these tax positions and provide for and adjust as necessary estimated liabilities relating to such positions as part of our overall tax provision 
there were no significant changes in our estimates surrounding these positions in either of the periods presented 
equity in net income loss of affiliates  net of tax equity in net income loss of affiliates  net of tax  for fiscal primarily reflects our percent minority equity interest in lloyd george management  a percent minority equity interest in a private equity partnership and our minority interest in eaton vance global macro absolute return advantaged fund percent at fiscal year end 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the net income of the private equity partnership 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  decreased by million in fiscal over the same period a year earlier  primarily due to gains recognized by the private equity partnership partially offset by a decrease in the net income of lloyd george management 
net income attributable to non controlling interests net income attributable to non controlling interests increased by million in fiscal  primarily reflecting an increase of million in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value in fiscal in conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting standard on non controlling interests on november  the standard requires that redeemable non controlling interests be carried at estimated redemption value each reporting period  and that the net change in the estimated redemption 
table of contents value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value be recognized as a component of net income attributable to non controlling interests in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in estimated redemption value is primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our majority owned subsidiaries 
net income attributable to non controlling interests decreased by million in fiscal  primarily due to a million adjustment in fiscal to reverse stock based compensation previously allocated to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries partially offset by an increase in the profitability of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds 
in fiscal  we determined that the allocation of stock based compensation expense to non controlling interest holders reduces our liability to non controlling interest holders in a manner that is not consistent with the agreements governing partnership distributions to those individuals 
the million adjustment represented the reversal of accumulated stock based compensation expense allocated to non controlling interest holders from the date of acquisition 
stock based compensation expense allocated to non controlling interest holders in prior periods was neither quantitatively nor qualitatively material to our consolidated financial statements in any of our previously reported fiscal years or periods 
net income attributable to non controlling interests is not adjusted for taxes due to the underlying tax status of our consolidated subsidiaries

years ended october  in thousands cash flow data operating cash flows    investing cash flows    financing cash flows    liquidity and capital resources liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and investment advisory fees and other receivables 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
short term investments as of october  consisted of an investment in a sponsored short term income fund 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent and percent of total assets on october  and  respectively 
the million decrease in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in cash and cash equivalent balances of million and a decrease of million in short term investments offset by an increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal primarily reflects net cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock of million offset by the payment of million of dividends to shareholders  the repurchase of million of non voting common stock  million of net purchases of available for sale securities  the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors in the third quarter of fiscal and million in contingent payments to the sellers of tabs in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in short term investments can be attributed to the deconsolidation of a cash management fund in the second quarter of fiscal the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal the million decrease in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in cash and short term investment balances of million and a decrease in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the decrease in cash and short term investment balances in fiscal primarily reflects the million initial cost of the acquisition of tabs  the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and atlanta capital management  the payment of million of dividends to shareholders and additions to equipment and leasehold improvements of million  offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million 
the decrease in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the decrease in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal on october   our debt consisted of million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year unsecured notes due we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks that expires on august  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at october  or at any point during the fiscal year 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of october  
table of contents we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
we remain committed to growing our business and expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in new products  acquire shares of our non voting common stock  pay dividends  make strategic acquisitions  enhance technology infrastructure and pay the operating expenses of the business  which are largely variable in nature and fluctuate with revenue and assets under management 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations  which contributed million in fiscal  and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility  are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs and to satisfy our future commitments as more fully described in contractual obligations below 
the risk exists  however  that if we determine we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
income taxes long term deferred income taxes consist principally of deferred income tax benefits associated with stock based compensation and expenses incurred in the launch of new closed end funds  which are capitalized and amortized for tax purposes over a year period following a change in tax accounting method filed in fiscal  offset by deferred income tax liabilities associated with deferred sales commissions and certain deferred tax liabilities associated with a change in tax accounting method related to certain closed end fund expenses 
the net current deferred tax liability of million as of october  principally represents the remaining million deferred tax liability associated with the change in accounting method 
taxes payable at october  included a prepaid balance of million and a long term payable of million  which are included in current assets and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  respectively 
taxes payable at october  included a prepaid balance of million and a long term payable of million  which are included in other current assets and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  respectively

payments due in millions total less than year years years after years operating leases facilities and equipment senior notes interest payment on senior notes investment in private equity partnership unrecognized tax benefits total  minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under noncancelable subleases 
this amount includes unrecognized tax benefits along with accrued interest and penalties 
in july  we committed to invest up to million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
as of october   we had invested million of the maximum million of committed capital 
this remaining commitment is included in the table above 
interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital  fox asset management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisers are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of non controlling interests is predicated  for each subsidiary  on the exercise of a series of puts held by non controlling interest holders and calls held by us 
neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling interest holders of the acquired entities remaining employed by the company 
the puts provide the non controlling interest holders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specific intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the non controlling interest holders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specified intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of an originating non controlling interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any non controlling interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made to purchase non controlling interests have been excluded from the above table  unless a put or call option has been exercised and a mandatory firm commitment exists for us to purchase such non controlling interests 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of non controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
in conjunction with our adoption of a new non controlling interest accounting standard  we have presented all redeemable non controlling interests at estimated redemption value on our balance sheet as of october  we have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at fair value as a component of additional paid in capital and have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value as a component of net income attributable to non controlling interests 
based on our calculations  the estimated redemption value of our non controlling interests  redeemable at either fair value or other than fair value  totaled million on october  compared to million on october  
table of contents in july  the company exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors to sell to us an additional interest in parametric risk advisors for million 
the transaction increased our ownership interest from to percent 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing 
in may  the company exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of parametric portfolio associates to sell to us an additional interest in parametric portfolio associates for million 
the transaction increased our capital ownership interest from percent to percent and our profit interest from percent to percent 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing 
on december   the company acquired the tabs business of md sass  a privately held investment manager based in new york  new york 
the company paid million in cash to acquire the tabs business  including costs associated with the acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company recorded million of intangible assets and a contingent purchase price liability of million 
the company made a contingent payment in the second quarter of fiscal equal to million 
the company will be obligated to make six additional annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december      and all future payments will be paid in cash 
there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect other significant sources and uses of cash  certain significant non cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
significant sources and uses of cash that are not reflected in either revenue or operating expenses include net cash flows associated with our deferred sales commission assets capitalized sales commissions paid net of contingent deferred sales charges received as well as net cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of investments within the portfolios of our consolidated funds and separate accounts proceeds received from the sale of trading investments net of cash outflows associated with the purchase of trading investments 
significant non cash items include the amortization of deferred sales commissions and other intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes 
operating activities also reflect the net change in restricted cash balances in margin accounts used in trading activities related to the hedging of certain investments within consolidated funds and separately managed accounts seeded for the purpose of product development 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal net income increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in our reconciliation of net income to cash provided by operating activities  we adjusted net income for net investment gains of million in fiscal  compared to net investment gains of million in fiscal net investment gains losses in fiscal include million of impairment losses recognized on cdo investments 
we also adjusted net income for the activities of our equity method affiliates  which contributed million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal timing differences in the cash settlement of our short term and long term receivables and payables increased cash provided by operating activities by million in fiscal and reduced cash provided by operating activities by million in fiscal other significant sources and uses of cash include net cash inflows associated with the purchase and sale of trading investments in the portfolios of consolidated funds and separate accounts  which reduced 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and net cash outflows associated with deferred sales commissions  which reduced net cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
significant non cash expenses  including the amortization of deferred sales commissions  other intangible assets and debt issuance costs  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes  increased to million in from million in fiscal  reflecting increases in stock based compensation  the amortization of deferred sales commissions and other depreciation and amortization offset by the net change in deferred income taxes 
the increase in other depreciation and amortization can be primarily attributed to an increase in depreciation expense associated with tenant improvements in connection with our move to new corporate headquarters and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the tabs acquisition 
investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  cash paid in acquisitions  cash payments and receipts on a note receivable from affiliate and the purchase and sale of available for sale investments in our sponsored funds that we do not consolidate 
cash used for investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  additions to equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million  compared to million in fiscal additions in fiscal reflect tenant improvements made in conjunction with our move to new corporate headquarters 
the acquisition of tabs resulted in a net cash payment of million in fiscal as more fully described in contractual obligations above 
in fiscal  the company made million in contingent payments to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
in fiscal  net purchases and sales of available for sale investments reduced investing cash flows by million compared to a contribution of million in the prior fiscal year 
in october  the company  as lender  entered into a subordinated term note agreement the note with a sponsored privately offered equity fund under which the fund may borrow up to million 
the note earns daily interest based on the fund s cost of borrowing under its commercial paper financing facility 
upon expiration on december   the note was extended until december  subject to certain conditions  the privately offered equity fund may prepay the note in whole or in part  at any time  without premium or penalty 
in fiscal  the sponsored private equity fund made payments on the note totaling million  bringing the remaining balance to zero on october  financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect distributions to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds  the purchase of additional non controlling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies and cash paid to meet redemptions by non controlling interest holders of these funds 
cash used for financing activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of our non voting common stock in connection with the grant of restricted share awards  the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends per share were in fiscal  compared to in 
table of contents fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques to measure fair value 
this fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories based on the nature of the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  an investment s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
level unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 
level observable inputs other than level unadjusted quoted market prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which redemptions by the purchasing shareholder are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years from purchase 
distribution plan payments received from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received from redeeming shareholders of these funds are generally applied to reduce our unamortized deferred sales commission assets 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commission asset for impairment on a quarterly basis 
in our impairment analysis  we compare the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset to the 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset in the form of distribution fees over the remaining useful life of the deferred sales commission asset to determine whether impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in operating income as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital  fox asset management and parametric portfolio associates  which share similar economic characteristics  to a single reporting unit 
management believes that the inclusion of these entities in a single reporting unit for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing most accurately reflects the synergies achieved in acquiring these entities  namely centralized distribution of similar products and services to similar clients 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  current period actual results  and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management at the reporting unit level 
budgeted results for future periods are most significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the growth in assets under management  future revenue run rates and future operating margins 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and forward multiples of both revenue and ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
amortized identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 

table of contents non amortizing intangible assets generally represent the cost of mutual fund management contracts acquired 
non amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the management contracts acquired to their carrying values 
if the carrying value of a management contract acquired exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
accounting standards requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and to make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment takes into account our forecast of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods  our experience with the tax attributes expiring unused  tax planning alternatives and other tax considerations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment but are not subject to significant variability 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
non controlling interests effective november   we adopted new accounting standards related to non controlling interests and redeemable non controlling interests and retrospectively applied such provisions to our reported prior periods 
non redeemable non controlling interests have been reclassified to permanent equity with no change in the measurement principles previously applied to these interests 
redeemable non controlling interests remain classified in mezzanine equity as temporary equity and are measured at estimated redemption value as of the balance sheet date 
presentation of net income in our consolidated statements of income has been changed to reflect net income with and without consideration of the non controlling interests 
earnings per share continue to be calculated after consideration of the net income attributable to non controlling interests 
non redeemable non controlling interests non redeemable non controlling interests consist entirely of interests granted to employees of our majority owned subsidiaries under subsidiary specific long term equity plans 
these grants become subject to put rights upon vesting and will be reclassified to temporary equity as vesting occurs 

table of contents redeemable non controlling interests at fair value redeemable non controlling interests at fair value consist of interests in our consolidated funds and interests granted to employees of our majority owned subsidiaries under subsidiary specific long term equity plans 
the company s non controlling interests redeemable at fair value are recorded in temporary equity at estimated redemption value and changes in the estimated redemption value of these interests are recognized as increases or decreases to additional paid in capital 
redeemable non controlling interests at other than fair value the interests in our majority owned subsidiaries are puttable at established multiples of earnings before interest and taxes and  as such  are considered redeemable at other than fair value 
the company s non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value are recorded in temporary equity at estimated redemption value and changes in estimated redemption value are recorded in earnings 
as a result  net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders and earnings per basic and diluted share are impacted by changes in the estimated redemption values of such redeemable non controlling interests 
accounting developments vies in june  the fasb issued literature introducing a new consolidation model 
this new literature prescribes how enterprises account for and disclose their involvement with vies and other entities whose equity at risk is insufficient or lacks certain characteristics 
this new accounting changes how an entity determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie and whether that vie should be consolidated and requires additional disclosures 
as a result  the company must comprehensively review its involvements with vies and potential vies to determine the effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
the new consolidation standard is effective for the company s fiscal year that begins on november  and for interim periods within the first annual reporting period 
earlier application is prohibited 
in february  the fasb issued an amendment to this standard 
for certain investments held by a reporting entity  the amendment indefinitely defers a requirement to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this deferral generally applies to the reporting entities interests in entities that have the attributes of an investment company or that apply the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies  such as the privately offered equity funds in which the company invests 
the new consolidation model will not change the company s conclusions regarding consolidation for vies in which it is involved  with the exception of one vie 
the aforementioned vie is a cdo entity  and the impact of consolidating this vie upon adoption will be to increase the company s total assets and long term debt by approximately billion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from our investments in sponsored equity funds  our equity interest in affiliates  investments in equity securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and investments in equity securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october

in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease trading equity securities    available for sale securities sponsored funds    investment in affiliates    total    currently we have a corporate hedging program in place to hedge currency risk and market price exposures on certain investments in consolidated funds and separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
as part of this program we enter into futures and forward contracts to hedge exposure to certain equity instruments held within the portfolios of these separately managed accounts and consolidated funds 
the contracts negotiated are short term in nature 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes

in addition to utilizing forwards and futures contracts  the company has also entered into transactions in which securities not yet purchased have been sold 
in its short sales  the company has sold securities that have been borrowed from third party brokers with the intention of buying back identical assets at a later date to return to the 
table of contents lender  thereby incurring a liability

in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates trading debt securities  available for sale securities sponsored funds  total  from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interests in the cash instrument cdo entities that are included in long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
as an investor in a cdo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the cdo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery experiences of the underlying instruments held by the cdo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in defaults  cdo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in cdo entities was valued at million as of october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we operate primarily in the united states and accordingly  most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do provide services and earn revenue outside of the 
table of contents united states and the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
our exposure to currency movements will likely increase as our business outside of the united states grows 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
