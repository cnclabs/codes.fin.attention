table of contents our long term success rests on the shoulders of the leadership team and its ability to effectively enhance the performance of the company 
as a financial services company  we are in the business of taking and managing risks 
whether we are successful depends largely upon whether we take the right risks and get paid appropriately for those risks 
our governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of the company s business effectively through an integrated process that includes financial  strategic  risk and leadership planning 
we define risks to include not only credit  market and liquidity risk  the traditional concerns for financial institutions  but also operational risks  including risks related to systems  processes or external events  as well as legal  regulatory and reputation risks 
our management processes  structures  and policies help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision making and accountability 
results are important  but equally important is how we achieve those results 
our core values and commitment to high ethical standards is material to sustaining public trust and confidence in our company 
risk management overview through our corporate governance structure  risk and return is evaluated to produce sustainable revenues  reduce risks of earnings volatility and increase shareholder value 
the financial services industry is exposed to four major risks  liquidity  credit  market and operational 
liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates 
credit risk is the inability of a customer to meet its repayment obligations 
market risk is the fluctuation in asset and liability values caused by changes in market prices and yields  and operational risk is the potential for losses resulting from events involving people  processes  technology  legal issues  external events  regulation  or reputation 
board committees our corporate governance structure begins with our board of directors 
the board of directors evaluates risk through the chief executive officer ceo and four board committees the loan committee reviews credit risks and the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the asset liability management committee alco reviews liquidity and market risks 
the audit and qualified legal compliance committee reviews the scope and coverage of internal and external audit activities  and the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates corporate governance structure  charters  committee performance and acts in best interests of the corporation and its shareholders with regard to the appointment of director nominees 
these committees review reports from management  the company s auditors  and other outside sources 
on the basis of materials that are available to them and on which they rely  the committees review the performance of the company s management and personnel  and establish policies  but neither the committees nor their individual members in their capacities as members of the board of directors are responsible for daily operations of the company 
in particular  risk management activities relating to individual loans are undertaken by company personnel in accordance with the policies established by the committees of the board of directors 
senior leadership committees to ensure that our risk management goals and objectives are accomplished  oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities are conducted through five senior leadership committees comprised of members of management the senior leadership committee establishes short and long term strategies and operating plans 
the committee establishes performance measures and reviews performance to plan on a monthly basis the credit round table committee recommends corporate credit administration practices and limits including industry concentration limits  approval requirements  and exceptions the technology steering committee establishes technological strategies  makes technology investment decisions  and manages the implementation process the alco round table committee establishes and monitors liquidity ranges  pricing  maturities  investment goals  and interest spread on balance sheet accounts and 
table of contents the sox compliance committee has established the master plan for full documentation of the company s internal controls and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of risk management controls we use various controls to manage risk exposure within the company 
budgeting and planning processes provide for early indication of unplanned results or risk levels 
models are used to estimate market risk and net interest income sensitivity 
segmentation analysis is used to estimate expected and unexpected credit losses 
compliance with regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management 
our code of ethics provides the guidelines for all employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity  liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events 
alco is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the accounting department is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies 
asset liquidity sources consist of the repayments and maturities of loans  selling of loans  short term money market investments  maturities and sales of securities from the available for sale security portfolio 
increased available for sale security balances were responsible for the major use of liquidity  followed by growth in the loan portfolio 
the weighted average life of the available for sale security portfolio is years 
liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and federal home loan bank borrowings 
we emphasize preserving and maximizing customer deposits and other customer based funding sources 
deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives 
we have available correspondent banking lines of credit through correspondent relationships totaling approximately million and available secured borrowing lines of approximately million with the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
in addition  we periodically obtain secured borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco reserve bank and had million in available borrowing lines at the reserve bank 
while these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of liquidity in the future  their mix  as well as the possible use of other sources  will depend on future economic and market conditions 
liquidity is also provided through cash flows generated through our operations 
our liquid assets cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits held at other banks  and available for sale securities totaled million or of total assets at december   million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  in  the holding company s primary source of funding was cash dividends from the bank 
the holding company expects to receive dividends from the bank in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the restrictions on the bank s ability to pay dividends 
to accommodate future growth and business needs  we develop an annual capital expenditure budget during strategic planning sessions 
we expect that our earnings  acquisition of core deposits and wholesale borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to support liquidity needs in other borrowings we actively use federal home loan bank fhlb advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide liquidity and to implement leverage strategies 
at december   our fhlb long term advance was at a fixed rate 
at december  our fhlb short term advances were fixed term borrowings without call or put features 
at december  we had million in fhlb advances outstanding compared to million at december  and million at december

credit risk exists in our outstanding loans  letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments 
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower  repayment sources and the nature of underlying collateral given current events and conditions 
commercial portfolio credit risk management commercial credit risk management begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower s financial position in light of current industry  economic or geopolitical trends 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower  each commercial credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on existing credit approval standards 
risk grading is a substantial factor in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
credit decisions are determined by credit administration to certain limitations and approvals from the loan committee above certain limitations 
credit risk is continuously monitored by credit administration for possible adjustment if there has been a change in the borrower s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements 
the primary sources of repayment of our commercial loans are from the borrowers operating cash flows and the borrowers conversion of short term assets to cash 
the net assets of the borrower or guarantor are usually identified as a secondary source of repayment 
the principal factors affecting our risk of loss from commercial lending include each borrower s ability to manage its business affairs and cash flows  local and general economic conditions and real estate values in our service area 
we manage our commercial loan portfolio by monitoring our borrowers payment performance and their respective financial condition and make periodic adjustments  if necessary  to the risk grade assigned to each loan in the portfolio 
our evaluations of our borrowers are facilitated by management s knowledge of local market conditions and periodic reviews by a consultant of our credit administration policies 
real estate portfolio credit risk management the principal source of repayment of our real estate construction loans is the sale of the underlying collateral or the availability of permanent financing from the company or other lending source 

table of contents the principal risks associated with real estate construction lending include project cost overruns that absorb the borrower s equity in the project and deterioration of real estate values as a result of various factors  including competitive pressures and economic downturns 
we manage our credit risk associated with real estate construction lending by establishing a loan to value ratio on projects on an as completed basis  inspecting project status in advance of disbursements  and matching maturities with expected completion dates 
generally  we require a loan to value ratio of not more than on single family residential construction loans 
our specific underwriting standards and methods for each principal line of lending include industry accepted analysis and modeling and certain proprietary techniques 
our underwriting criteria are designed to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines  including required loan to value ratios 
our credit administration policies contain mandatory lien position and debt service coverage requirements  and the bank generally requires a guarantee from individuals owning or more of the borrowing entity 
concentrations of credit risk portfolio credit risk is evaluated with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in unacceptable levels of risk 
concentrations of credit exposure can be measured in various ways including industry  product  geography  and customer relationship 
we review non real estate commercial loans by industry and real estate loans by geographic location and property type 
nonperforming assets our practice is to place an asset on nonaccrual status when one of the following events occurs i any installment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless in management s opinion the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  ii management determines the ultimate collection of principal or interest to be unlikely or iii the terms of the loan have been renegotiated due to a serious weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
nonperforming loans include impaired loans which may be on non accrual  are days past due and still accruing  or have been restructured 
allowance for loan and lease losses alll the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio 
within the allowance  reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income in the provision for loan and lease losses 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectability 
we evaluate general conditions such as the portfolio composition  size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured  unsecured  construction  and small business administration sba 
we also evaluate concentrations of borrowers  industries  geographical sectors  loan product  loan classes and collateral types  volume and trends of loan delinquencies and non accrual  criticized and classified assets and trends in the aggregate in significant credits identified as watch list items 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation based on certain observable data that management believes most reflects the underlying credit losses being estimated 
changes in the amount of each component of the allowance for loan losses are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data  taking into account the interaction of the components over time 
an essential element of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses is our credit risk evaluation process  which includes credit risk grading of individual  commercial  construction  commercial real estate  and consumer loans 
loans are assigned credit risk grades based on our assessment of conditions that affect the borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement 
that process includes reviewing borrower s current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and other information specific to each individual borrower 
loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management become aware of information affecting the borrower s ability to fulfill its obligations 
credit risk grades carry a dollar weighted risk percentage 

table of contents for individually impaired loans  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan  we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions  including the effect of existing environmental factors 
in addition to the alll  an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding and the associated inherent credit risk 
this reserve is carried as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
we make provisions to the alll on a regular basis through charges to operations that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as provision expense for loan losses 
when a loan is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
any recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited back to the allowance 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan portfolio 
various regulatory agencies periodically review our alll as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require us to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provisions for possible loan losses in future periods 
the alll should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs in future periods will occur in the stated amounts or proportions 
the following table summarizes the activity in the alll reserves for the periods indicated

market risk is inherent in our operating positions and activities including customers loans  deposit accounts  securities and long term debt 
loans and deposits generate income and expense  respectively  and the value of cash flows changes based on general economic levels  and most importantly  the level of interest rates 
the goal for managing our assets and liabilities is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the company to undue interest rate risk 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
we do not operate a trading account  and do not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange 
we face market risk through interest rate volatility 
net interest income or margin risk is measured based on rate shocks over different time horizons versus a current stable interest rate environment 
assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used in the planning and budgeting model 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis with alco 
securities portfolio the securities portfolio is central to our asset liability management strategies 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and regulatory requirements 
we classify our securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
we do not engage in trading activities 
securities held to maturity is carried at cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
securities available for sale may be sold to implement our asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors 
securities available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses  net of income taxes  are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  in a separate component of shareholders equity 
gain or loss on sale of securities is based on the specific identification method 

table of contents operational risk management operational risk is the potential for loss resulting from events involving people  processes  technology  legal or regulatory issues  external events  and reputation 
in keeping with the corporate governance structure  the senior leadership committee is responsible for operational risk controls 
operational risks are managed through specific policies and procedures  controls and monitoring tools 
examples of these include reconciliation processes  transaction monitoring and analysis and system audits 
operational risks fall into two major categories  business specific and company wide 
the senior leadership committee works to ensure consistency in policies  processes and assessments 
with respect to company wide risks  the senior leadership committee works directly with members of our board of directors to develop policies and procedures for information security  business resumption plans  compliance and legal issues 
critical accounting policies general our significant accounting principles are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
bank of commerce holdings consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
some of our accounting principles require significant judgment to estimate values of assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying the complex accounting principles to transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
valuation of investments and impairment of securities invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the fair value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or equity 
our investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other than temporary 
a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the alco committee reviews the investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis  with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available 
any decline that is determined to be other than temporary is recorded as an other than temporary impairment otti loss in the results of operations in the period in which the determination occurred 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost adjusted for accretion  amortization and otti  otherwise defined as an unrealized loss 
when an investment is impaired  the impairment is evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or other than temporary 
when an investment is impaired  we assess whether to sell the security  or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit losses 
for debt securities that are considered other than temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is calculated as the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
the remaining differences between the investment s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income 
significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an otti has occurred for an investment 
the company follows a consistent and systematic process for determining and recording an otti loss 
the company has designated the alco committee responsible for the otti process 
the alco committee s assessment of whether an otti loss should be recognized incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information 

table of contents the alco committee s assessment of whether an otti loss should be recognized incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information 
the alco committee considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook 
allowance for loan and lease losses alll the allowance for loan and lease losses is management s best estimate of the probable losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting 
that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and that losses be accrued based on the differences between that value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectability 
these evaluations include general conditions such as the portfolio composition  size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured  unsecured  construction  and small business administration sba 
additional factors include concentrations of borrowers  industries  geographical sectors  loan product  loan classes and collateral types  volume and trends of loan delinquencies and non accrual  criticized and classified assets and trends in the aggregate in significant credits identified as watch list items 
there are several components to the determination of the adequacy of the alll 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
for those segments that require an alll  we estimate loan losses on a monthly basis based upon its ongoing loan review process and analysis of loan performance 
we follow a systematic and consistently applied approach to select the most appropriate loss measurement methods and support our conclusions and rationale with written documentation 
one method of estimating loan losses for groups of loans is through the application of loss rates to the groups aggregate loan balances 
such rates typically reflect historical loss experience for each group of loans  adjusted for relevant economic factors over a defined period of time 
we evaluate and modify our loss estimation model as needed to ensure that the resulting loss estimate is consistent with gaap 
when a loan is individually impaired  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient we may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan  we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions  including the effect of existing environmental factors 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
the cost is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
that cost must be recognized in the income statement over the service period of the award 
in addition  expense must be recognized in the income statement for unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
during  the fair value of options granted was determined on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions a current volatility rate of  a risk fee interest rate of based upon the five year treasury coupon rate at the time the options were issued  expected dividends of per share per year current dividend payout  an annual dividend rate of  an assumed forfeiture rate of zero and an expected life of seven years 

table of contents revenue recognition our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income it receives on interest earning assets and the interest expense it pays on interest bearing liabilities 
another source of revenue is fee income  which includes fees earned on deposit services  income from sba lending  electronic based cash management services  mortgage brokerage fee income and merchant credit card processing services 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
note to the consolidated financial statements offers an explanation of the process for determining when the accrual of interest income is discontinued on an impaired loan 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
mortgages held for sale through our majority owned subsidiary  bank of commerce mortgage  we originate residential mortgage loans within bank of commerce s geographic market  as well as on a nationwide basis 
mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by one to four family residential real estate and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
these loans are typically sold to primary mortgage market aggregators fannie mae  freddie mac  and ginnie mae and to third party investors including the servicing rights 
mortgages held for sale are carried at the lower of cost of fair value 
cost generally approximates fair value  given the short duration of these assets 
gains and losses on loan sales are recorded in noninterest income  and direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in noninterest income upon sale of a loan 
we generally sell all servicing rights associated with the mortgage loans 
accordingly  there are no separately recognized servicing assets or liabilities resulting from the sale of mortgage loans 
derivative loan commitments through our majority owned subsidiary  bank of commerce mortgage  we enter into forward delivery contracts to sell residential mortgage loans at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage loan commitments 
generally  the company enters into a best efforts interest rate lock commitment irlc with borrowers and forward delivery contracts with investors associated with mortgage loans receivable held for sale 
our derivative instruments consist primarily of irlc s executed with borrowers and mandatory forward purchase commitments with investor lenders 
these derivative instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges  with the changes in fair value reflected in earnings as a component of mortgage brokerage fee income

we purchased a pool of performing residential mortgage loans with an estimated fair value of million during the period 
deposit growth was up million or of which million was centered in core checking and savings accounts 
management has taken aggressive steps throughout the year in provisioning for loan losses  charging down impairments  and keeping an attentive eye on expenses 
was an extremely challenging year for credit  and management took an aggressive stance in recognizing impaired loans 

table of contents our loan portfolio remains strained 
the commercial and industrial portfolio experienced deterioration in while real estate development properties and construction related lending remains under stress 
our loan portfolio will likely continue to be influenced by weakness in real estate values  the effects of higher energy prices and higher unemployment levels 
net charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the charge offs were centered in commercial and industrial loans as well as real estate loans 
three properties were classified as other real estate owned oreo during during fiscal year one of the respective properties was sold  resulting in a  gain on sale 
oreo was million at december  and million at december  we are committed to working with our customers to find potential solutions when our customers experience financial difficulties 
elevated provisions are associated with an aggressive reclassification of loans following the completion of a total portfolio review and management s aggressive stance in recognizing impaired loans 
we have provided million in provisions for loan and lease losses compared to million a year ago 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans at december  compared to of total loans at the end of we continue to maintain a relatively low risk and liquid available for sale investment portfolio 
the portfolio provided an effective source of liquidity in funding loan growth for approximately million in net investments  primarily in mortgage backed securities  were liquidated and greatly contributed to funding million in loan growth 
the capital ratios of bank of commerce continue to be above well capitalized guidelines established by regulatory agencies 
with our strong capital position  we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  attractive loan and asset purchases  and any other strategic opportunities 
sources of income we derive our income from two principal sources i net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we receive on interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities  and ii fee income  which includes fees earned on deposit services  income from payroll processing  electronic based cash management services  mortgage brokerage fee income and merchant credit card processing services 
our income depends to a great extent on net interest income 
these interest rate characteristics are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  inflation  recession  and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  and the federal reserve board in particular 
because of our predisposition to variable rate pricing on our assets and level of time deposits  we are considered asset sensitive 
consequently  we benefit in a rising rate environment and we are affected adversely by declining interest rates 
net interest income reflects both our net interest margin  which is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding  and the amount of earning assets we hold 
as a result  changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our earnings 
increase or decreases in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  and cause our net interest margin to expand or contract 
many of our assets are tied to prime rate  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates fall  the yield we earn on our assets may fall faster than the repricing opportunities of our liabilities  causing our net interest margin to contract until the repricing of liabilities catches up 

table of contents changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  which means that short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction  magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve 
there is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed 
for example  if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes  we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments 
to reduce our interest rate risk  we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios  refinance our debt and take other strategic actions which may result in losses or expenses 
mortgage brokerage services are performed by bank of commerce mortgage subsidiary 
mortgage brokerage services offers residential real estate loans with ten offices in three different states and licenses in california  oregon  washington  idaho and colorado 
mortgages that are originated are sold  servicing included  in the secondary market or directly to correspondent financial institutions 
we derive fee income from our mortgage brokerage services 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reported net income of million and net income to common shareholders of million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately million or  over net income of million for the year ended december  the increase can be primarily attributed to loan growth funded with low cost deposits and repricing wholesale borrowings with the resulting effect expanding our net interest margin and net income for the year 
gains on the sale of securities also contributed to the year over year positive variance 
during  we increased provisions for loan and lease losses significantly 
increased provisions are directly attributed to deterioration in the commercial and industrial portfolio and continuing weakness in our real estate portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses increased to million in from million in ongoing credit quality reviews identified impairment within the portfolio and greatly contributed to increased provisions in non performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to compared to in the decrease in non performing assets is primarily attributed to a bulk sale of non performing assets in the second quarter of on april   we completed a loan swap transaction which included the purchase of a portfolio of individual tax identification number itin residential mortgage loans 
the itin portfolio was purchased from a private equity firm in exchange for a combination of approximately million in non performing loans and cash of approximately million 
the non performing loans were transferred without recourse and were carried at fair value  in accordance with applicable accounting standards

asset quality we concentrate our lending activities primarily within el dorado  placer  sacramento  shasta  and tehama counties in california  and the location of the bank s four full services branches  specifically identified as northern california 
we manage our credit risk through diversification of our loan portfolio and the application of underwriting policies and procedures and credit monitoring practices 
although we have a diversified loan portfolio  a significant portion of our borrowers ability to repay the loans is dependent upon the professional services and investor commercial real estate sectors 
generally  the loans are secured by real estate or other assets located in california and are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrower s business or cash flows from real estate investments

nonperforming or impaired loans may be on non accrual  are days past due and still accruing  or have been restructured 
accruals are resumed on loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when the loan is estimated to be fully collectible 
restructured loans are those loans on which concessions in terms have been granted due to the borrower s financial or legal difficulties 
we evaluate our itin loan portfolio somewhat differently than our other credits in determining whether a loan should be placed on nonaccrual status 
our current policy in regards to our itin portfolio  due to our put back rights and the underlying private mortgage insurance associated with these credits has been to monitor the credits closely in conjunction with third party servicers to determine the appropriate action to take

the objective of effective capital management is to produce above market long term returns by using capital when returns are perceived to be high and issuing capital when costs are perceived to be low 
our potential sources of capital include retained earnings  common and preferred stock issuance  and issuance of subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on a day to day basis by our management and reported to our board of directors on a monthly basis 
the regulators of the bank measure capital adequacy by using a risk based capital framework and by monitoring compliance with minimum leverage ratio guidelines 
under the risk based capital standard  assets reported on our balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which is assigned a risk weight 
this standard characterizes an institution s capital as being tier capital defined as principally comprising shareholders equity and tier capital defined as principally comprising the qualifying portion of the alll 
the minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets  including certain off balance sheet items  is 
at least one half of the total risk based capital is to be comprised of common equity  the balance may consist of debt securities and a limited portion of the alll 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
management believes as of december  and  that we and the bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  an institution must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the following table 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the bank s category 
our and the bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table

bank of commerce holdings qualified for this highly selective program and received capital investment in november of this capital investment enabled us to leverage into both investments and residential loans intended to support the housing markets  as well as to increase local lending limits to support our communities 
with our strong capital position  we find significantly more opportunities now for loan growth  investment portfolio purchases and attractive loan and asset purchases 
lending transactions with related parties the business we conduct with directors  officers  significant shareholders and other related parties collectively  related parties is restricted and governed by various laws and regulations  including regulation o as promulgated and enforced by the federal reserve 
furthermore  it is our policy to conduct business with related parties on an arm s length basis at current market prices with terms and conditions no more favorable than we provide in the normal course of business 
some of our directors  officers and principal shareholders of the company and their associates were customers of and had banking transactions with the bank in the ordinary course of business during and the bank expects to have such transactions in the future 
all loans and commitments to loans included in such transactions were made in compliance with the applicable laws on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons of similar creditworthiness  and in our opinion did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features 
an analysis of the activity in related party loans consists of the following as of december  as of december  balance at beginning of year new loan additions advances on existing lines of credit principal repayments balance at end of year 
table of contents impact of inflation inflation affects our financial position as well as operating results 
it is our opinion that the effects of inflation for the three years ended december  on the financial statements have not been material 
commitments off balance sheet financial instruments in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions which involve financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions may involve  to varying degrees  credit and interest rate risk more than the amount  if any recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our off balance sheet credit risk exposure is the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit 
we apply the same credit standards to these contracts we use for loans recorded on the balance sheet 
as of december  as of december  off balance sheet commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit guaranteed commitments outstanding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
these commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by us if certain conditions of the contract are violated 
although currently subject to draw down  many of the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral held relating to these commitments varies  but generally includes real estate  securities  and cash 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay us upon default of performance 
collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer s creditworthiness  but may include cash and securities 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit bear similar credit risk characteristics as outstanding loans 
we have mortgage loan purchase agreements with various mortgage bankers 
we are obligated to perform certain procedures in accordance with these agreements 
the agreements provide for conditions whereby we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans for various reasons among which are either a mortgage loan is originated in violation of the mortgage banker s requirement  we breach any term of the agreement and an early payment default occurs from a mortgage originated by us 
the mortgage loan repurchase agreements are consistent with the standard representations and warranties of the loan sales agreements and the impact is considered immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
we entered into a mandatory forward loan volume commitment agreement with a purchaser of mortgage loans 
under the agreement  we are committed to deliver  in loan volume over the period from march  through may  upon failure to deliver minimum loan volume quarterly  we are responsible to pay a non delivery fee to the purchaser 
as of december   we met the volume commitments 
we are currently in the process of renegotiating and amending this agreement

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rates 
the risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our banking business  our asset liability management alm process  and credit risk mitigation activities 
traditional loan and deposit products are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities 
these positions are subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in economic value of our loans and deposits  as well as our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk as part of the alm process 
interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our financial instruments 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect net interest income 
interest rates risk is measured as the potential volatility in our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
lending and deposit gathering creates interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities as well as the impact of ever changing market conditions is mitigated using the alm process 
we do not operate a trading account and do not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodities 
we face market risk through interest rate volatility 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for our interest rate risk management policies 
we have an asset liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the internal alco roundtable group maintains a net interest income forecast using different rate scenarios via a simulation model 
this group updates the net interest income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic and market conditions 
the simulation model used includes measures of the expected repricing characteristics of administered rate now  savings and money market accounts and non related products demand deposit accounts  other assets and other liabilities 
these measures recognize the relative sensitivity of these accounts to changes in market interest rates  as demonstrated through current and historical experience  recognizing the timing differences of rate changes 
in the simulation of net interest margin and net income the forecast balance sheet is processed against five rate scenarios 
these five rate scenarios include a flat rate environment  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future and four additional rate ramp scenarios ranging for to basis points in basis point increments  unless the rate environment cannot move in these basis point increments before reaching zero 
the formal policies and practices we adopted to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure measure risk in two ways i repricing opportunities for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and ii changes in net interest income for declining interest rate shocks of to basis points 
because of our predisposition to variable rate pricing and noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  we are asset sensitive 
as a result  management anticipates that  in a declining interest rate environment  our net interest income and margin would be expected to decline  and  in an increasing interest rate environment  our net interest income and margin would be expected to increase 
however  no assurance can be given that under such circumstances we would experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
because we are asset sensitive  we are adversely affected by declining rates rather than rising rates 

table of contents to estimate the effect of interest rate shocks on our net interest income  management uses a model to prepare an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income given a change in the federal funds rate of   or basis points up or down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income 
the most recent model results indicate the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a   and basis point decline in the federal funds rate was   and  respectively 
at december   the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a and basis point decline in the federal funds rate was  and  respectively  with a similar and opposite results attributable to a or basis point increase in the federal funds rate 
the alco has established a policy limitation to interest rate risk of of the net interest margin and of the present value of equity 
the securities portfolio is integral to our asset liability management process 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity  regulatory requirements and the relative mix of our cash positions 
our approach to managing interest rate risk may include the use of derivatives 
this helps to minimize significant  unplanned fluctuations in earnings  fair values of assets and liabilities and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
this approach involves an off balance sheet instrument with the same characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin and cash flows 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  hedged assets and liabilities will gain or lose market value 
in a fair value hedging strategy  the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities 
for a cash flow hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative to the extent that it is effective is recorded through other comprehensive income 
we may use derivatives as part of our interest rate risk management  including interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
at inception  the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items is formally documented with our risk management objective  strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness of the hedge transactions 
this includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific transactions 
periodically  as required  we formally assess whether the derivative we designated in the hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
the following table sets forth the most recent model results relating to the distribution of repricing opportunities for the bank s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it also reports the gap different volumes of rate sensitive assets and liabilities repricing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at different time intervals  the cumulative gap  the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for each repricing interval  and the cumulative gap to total assets 
within months to one year to over five dollars in thousands months one year five years years total interest earning assets available for sale securities other investments loans  gross total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities gap in dollars cumulative gap in dollars as a percentage of earning assets gap ratio cumulative gap ratio gap as of earning assets cumulative gap as of earning assets 
table of contents the model utilized by management to create the analysis described in the preceding paragraph uses balance sheet simulation to estimate the impact of changing rates on our projected annual net interest income actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
management believes that the short duration of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities contributes to its ability to reprice a significant amount of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities and mitigate the impact of rate changes in excess of   or basis points 
the model s primary benefit to management is its assistance in evaluating the impact that future strategies with respect to our mix and level of rate sensitive assets and liabilities will have on our net interest income
