application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed  and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination  and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes  indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two to three weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered  and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventory 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with land acquisition and development  and home construction 
inventory is recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land may be impaired 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventory includes capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
the company assesses inventory for recoverability on a quarterly basis  by reviewing for impairment whenever events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  the margins on homes that have been delivered  margins on sales contracts in backlog  projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  projected margins with regard to future land sales  and the value of the land itself 
we pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace  and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward 
from this review  we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their undiscounted cash flows 
in addition  we also evaluate communities where management intends to lower the sales price or offer incentives in order to improve absorptions even if the community s historical results do not indicate a potential for impairment 
for those communities deemed to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the communities exceeds the fair value of the communities 
in addition  due to the fact that the estimates and assumptions included in the company s cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends  it does not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions that may lead the company to incur additional impairment charges in the future 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis 
our analysis is completed on a quarterly basis at a community level  therefore  changes in local conditions may affect one or several of our communities 
for the year ended december   the company evaluated all active communities for impairment indicators 
a recoverability analysis was performed for of those active communities  and an impairment charge was recorded in of those communities 
the carrying value of those impaired communities was million at december  for all of the categories listed below  the key assumptions relating to the valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
local market specific factors that may impact these projected assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales pace  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts  and community specific strategies regarding speculative homes 
operating communities 
for existing operating communities  the recoverability of assets is measured on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales 
these estimated cash flows are developed based primarily on management s assumptions relating to the specific community 
the significant assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of assets include the timing of development and or marketing phases  projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  the estimated land development  home construction and selling costs of the community  overall market supply and demand  the local market  and competitive conditions 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
some of the most critical assumptions in the company s cash flow model are projected absorption pace for home sales  sales prices and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis 
in order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in the company s cash flow model  the company analyzes historical absorption pace in the community as well as other communities in the geographical area 
in addition  the company analyzes internal and external market studies and trends  which generally include  but are not limited to  statistics on population demographics  unemployment rates and availability of competing product in the geographic area where a community is located 
when analyzing the company s historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies  the company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters as well as forecasted population demographics  unemployment rates and availability of competing product 
in order to determine the assumed sales prices included in its cash flow models  the company analyzes the historical sales prices realized on homes it delivered in the community and other communities in the geographic area as well as the sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities 
in addition  the company analyzes internal and external market studies and trends  which generally include  but are not limited to  statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices on similar products in non neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located 
when analyzing its historical sales prices and corresponding market studies  the company also places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends 
ultimately  upon this analysis  the company sets a current sales price for each house type in the community  using the aforementioned information  which it believes will achieve an acceptable gross margin and sales pace in the community 
this price becomes the price published to the sales force for use in its sales efforts 
the company then uses the average of these published sales prices in its cash flow model 
in order to arrive at the company s assumed costs to build and deliver homes  the company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors and subcontractors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure 
with respect to overhead included in the cash flow model  the company uses forecasted rates included in the company s annual budget for the overall market area adjusted for actual experience that is materially different than budgeted rates 
future communities 
for raw land or land under development that management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales  consistent with the evaluations performed for operating communities discussed above 
for raw land  land under development or lots that management intends to market for sale to a third party  but that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as land held for sale as discussed below  the recoverability of the assets is determined based on either the estimated net sales proceeds expected to be realized on the sale of the assets or the estimated fair value determined using cash flow valuation techniques 
if the company has not yet determined whether raw land or land under development will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or marketed for sale to a third party  the company assesses the recoverability of the inventory using a probability weighted approach 
land held for sale 
land held for sale includes land that meets all of the following six criteria management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
the company records land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions  market analysis and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  as well as actual contracts 
if the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
for all of the above categories  the key assumptions relating to the above valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
these and other local market specific factors that may impact project assumptions discussed above are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasted assumptions for each community 
quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments 
the sales objectives can differ between communities  even within a given sub market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
furthermore  the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace  selling strategies  or discount rates  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
as of december   our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions over time  along with a gradual increase in costs 
these assumed gradual increases generally begin in  depending on the market and community 
if communities are not recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of a community is determined by discounting management s cash flow projections using an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate 
as of december   we utilized discount rates ranging from to in the above valuations 
the discount rate used in determining each asset s fair value depends on the community s projected life  development stage  and the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream as well as current risk free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums 
for example  construction in progress inventory  which is closer to completion  will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development 
we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community  while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates 
due to the uncertainties related to our operations and our industry as a whole as further discussed in risk factors beginning on page of this annual report on form k  we are unable to determine at this time if and to what extent continuing changes in our local markets will result in future impairments 
consolidated inventory not owned 
we enter into land option agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we typically provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at pre determined prices 
if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity  the company s deposit including letters of credit represents a variable interest in the entity  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include the amount of the deposit in relation to the fair value of the land  the expected timing of our purchase of the land  and assumptions about projected cash flows 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
we also periodically enter into lot option arrangements with third parties to whom we have sold our raw land inventory 
we evaluate these to determine if we should record an asset and liability at the time we sell the land and enter into the lot option contract 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
in our judgment  we have determined that these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they have sufficient equity to finance their operations 
we must use our judgment to determine if we have substantive control of these entities 
if we were to determine that we have substantive control  we would be required to consolidate the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have substantive control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions  and continuing involvement 
in the event an entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations  we would be required to use judgment to determine if we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have substantive control to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
based on the application of our accounting policies  these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
the company evaluates its investment in unconsolidated limited liabilities companies unconsolidated llcs for potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value and the company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary  the company would write down the value of the investment to fair value 
the determination of whether an investment s fair value is less than the carrying value requires management to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future contributions to the unconsolidated llc  the timing of distribution of lots to the company from the unconsolidated llc  the projected fair value of the lots at the time of distribution to the company  and the estimated proceeds from  and timing of  the sale of land or lots to third parties 
in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs  the company evaluates the projected cash flows associated with each one 
as of december   the company used a discount rate of in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs 
in addition to the assumptions management must make to determine if the investment s fair value is less than the carrying value  management must also use judgment in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the factors management considers are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the unconsolidated llc for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in situations where the investments are equity financed by the partners  and the joint venture simply distributes lots to its partners  the company evaluates other than temporary by preparing an undiscounted cash flow model as described in inventory above for operating communities 
if such model results in positive value versus carrying value  and the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value  the company determines that the impairment is temporary  otherwise  the company determines that the impairment is other than temporary and impairs the investment 
because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the investment is not impaired in the current period but  due to passage of time or change in market conditions leading to changes in assumptions  impairment could occur 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including environmental indemnifications  guarantees of the completion of land development  and minimum net worth guarantees of m i financial 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnifications could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals are recorded for warranties under the following warranty programs home builder s limited warranty effective for homes closed after september   year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed after april   and year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed between september  and april  the warranty accruals for the home builder s limited warranty as a percentage of average sales price  and the structural warranty accruals are established on a per unit basis 
our warranty accruals are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates  which reflect both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  up to  per employee s lifetime 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim  with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open case reserves 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and a million deductible in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and please see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the year to date expenses 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation by recognizing compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and the expected term of the option 
in addition  when we first issue share based awards  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss  and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives 
in determining the fair value of irlcs  m i financial considers the value of the resulting loan if sold in the secondary market 
the fair value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for along with the value of servicing release premiums 
subsequent to inception  m i financial estimates an updated fair value which is compared to the initial fair value 
in addition  m i financial uses fallout estimates which fluctuate based on the rate of the irlc in relation to current rates 
gains or losses are recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value  with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
income taxes valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under applicable tax law 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of a company s net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset  and existing backlog that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures 
examples of negative evidence may include the existence of cumulative losses defined as a pre tax cumulative loss for the business cycle in our case four years  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  and unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
we evaluate this based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable  and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
the company s current and prior year losses present the most significant negative evidence as to whether the company needs to reduce its deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we are now in a four year cumulative pre tax loss position during the years through we currently believe the cumulative weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and  as a result  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
therefore  as of december   the company had a total valuation allowance of million recorded 
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
future adjustments to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets 
in  we do not expect to record any additional tax benefits as the carryback has been exhausted 
additionally  our determination with respect to recording a valuation allowance may be further impacted by  among other things additional inventory impairments  additional pre tax operating losses  the utilization of tax planning strategies that could accelerate the realization of certain deferred tax assets  or changes in relevant tax law 
additionally  due to the considerable estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to either increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
income taxes tax positions 
the company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in tax returns  and records the associated tax benefit or liability 
tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and penalties for all uncertain tax positions are recorded within benefit provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
income tax receivable 
income tax receivable consists of tax refunds that the company expects to receive within one year 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively of income tax receivable 
results of operations the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance in various ways  including the results of our nine individual homebuilding operating segments and the results of the financial services operations  the results of our three homebuilding regions  and our consolidated financial results 
we have determined our reportable segments as follows midwest homebuilding  florida homebuilding  mid atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have similar operations and exhibit similar economic characteristics 
our homebuilding operations include the acquisition and development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes  and the occasional sale of lots and land to third parties 
the homebuilding operating segments that comprise each of our reportable segments are as follows midwest florida mid atlantic columbus  ohio tampa  florida washington  dc cincinnati  ohio orlando  florida charlotte  north carolina indianapolis  indiana raleigh  north carolina chicago  illinois the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services primarily for purchasers of the company s homes 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  overview throughout  and the first half of  the homebuilding environment continued to deteriorate against a backdrop of macroeconomic recession  declining consumer confidence and significant tightening in the availability of home mortgage credit 
while we have begun to see signs that some negative market trends may be moderating at both local and national levels  key macroeconomic indicators remain soft or mixed 
in addition  throughout  the credit markets and the mortgage industry have experienced a period of disruption characterized by bankruptcy  financial institution failure  consolidation and an unprecedented level of intervention by the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  it has made it more difficult for homebuyers to obtain acceptable financing 
although the supply of new and resale homes in the marketplace has decreased recently  it is still excessive for the current level of consumer demand and is challenged by an increased number of foreclosed homes offered at substantially reduced prices 
these pressures in the marketplace have resulted in price reductions in an effort to generate sales and reduce inventory levels by us and many of our competitors throughout much of we have responded to this challenging environment with a disciplined approach to the business with continued reductions in direct costs  overhead expenses and land spending 
we have limited our supply of unsold homes under construction and have focused on the generation of cash from our existing inventory supply as we strive to align our land supply and inventory levels to current expectations for home closings 
we continued to focus on the preservation of cash on hand and cash generation from the sale of existing inventory supply  including the introduction of additional sales incentives and reduced sales prices in certain situations in order to move this inventory 
we also reevaluated pricing in select communities in response to local market conditions to generate sales 
certain of these changes resulted in adjustments to our inventory valuations 
based on our evaluations during  we recorded inventory impairment charges of million  and million of option deposits and pre acquisition costs 
while these impairment charges and write offs are less than amounts recognized in each of the prior two years  they reflect the continued weakness in market conditions 
we will evaluate whether further impairment charges  valuation adjustments or write offs are necessary on these assets in the coming quarters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s inventory valuation adjustments 
in february  the  first time homebuyer tax credit was enacted into law 
this law enables homebuyers who have not owned a home in the past three years  subject to certain income limits  to receive a tax credit of of the purchase price of a home up to a maximum of  in november  this tax credit was extended by congress to june and the new law increased the annual income limits for qualification 
in addition  the new law also added a  tax credit for qualified existing homeowners who elect to purchase a new home 
certain states also enacted laws which enabled certain homebuyers to receive additional state tax credits 
although it is not possible to quantify the precise impact  availability of these tax credits appears to have incentivized certain homebuyers to purchase homes during the second half of in november  congress passed new net operating loss carry back legislation which extended the carryback period from two years to five years 
due to this new legislation  the company expects to receive a million refund in the first quarter of from carrying back net operating losses to our tax year  which has been recorded within benefit provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
outlook historically low interest rates  increased affordability and federal and state housing tax credits appear to have recently incented more prospective buyers to purchase a new home 
together with lower levels of competition from private builders  these factors offer evidence of improvement  though it is premature to conclude that a sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry is underway 
foreclosures continue to have significantly more damaging impact on the housing market than any other factor 
in most of our markets  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressure on all home sales and limit financing availability 
as a result  we continue to remain cautious regarding our outlook for the industry 
we believe that the timing of a sustainable recovery in the housing market remains unclear 
however  when economic conditions do improve  we believe that we have the right strategy and the right people to return to profitability 
with our increase in homes delivered in  increase in new contracts in  increase in backlog units and increase in the value of our backlog from  we believe that there is reason for guarded optimism 
based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing market  we believe that unexpected opportunities may arise in difficult times for those builders that are well prepared 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our balance sheet  liquidity  commitment to customer service  geographic presence  diversified product lines  experienced personnel  and brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
our desired financial targets for the new communities that we will offer in are gross margins  sales pace of per month  and a return on investment 
we are projecting to purchase approximately million of land in  compared to the million of land purchased in the approximately increase in land purchases will be used to i develop a meaningful presence in each of our existing markets with a goal of achieving economies of scale  which we believe will lead to greater future profitability  ii expand our geographic footprint  and iii manage our owned land inventory to an amount which we believe is prudent and manageable in light of our future sales expectations 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
we also had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately million available under the credit facility  along with an expected tax refund of million in the first quarter of we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of december  and cash generated from our operations during will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs throughout key financial results for the year ended december   total revenue decreased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is largely attributable to a decrease of million in revenue from outside land sales  from million in to million in revenue  however  was favorably impacted by a increase in homes delivered  from  in to  in  but this increase was partially offset by the decrease of the average sales price of homes delivered from  to loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million  from million in to million in during  the company incurred charges totaling million compared to million incurred in related to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs and abandoned land transaction costs 
excluding the charges related to the impairment of inventory  investment in unconsolidated llcs  and imported drywall charges  our adjusted operating gross margin was compared to s adjusted operating gross margin of  which also excludes charges related to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs 
excluding the impact of the above mentioned impairment and abandoned land transaction charges  as well as million of other non operating charges imported drywall charges of million  million of other unusual charges  including severance and bad debt expense  and loss on the sale of our airplane of million  the company recorded a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million in  which represents a million improvement from s pre tax loss from continuing operations of million exclusive of aforementioned impairments  million gain on the sale of the company s airplane  million of other unusual charges  including impairment of the company s airplane and bad debt expense  and million of severance 
please see the table set forth below which reconciles the non gaap financial measures of adjusted operating gross margin and adjusted pre tax loss from continuing operations to their respective most directly comparable gaap financial measures  gross margin and loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
the improvement from was primarily driven by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in land related expenses  including abandoned projects and deposit write offs  a decrease of million in payroll and incentive expenses  a decrease of million in miscellaneous expenses  including expenses related to the airplane that was sold in the first quarter of  and a decrease of million in professional fees 
additionally  selling expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a million decrease in expenses related to sales offices and model homes  a million decrease in variable selling expenses  and a million decrease in advertising expenses 
new contracts for were  up compared to  in for the year ended december   our cancellation rate was compared to in by region  our cancellation rates in versus were as follows midwest in and in  florida in and in  and mid atlantic in and in our mortgage company s capture rate increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from period to period 
we continue to deal with very weak and ever changing market conditions that require us to constantly monitor the value of our inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs in those markets in which we operate  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs and write off of abandoned land transaction costs  compared to million of charges during the year ended december  we generally believe that we will see a gradual improvement in market conditions over the long term 
in  we will continue to update our evaluation of the value of our inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs for impairment  and could be required to record additional impairment charges  which would negatively impact earnings should market conditions deteriorate further or results differ from management s original assumptions 
during  we accrued million for the repair of certain homes in florida where certain of our subcontractors had purchased imported drywall that may be responsible for accelerated corrosion of certain metals in the home 
during  we recorded a net tax benefit of million 
this net benefit consists primarily of the realization of million beginning of the year nol carryforwards which  due to recent tax legislation  we were allowed to carry back years 
in addition  as a result of a year carryback period available for certain of our losses  we were able to realize an additional million benefit 
we expect to receive the million in the first quarter of and the million in the fourth quarter of while our tax losses generated an additional million of deferred tax assets  we were required to fully reserve against such benefits as a result of our cumulative four year pre tax loss position 
the following table reconciles our operating gross margin and pre tax loss income from operations each of which constitutes a non gaap financial measure for the years ended december   and to the gaap financial measures of gross margin and loss from continuing operations before income taxes  respectively years ended gross margin add impairments imported drywall charges adjusted operating gross margin loss from continuing operations before income taxes add impairments and abandonments imported drywall charges other expense income restructuring other adjusted pre tax loss income from continuing operations adjusted operating gross margin  and adjusted pre tax income loss from operations are non gaap financial measures 
management finds these measures to be a useful in evaluating the company s performance because it discloses the financial results generated from homes it actually delivered during the period  as the asset impairments and certain other write offs relate  in part  to inventory that was not delivered during the period 
they assist the company s management in making strategic decisions regarding the company s future operations 
the company believes investors will also find these to be important and useful because it discloses profitability measures that can be compared to a prior period without regard to the variability of asset impairments and certain unusual write offs 
in addition  to the extent that the company s competitors provide similar information  disclosure of these measures helps readers of the company s financial statements compare profits to its competitors with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period 
in addition  because these measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the company s competitors due to potential differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded

seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in most years  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations  because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

interest 
interest expense for the company decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in interest capitalized  due primarily to a significant reduction in land development activities  and a slight increase in our weighted average borrowing rate  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview of capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
in light of the challenging homebuilding market conditions experienced over the past few years  we have been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows from operating activities through reductions in land inventories and other assets 
our housing inventories  including land investment  decreased by million  or  from billion at december   to million at december  the generation of cash flow from this reduction in assets has allowed us to increase our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet  and has placed us in a position to be able to invest in market opportunities as they arise 
we do not expect to generate as much cash from asset reductions in as we have in the past three years 
depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for such  we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our investment in inventories in anticipation of increasing our aggregate level of home sales in future years 
we are currently projecting to purchase approximately million of land in it is our intention  however  to maintain adequate liquidity and moderate leverage  while continuing to evaluate our overall capital structure  including re financing opportunities for our indebtedness 
at december   our ratio of net debt to total capital was  compared to at december  net debt to total capital consists of total debt net of cash divided by total debt plus shareholders equity 
the decrease in our ratio of net debt to total capital at december  as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to our higher cash balance resulting from generating cash flows from operations along with the equity offering we completed in the second quarter of  which netted million 
we believe that our balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market conditions 
however  future period end net debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the ratio achieved at december  we believe that the ratio of net debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our operations and comparing us with other homebuilders 
for comparison to our ratios of net debt to capital above  at december  and  our ratios of debt to total capital  without netting cash balances  were and  respectively 
historically  we had used our credit facility as a partial source of funding for our homebuilding operations 
however  as we have generated substantial cash flows from operations and accumulated a significant cash balance  we have not borrowed under the credit facility since december operating cash flow activities funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and the public debt and equity markets 
during  we generated million of cash from our operating activities  compared to million of cash from our operating activities in the million net cash generated during was primarily a result of million in cash generated by the conversion of inventory as a result of home closings and third party land sales  net of the amounts spent on land purchases  land development and home construction  along with a million increase in accounts payable  a million decrease in income tax receivable and a million decrease in cash held in escrow 
partially offsetting these cash sources was a net decrease in cash due to other operating activities  including a million decrease in other liabilities and a million decrease in accrued compensation 
we expect to receive a million federal tax refund during the first quarter of the amount of cash generated from operating activities in decreased million compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in cash generated by the conversion of inventory into cash as a result of home closings and third party land sales  net of amounts spent on land purchases  land development and home construction  along with a million decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans  and an million decrease in the change in cash held in escrow due to homes closing near the end of the year for which the cash was not collected until the beginning of partially offsetting the decrease in cash generated was a million increase in the change in accounts payable  compared to  from a decrease of million to an increase of million 
we had million in third party land sales in compared to million in the net cash provided by our operating activities during the past three years has resulted in substantial liquidity and provides us with the flexibility to determine the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and to take advantage of opportunities in the market 
while we have substantially slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land over the past three years  we are purchasing or contracting to purchase land and finished lots in many markets in an attempt to drive increased sales  home closings and profitability 
during this effort  we also plan to continue to manage our inventories by monitoring the aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold  completed homes in inventory 
as we work towards these goals  we expect to generate less cash flow from asset reductions in than we have over the past three years 
depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for such  we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our assets 
during we purchased million of land and lots  an increase of over s land purchases of million 
in light of our projected future volume and growth plans  in  we currently plan to purchase approximately million of land and spend an additional million on land development 
our land planned purchases are underwritten at a much higher rate of return than what we are receiving on our existing communities 
however  we will actively monitor market conditions and plan to adjust our spending accordingly  which may be up or down 
in the normal course of our business  we have continued to enter into land option agreements  taking into consideration current and projected market conditions  in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we have provided deposits to land sellers totaling million as of december  as consideration for the right to purchase land and lots in the future  including the right to purchase million of land and lots during the years through at december   we owned or controlled through options  home sites as compared to  at december  investing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we used million of cash in investing activities  primarily due to the addition of restricted cash  which had a balance at december  of million 
restricted cash primarily consists of homebuilding cash the company had designated as collateral at december  in accordance with the four secured letter of credit facilities loc facilities that the company entered into on july  of the million in restricted cash  million relates to collateral for the loc facilities  and million is restricted cash required to cover various other matters 
along with the increase in restricted cash  there was also an increase of million in property and equipment purchases 
partially offsetting these increases were the proceeds of million from the sale of our airplane 
financing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from financing activities 
in the second quarter of  we issued  common shares in a public offering  resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
offsetting the proceeds from this issuance were the repayments of million on our mif credit agreement  and million on a mortgage note for the company airplane which was sold in the first quarter of our homebuilding and financial services operations financing needs depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years  inventory levels and related turnover  forecasted land and lot purchases  and other company plans 
we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and  from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness  and may incur substantial indebtedness in the future  to fund our homebuilding activities 
we routinely monitor current operational requirements  financial market conditions  and credit relationships 
we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
however  we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are necessary if market conditions continue to deteriorate and extend beyond our expectations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future

our credit facility has key financial and other covenants  including requiring us to maintain tangible net worth minimum net worth of at least million plus of consolidated earnings without deduction for losses and excluding the effect of any decreases in any deferred tax valuation allowance earned for each completed fiscal quarter ending after december  to the date of determination  excluding any quarter in which the consolidated earnings are less than zero plus the amount of any reduction or reversal in deferred tax valuation allowance for each completed fiscal quarter ending after december   maintaining a leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth not in excess of to the leverage ratio  requiring adjusted cash flow from operations to consolidated interest incurred ratio the adjusted cash flow ratio to be greater than x  or requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash of more than million  prohibiting secured indebtedness  other than the credit facility and the mif credit agreement  but including the company s million guaranty of the mif credit agreement  from exceeding million  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced  less the lesser of of tangible net worth or prior six month sales times average book value of a finished lot  from exceeding of tangible net worth plus of the aggregate outstanding subordinated debt the total land restriction  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter from exceeding the greater of of the number of home closings within the twelve months ending on such date or of the number of unit closings within the six months ending on such date the spec and model homes restriction  limiting extension of credit on the sale of land to of tangible net worth and maintain maturity of five years  and limiting investment in joint ventures to of tangible net worth 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the credit facility 
the following table summarizes these covenant thresholds pursuant to the credit facility  and our compliance with such covenants financial covenant covenant requirements actual dollars in millions minimum net worth a leverage ratio b to to adjusted cash flow ratio c to to permitted debt based on borrowing base d total land restriction spec and model homes restriction a minimum net worth called actual consolidated tangible net worth in the credit agreement was calculated based on the stated amount of our consolidated equity less intangible assets of million as of december  b repayment guarantees are included in the definition of indebtedness for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio 
c if the adjusted cash flow ratio is below x  the company is required to maintain unrestricted cash in an amount not less than million 
d actual amount includes letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   the company s homebuilding operations did not have any outstanding borrowings  but had outstanding letters of credit totaling million under the credit facility  and we had pledged million of inventory to secure those outstanding letters of credit and any borrowings that we may make in the future under the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing amount of million 
under the terms of the credit facility  the million capacity includes a maximum amount of million in outstanding letters of credit 
borrowing availability is determined based on the lesser of credit facility loan capacity less credit facility borrowings including cash borrowings and letters of credit or the calculated maximum secured borrowing base cash plus qualified real property  less the actual borrowing 
as of december   net borrowing availability under the amended credit facility was million in accordance with the borrowing base calculation 
the company can create additional borrowing availability under the credit facility to the extent it collateralizes additional cash and or inventory assets 
the borrowing availability can also be increased by increasing investments in assets currently pledged but this is offset by the collateral value of homes delivered that are within the pledged asset pool 
borrowings under the credit facility are at the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from to basis points  or at the eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
the alternate base rate is defined as the higher of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus basis points or the one month eurodollar rate plus basis points 
our credit facility expires in october we expect to seek a replacement credit facility in connection with the expiration of our current credit facility 
based upon the current credit markets  we may be unable to replace the credit facility and if we are able to replace the credit facility  the terms of the new credit facility may not be as favorable as our current terms 
in either case  our business  liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
please see our risk factor if we are not able to obtain suitable financing our business may be negatively impacted in item a 
risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for more information regarding the risks surrounding the expiration of our credit facility 
however  we believe our balance of unrestricted cash  combined with our ability to generate additional cash flow from operating activities  provides us with sufficient liquidity for our operations in in july  the company entered into four secured letter of credit facilities loc facilities with a borrowing capacity of million and with maturities ranging from august  to august  for three of the loc facilities while the fourth loc facility remains in effect until the company gives notice of termination 
as of december   we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants 
there are also cross defaults to the credit facility discussed above  as well as collateral requirements which the company will cover solely with cash 
at december   there was million outstanding under the loc facilities which was collateralized with million of restricted cash 
we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment  and our ability to comply with our debt covenants may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond our control 
however  we believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with our balance of unrestricted cash  available borrowing options  and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending  and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months

at december   we had million of senior notes outstanding 
the notes are due april the credit facility prohibits the early repurchase of the senior notes 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the ability of the company to pay dividends on common and preferred shares  as well as the ability to repurchase any shares 
if our restricted payments basket  as defined in the indenture governing our senior notes  is less than zero  we are restricted from making certain payments  including dividends  as well as repurchasing any shares

for the year ended december  and  our weighted average borrowings outstanding were million and million  respectively  with a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the decrease in borrowings was primarily the result of the company using cash generated from operations to pay down outstanding debt 
preferred shares

dividends on the preferred shares are non cumulative and are paid at an annual rate of 
dividends are payable quarterly in arrears  if declared by us  on march  june  september and december if there is a change of control of the company and if the company s corporate credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded to a certain level together constituting a change of control event  the dividends on the preferred shares will increase to per year 
we may not redeem the preferred shares prior to march   except following the occurrence of a change of control event 
on or after march   we have the option to redeem the preferred shares in whole or in part at any time or from time to time  payable in cash of per depositary share 
the preferred shares have no stated maturity  are not subject to any sinking fund provisions  are not convertible into any other securities  and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us

the preferred shares are listed on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol mho pa 
we did not pay any dividends on the preferred shares in december  was the sixth dividend payment for which dividends on the preferred shares have not been paid 
as a result  the board of directors called a special meeting of the holders of the preferred shares as represented by the depositary shares for the purpose of nominating two persons to serve on the board of directors 
on january   the company held the special meeting of the holders of the preferred shares 
no preferred shares were represented in person or by properly executed proxy at the special meeting and  as a result  no persons were nominated to serve as directors

borrowings outstanding at december  had a weighted average interest rate of 
interest payments by period will be based upon the outstanding borrowings and the applicable interest rate s in effect 
the above amounts do not reflect interest 
b the company is party to a land purchase option agreement to acquire developed lots from a seller who is a variable interest entity 
the company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity  and therefore is required to consolidate the entity 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to consolidation of the variable interest entity 
the actual cash payments that the company will make in the future will be based upon the number of lots acquired each period under the option agreement and the related per lot prices in effect at that time 
c the company has obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin of  exclusive of impairment charges  less variable selling costs of of revenue  less costs already incurred on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
d the company has options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
e we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
as of december   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  including million of related accrued interest and million of related accrued penalties 
we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months 
however  the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable 
the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination of tax years through off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land  and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of unconsolidated llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing in the form of a capital distribution or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies  because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors  however  we must evaluate each entity to determine whether it is or is not a vie 
if an entity was determined to be a vie  we would then evaluate whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
we have determined that none of the unconsolidated llcs in which we have an interest are vies  and we also have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  therefore  our homebuilding unconsolidated llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million  plus letters of credit and bonds totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress  and our possible future obligations under guarantees and indemnifications provided in connection with these entities  as further discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under the option agreement often meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements is equal to the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including prepaid acquisition costs of million  and letters of credit of million 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
m i financial has also provided indemnifications to certain third party investors and insurers in lieu of repurchasing certain loans 
the risks associated with these guarantees and indemnities are offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  some of which were issued to various local governmental entities  that expire at various times through december included in this total are million of performance bonds and million of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress including the company s million share of our unconsolidated llcs letters of credit and bonds  million of financial letters of credit  and million of financial bonds 
the development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as houses are built and sold 
in locations where development has progressed  the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates and inflation 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
during the past few years  we have experienced some detrimental effect from inflation  particularly the inflation in the cost of land that occurred over the past several years 
as a result of declines in market conditions in most of our markets  in certain communities we have been unable to recover the cost of these higher land prices  resulting in lower gross margins and significant charges being recorded in our operating results due to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs  and other write offs relating to deposits and pre acquisition costs of abandoned land transactions 
in recent years  we have not experienced a detrimental effect from inflation in relation to our home construction costs  and we have been successful in reducing certain of these costs with our subcontractors 
however  unanticipated construction costs or a change in market conditions may occur during the period between the date sales contracts are entered into with customers and the delivery date of the related homes  resulting in lower gross profit margins
