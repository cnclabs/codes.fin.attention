item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form k under the captions risk factors  selected financial data  and business 
overview we are a leading developer  marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel  footwear and accessories 
the brand s moisture wicking synthetic fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products 
our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels  from youth to professional  on playing fields around the globe  as well as by consumers with active lifestyles 
our net revenues grew to million in from million in we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace relative to our competitors  as evidenced by the increases in our sales of apparel  footwear and accessories 
we plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel  footwear and accessories  expansion of our wholesale distribution  growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets 
our direct to consumer sales channel includes sales through our factory house outlet and specialty stores  website  and catalog 
new product offerings for included the introduction of performance running footwear and soccer cleats which had a limited introduction at soccer specialty stores in the united states and europe 
in addition  we have strategic agreements with third party licensees and distributors to further reinforce our brand identity and increase our net revenues 
our products are currently offered in over twenty thousand retail stores worldwide 
a large majority of our products are sold in north america  however we believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe 
internationally  our products are offered primarily in austria  france  germany  ireland and the united kingdom  as well as in japan through a third party licensee  and through distributors located in other foreign countries 
we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle 
we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products 
we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non performance products to our performance products  which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin  helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort 
we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states  but are occurring in a number of markets globally  thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers 
although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth  we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities  including  among others  the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and a more complex business 
we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products in a timely manner that meets changing preferences 
furthermore  our industry is very competitive  and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability 
we also rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers outside the us to provide fabrics and to produce our products  and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business

in conjunction with the termination of the prior revolving credit facility  we repaid the then outstanding balance of million

off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items 
generally  such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent  engage in willful misconduct  or act in bad faith 
based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities as well 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition net revenues consist of both net sales and license revenues 
net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership  including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods 
transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
in some instances  transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale eg at our factory house outlet and specialty stores 
we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
license revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees 
sales returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns  markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances  which is inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determined that actual or expected returns or allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase  as appropriate  to net sales in the period in which we made such a determination 
provisions for customer specific discounts based on contractual obligations with certain major customers are recorded as reductions to net sales 

table of contents reserves for returns  allowances  certain markdowns and certain discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices 
the majority of discounts earned by customers in the period are recorded as liabilities within accrued expenses as they stipulate settlements to be made through our cash disbursements 
in addition  certain markdowns expected to be paid to customers through cash disbursements are recorded as liabilities within accrued expenses 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a benefit or charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory valuation and reserves we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates our landed cost  using the first in  first out method of cost determination 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  we provide a reserve for such difference as a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by us  further adjustments may be required that would decrease or increase our cost of goods sold in the period in which we make such a determination 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated cash flows 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we review long lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
no material impairments were recorded in the years ended december    and income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of our management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions  or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements 
in addition  we recognize expense for stock based compensation awards granted prior to our initial filing of our s registration statement in accordance with accounting guidance that allows the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation expense of fixed stock options is based on the difference  if any  between the fair value of our stock on the grant date and the exercise price of the option 
we will continue to record stock based compensation expense for these awards until unearned compensation is fully amortized in as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense  excluding performance based stock options  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based compensation awards  stock price volatility and estimated forfeiture rates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  compensation expense for performance based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable  which requires management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
refer to note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
to date  net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant 
however  as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase  our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  if we recognize international revenues in local foreign currencies as we currently do in canada and europe and if the us dollar strengthens  it could have a negative impact on our international revenues upon translation of those results into the us dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements 
in 
table of contents addition  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our international subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies 
these gains and losses are primarily driven by inter company transactions 
these exposures are included in other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
since  we have used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inter company transactions and projected inventory purchases for our canadian subsidiary 
beginning in december  we began using foreign currency forward contracts in order to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on inter company transactions for our european subsidiary 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december   we receive us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of cad per and us dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of eur per 
as of december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month  and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded in other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note for a discussion of the fair value measurements 
other income expense  net included the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts year ended december  in thousands unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains losses realized foreign currency exchange rate gains losses unrealized derivative gains losses realized derivative losses although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows  we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
