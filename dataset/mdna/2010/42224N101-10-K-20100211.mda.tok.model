overview healthspring  inc the company or healthspring is a managed care organization whose primary focus is medicare  the federal government sponsored health insurance program for us citizens aged and older  qualifying disabled persons  and persons suffering from end stage renal disease 
as of december   we operated medicare advantage plans in alabama  florida  illinois  mississippi  tennessee  and texas 
as of january   we also commenced operations of medicare advantage plans in three counties in northern georgia 
we also offer a national stand alone medicare prescription drug plan 
we refer to our medicare advantage plans  including plans providing prescription drug benefits  or ma pd  as medicare advantage plans and our stand alone prescription drug plan as our pdp 
for purposes of additional analysis  the company provides membership and certain financial information  including premium revenue and medical expense  for our medicare advantage including ma pd and pdp plans 
we report our business in four segments medicare advantage  pdp  commercial  and corporate 
the following discussion of our results of operations includes a discussion of revenue and certain expenses by reportable segment 
see segment information below for additional information related thereto 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms is the federal agency responsible for overseeing the medicare program 
the company s tennessee medicare advantage plan is currently undergoing an audit by cms relating to compliance with cms s risk score coding requirements 
the company is in the process of responding to cms s information request  including retrieving and providing medical records that support diagnosis codes and risk scores relating to dates of service and plan premiums 
the company is currently unable to predict the outcome of cms s audit  calculate a payment error rate  or predict the amount of premiums  if any  that may be subject to repayment by the tennessee plan to cms 
no assurance can be provided at this time as to the outcome of the current cms audit or whether other company plans will be selected or targeted for such audits

revenue general 
our revenue consists primarily of i premium revenue we generate from our medicare line of business  ii fee revenue we receive for management and administrative services provided to independent physician associations  health plans  and self insured employers  and iii investment income 
premium revenue 
our medicare contracts entitle us to premium payments from cms on behalf of each medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans  generally on a per member per month  or pmpm  basis 
for our medicare plans  we recognize premium revenue during the month in which the company is obligated to provide services to an enrolled member 
premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as deferred revenue 
premiums for our medicare and commercial products are generally fixed by contract in advance of the period during which health care is covered 
each of our medicare plans submits rate proposals to cms  generally by county or service area  in june for each medicare product that will be offered beginning january of the subsequent year 
retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to each of our medicare plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan populations 
for a further explanation of the company s accounting for retroactive risk payments  see results of operations risk adjustment payments below 
as with our traditional medicare advantage plans  we provide written bids to cms for our part d plans  which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
premium payments from cms are based on these estimated costs 
the amount of cms payments relating to the part d standard coverage for our ma pd plans and pdp is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to cms to our actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or our refunding to cms a portion of the premium payments we previously received 
we estimate and recognize adjustments to premium revenue related to estimated risk corridor payments as of each quarter end based upon our actual prescription drug costs for each reporting period as if the annual contract were to end at the end of each reporting period 
we account for estimated risk corridor settlements with cms on our consolidated balance sheet and as an operating activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
actual risk corridor payments upon final settlement with cms could differ materially  favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates 
because of the part d product benefit design  the company incurs prescription drug costs unevenly throughout the year  resulting in fluctuations in quarterly ma pd and pdp earnings 
as a result of product features such as co payments and deductibles  the coverage gap  risk corridors  and reinsurance  we generally expect to incur a disproportionate amount of prescription drug costs in the first half of the year 
as a result  our part d related earnings are generally expected to increase in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year 

table of contents certain part d related payments we receive from cms  primarily relating to low income and reinsurance subsidies for qualifying members of our plans  represent payments for claims that we administer on behalf of cms and for which we assume no risk 
we account for these payments as funds held for or due for the benefit of members on our consolidated balance sheet and as a financing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these payments as these amounts represent pass through payments from cms to fund deductibles  co payments  and other member benefits 
fee revenue 
fee revenue primarily includes amounts paid to us for management services provided to independent physician associations and health plans 
our management subsidiaries typically generate fee revenue on one of two bases as a percentage of revenue collected by the relevant health plan  or as a fixed pmpm payment or percentage of revenue for members serviced by the relevant independent physician association  or ipa 
fee revenue is recognized in the month in which services are provided 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our management agreements with ipas  we receive fees based on a share of the profits of the ipas 
to the extent these fees relate to members of our hmo subsidiaries  the fees are recognized as a credit to medical expense 
management fees calculated based on profits are recognized  as fee revenue or as a credit to medical expenses  if applicable  when we can readily determine that such fees have been earned  which determination is typically made on a monthly basis 
investment income 
investment income consists primarily of interest income and gross realized gains and losses from sales of available for sale investments and discount amortization and interest on held to maturity securities 
medical expense our largest expense is the cost of medical services we arrange for our members  or medical expense 
medical expense for our medicare plans primarily consists of payments to physicians  hospitals  pharmacies  and other health care providers for services and products provided to our medicare members 
we generally pay our providers on one of three bases risk sharing arrangements  whereby we advance a capitated pmpm amount and share the risk of the medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre determined sharing ratios  capitated arrangements  generally on a fixed pmpm payment basis  whereby the provider generally assumes some or all of the medical expense risk  and fee for service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules 
pharmacy costs are recognized as incurred and represent payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers  if any 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective manufacturers 
one of our primary tools for managing our business and measuring our profitability is our medical loss ratio  or mlr  the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive 
small changes in the ratio of our medical expenses relative to the premium we receive can result in significant changes in our financial results 
changes in the mlr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicare funding  changes in benefits offered by our plans  our ability to manage medical expense  changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims  or ibnr  and our part d related earnings relative to cms risk corridors 
we use mlrs both to monitor our management of medical expenses and to make various business decisions  including what plans or benefits to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit  and our selection of healthcare providers 
we analyze and evaluate our medicare advantage and pdp mlrs separately 
acquisition of leon medical centers health plans on october   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of leon medical centers health plans  inc lmc health plans pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement  dated as of august  the stock purchase agreement 
the results of lmc health plans are included in our results from the date of acquisition 
lmc health plans is a miami  florida based medicare advantage hmo with approximately  members at december  up from approximately  members at the date of acquisition 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we acquired lmc health plans for million in cash and contingent consideration of  shares of healthspring common stock  which share consideration was released in november to the former stockholders of lmc health plans as a result of leon medical centers  inc lmc completing the construction of two additional medical centers in accordance with the timetable set forth in the purchase agreement 
the released shares are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of and as issued and outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we also recorded an additional purchase price of million in the fourth quarter associated with the release of such shares  which was recorded as goodwill 

table of contents as part of the transaction  we entered into an exclusive long term provider contract the leon medical services agreement with lmc 
lmc operates seven medicare only medical clinics located in miami dade county and has over a year history of providing medical care and customer service to the hispanic medicare eligible community of south florida 
the leon medical services agreement is for an initial term of approximately years with an additional five year renewal term at our option

our medicare advantage membership increased in each of our markets for and in the aggregate by to  members at december  from  members at december  the increase in was primarily the result of organic growth in our markets through increased penetration in existing service areas and to a lesser extent our expansion into additional service areas in the states where we operate 
our alabama and tennessee membership decreased slightly as of december  compared to membership at december  as a result of the company exiting certain counties and discontinuing and changing certain products 
effective as of january   we also began operating medicare advantage plans in three counties in northern georgia 
medicare advantage including ma pd membership as of january  was approximately  reflecting increases in each of our markets except texas whose membership decreased approximately  members 
pdp 
pdp membership increased by to  members at december  from  at december   primarily as a result of the auto assignment of members in the california and new york regions at the beginning of the year 
we do not actively market our pdp and primarily rely on cms auto assignments of dual eligible beneficiaries for membership 
once again  we retained auto assigned dual eligible pdp membership in of the cms pdp regions for although the regions changed 
pdp membership as of january  was approximately  commercial 
we had commercial members at december  our commercial hmo membership declined from  members at december  to members at december   primarily as a result of the non renewal of coverage by employer groups in tennessee  which was expected 
risk adjustment payments the company s medicare premium revenue is subject to adjustment based on the health risk of its members 
we refer to this process for adjusting premiums as the cms risk adjustment payment methodology 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 

table of contents the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given year generally occurs during the third quarter of such year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on updated diagnoses from the prior year 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for that year in the following calendar year the final cms settlement 
the impact of the company updating its estimated final cms settlement amounts in the following calendar year as a result of additional diagnoses code information and ultimately upon receiving notification of final cms settlement amounts were as follows resulting increase to premium medical net earnings per year ended december  revenue expense income diluted share million million million million million million million million million final cms settlement amounts for any given plan year should not be considered indicative of amounts to be received for any future plan year 
the following schedule includes premiums  medical costs  and medical loss ratio statistics as adjusted to reflect changes in estimates both for premium revenue and related risk sharing costs resulting from final cms settlements in the fiscal year which corresponds with the cms plan year for which the amounts pertain for example  adjustments to reflect in  premium amounts of million and the related risk sharing costs  which were recorded in  but pertain to the cms plan year

we believe that these non gaap measures are useful to investors and management in analyzing financial trends regarding our operating and financial performance 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the corresponding gaap as reported items shown in the table above 
reconciliation of part d activity with cms in october  the company received notification from cms that the company s obligation to cms for all part d activity for the plan year totaled million

segment information we report our business in four segments medicare advantage  stand alone prescription drug plan  commercial  and corporate 
medicare advantage ma pd consists of medicare eligible beneficiaries receiving healthcare benefits  including prescription drugs  through a coordinated care plan qualifying under part c and part d of the medicare program 
stand alone prescription drug plan pdp consists of medicare eligible beneficiaries receiving prescription drug benefits on a stand alone basis in accordance with medicare part d 
commercial consists of our commercial health plan business 
the commercial segment was insignificant as of december  and the corporate segment consists primarily of corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments 
these segment groupings are also consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in making operating decisions 
in connection with the company moving a large number of employees from its markets to its corporate operations effective january   the company revised its methodology for allocating certain corporate expenses to its segments  which resulted in its allocating a greater share of such expenses to its operating segments 
additionally  as of january   the company revised its methodology for allocating the sg a expenses within its prescription drug operations  which resulted in its allocating a greater share of such expenses to its ma pd segment 
as a result of these revisions  the segment ebitda amounts for the and periods include reclassification adjustments between segments such that the periods presented are comparable 
the results of each segment are measured and evaluated by earnings before interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and income taxes ebitda 
we do not allocate certain corporate overhead amounts classified as sg a expense or interest expense to our segments

table of contents statutory capital requirements the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain satisfactory minimum net worth requirements established by their respective state departments of insurance 
at december   the statutory minimum net worth requirements and actual statutory net worth  were million and million for the alabama hmo  million and million for the florida hmo  million and million for the tennessee hmo  and million at of authorized control level and million for the texas hmo  and million at of authorized control level and million for the accident and health subsidiary  respectively 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the state departments of insurance can require our regulated insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital in excess of amounts required under the applicable state law if they determine that maintaining additional statutory capital is in the best interest of our members 
in addition  as a condition to its approval of the lmc health plans acquisition  the florida office of insurance regulation has required the florida plan to maintain of the statutory surplus otherwise required by florida law until september effective july   we novated our pdp members and transferred the related assets and liabilities of the pdp business from the company s tennessee hmo subsidiary to our accident and health insurance subsidiary 
we obtained approvals for the transaction from cms  the tennessee department of commerce and insurance  and the texas department of insurance 
in connection with the novation  we were required to infuse million of capital into our accident and health subsidiary in the second quarter and agree to other financial measures relating to such subsidiary s net worth and capital in order to comply with various state regulatory requirements 
as a result of the novation and corresponding asset transfer  our tennessee hmo s statutory capital requirements will no longer be impacted by the pdp business segment s operating results and financial position 
the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions without appropriate regulatory notifications and approvals or to the extent such distributions would put them out of compliance with statutory net worth requirements 
at december   million of our million of cash  cash equivalents  investment securities  and restricted investments were held by our regulated insurance subsidiaries  and subject to these dividend restrictions 
subsidiary distributions to the parent company other than tax related distributions for   and were as follows year distributing subsidiary amount to parent in millions texas alabama texas alabama texas alabama in january  our texas hmo subsidiary distributed million to the parent company other than tax related distributions

table of contents in connection with funding the acquisition of lmc health plans  on october   we entered into agreements with respect to a million  five year credit facility the credit agreement which provided for million in term loans and a million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement accrued interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin basis points for libor advances at december  depending on our debt to ebitda leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rates incurred on borrowings under the credit agreement during the years ended december   and were and  respectively and  respectively  exclusive of amortization of deferred financing costs 
the credit agreement was scheduled to mature on october  the company made early principal payments of million and million in and  respectively 
in october  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements relating to the floating interest rate component of the term loan agreement under the credit agreement 
the total notional amount covered by the agreements was million of the million outstanding under the term loan agreement at december  under the swap agreements  the company was required to pay a fixed interest rate of and was entitled to receive libor every month until october  the interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges 
on february   the company entered into a million credit agreement the new credit agreement  which  subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein  provides for a five year  million term loan credit facility and a four year  million revolving credit facility  including a million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans the new credit facilities 
proceeds from the new credit facilities  together with cash on hand  were used to fund the repayment of million in term loans outstanding under the company s credit agreement as well as transaction expenses related thereto 
as of february   there was million of indebtedness outstanding under the new credit facilities 
borrowings under the new credit agreement accrue interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin depending on the company s debt to ebitda leverage ratio initially basis points for libor borrowings 
the company will also pay a commitment fee of per annum  which may be reduced to if certain leverage ratios are achieved  on the actual daily unused portions of the new credit facilities 
the revolving credit facility under the new credit agreement matures  the commitments thereunder terminate  and all amounts then outstanding thereunder will be payable on february  the term loans under the new credit agreement are payable in equal quarterly principal installments aggregating of the aggregate initial principal amount of the term loans in the first year  with the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loans being payable in equal quarterly installments aggregating    and in the second  third  fourth  and fifth years  respectively 
the net proceeds from certain asset sales  casualty condemnation events  and certain incurrences of indebtedness subject  in the cases of asset sales and casualty condemnation events  to certain reinvestment rights  and a portion of the net proceeds from equity issuances and  under certain circumstances  the company s excess cash flow  are required to be used to make prepayments in respect of loans outstanding under the new credit facilities 
the term loans made under the new credit agreement mature and all amounts then outstanding thereunder will be payable on february  loans under the new credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the company and its non hmo subsidiaries  including a pledge by the company and its non hmo subsidiaries of all of the equity interests in each of their domestic subsidiaries including hmo subsidiaries 

table of contents the new credit agreement contains conditions precedent to extensions of credit and representations  warranties  and covenants  including financial covenants  customary for transactions of this type 
financial covenants include i a maximum leverage ratio comparing total indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda  ii minimum net worth requirements for each hmo subsidiary calculated with reference to applicable regulatory requirements  and iii maximum capital expenditures  in each case as more specifically provided in the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement also contains customary events of default as well as restrictions on undertaking certain specified corporate actions including  among others  asset dispositions  acquisitions and other investments  dividends and stock repurchases  changes in control  issuance of capital stock  fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and consolidations  incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens  transactions with affiliates  and certain subsidiary regulatory restrictions 
if an event of default occurs that is not otherwise waived or cured  the lenders may terminate their obligations to make loans and other extensions of credit under the new credit agreement and the obligations of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit and may declare the loans outstanding under the new credit agreement to be due and payable 
the company believes it is currently in compliance with its financial and other covenants under the new credit agreement 
in connection with entering into the new credit agreement  the company wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately million incurred in connection with the credit agreement 
the company also terminated both interest rate swap agreements  which resulted in a payment of approximately million to the swap counterparties 
such amounts will be reflected in the financial results of the company for the quarter ending march  off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years credit agreement term loans interest revolving credit agreement medical claims operating lease obligations other contractual obligations total interest includes the estimated interest payments under our credit facility assuming no change in the libor rate applicable to the portion of our debt outstanding not subject to interest rate swap agreements as of december  amounts represent the annual commitment fee for the company s credit revolving agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded if and when better information becomes available 
actual results could significantly differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 

table of contents medical expense and medical claims liability medical expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical expense that has been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
medical expense includes claim payments  capitation payments  risk sharing payments and pharmacy costs  net of rebates  as well as estimates of future payments of claims incurred  net of reinsurance 
capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members 
pharmacy costs represent payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective vendors 
premiums we pay to reinsurers are reported as medical expense and related reinsurance recoveries are reported as deductions from medical expense 
medical claims liability includes medical claims reported to the plans but not yet paid as well as an actuarially determined estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
the following table presents the components of our medical claims liability as of the dates indicated december  in thousands incurred but not reported ibnr reported claims total medical claims liability the ibnr component of total medical claims liability is based on our historical claims data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics  and other related information 
estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  it represents our most critical accounting estimate 
the development of the ibnr includes the use of standard actuarial developmental methodologies  including completion factors and claims trends  which take into account the potential for adverse claims developments  and considers favorable and unfavorable prior period developments 
actual claims payments will differ  however  from our estimates 
a worsening or improvement of our claims trend or changes in completion factors from those that we assumed in estimating medical claims liabilities at december  would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 
as discussed above  actual claim payments will differ from our estimates 
the period between incurrence of the expense and payment is  as with most health insurance companies  relatively short  however  with over of claims typically paid within days of the month in which the claim is incurred 
although there is a risk of material variances in the amounts of estimated and actual claims  the variance is known quickly 
accordingly  we expect that substantially all of the estimated medical claims payable as of the end of any fiscal period whether a quarter or year end will be known and paid during the next fiscal period 
our policy is to record the best estimate of medical expense ibnr 
using actuarial models  we calculate a minimum amount and maximum amount of the ibnr component 
to most accurately determine the best estimate  our actuaries determine the point estimate within their minimum and maximum range by similar medical expense categories within lines of business 
the medical expense categories we use are in patient facility  outpatient facility  all professional expense  and pharmacy 
completion factors estimate liabilities for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid and takes into consideration factors such as expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  and membership changes 
the completion factor is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the total claims for services rendered for a given reporting period 
although the completion factor is generally reliable for older service periods  it is more volatile  and hence less reliable  for more recent periods given that the typical billing lag for services can range from a week to as much as days from the date of service 
our use of claims trend factors considers many aspects of the managed care business 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical expense trend and include the incidences of illness or disease state 
accordingly  we rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs  and growth of our members by type in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends  and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated as opposed to a fee for service basis 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes  and epidemics may impact medical expense trends 
other internal factors  such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical expense trends 
medical expense trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 

table of contents we apply different estimation methods depending on the month of service for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which account for the majority of the amount of ibnr  we estimate our claims incurred by applying the observed trend factors to the trailing twelve month pmpm costs 
for prior months  costs have been estimated using completion factors 
in order to estimate the pmpms for the most recent months  we validate our estimates of the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months using actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided  and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims liability estimates to be sufficient  taking into account an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
as such  we previously recognized in our medical claims liability a separate provision for adverse claims development  which was intended to account for moderately adverse conditions in claims payment patterns  historical trends  and environmental factors 
in periods prior to the fourth quarter of  we believed that a separate provision for adverse claims development was appropriate to cover additional unknown adverse claims not anticipated by the standard assumptions used to produce the ibnr estimates that were incurred prior to  but paid after  a period end 
when determining our estimate of ibnr at december   however  we determined that a separate provision for adverse claims development was no longer necessary  primarily as a result of the growth and stabilizing trends experienced in our medicare business  continued favorable development of prior period ibnr estimates  and the declining significance of our commercial line of business 
the completion and claims trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors that management believes are reasonably likely based on our historical experience and december  data completion factor a claims trend factor b increase increase decrease decrease increase in medical increase in medical decrease claims decrease claims in factor liability in factor liability dollars in thousands a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to estimates for a given reporting period 
accordingly  an increase in completion factor results in a decrease in the remaining estimated liability for medical claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trends used to estimate pmpm costs for the most recent three months 
each month  we re examine the previously established medical claims liability estimates based on actual claim submissions and other relevant changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with prior periods 
adjustments of prior period estimates will result in additional medical costs or  as we have experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
as reflected in the table below our reserve models developed favorably in   and and the accrued liabilities calculated from the models for each of the periods were more than our ultimate liabilities for unpaid claims 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical claims liability for the years ended december   and balance at beginning of period acquisition of lmc health plans incurred related to current period prior period total incurred paid related to current period prior period total paid balance at the end of the period approximately million paid to providers under risk sharing and capitation arrangements related to premiums is included in the incurred related to current period amounts in such amount does not relate to fee for service medical claims estimates 
similarly  million paid to providers under risk sharing and capitation arrangements related to premiums is included in the incurred related to current period 
most of these amounts are the result of additional retroactive risk adjustment premium payments recorded that pertain to the prior year s premiums see risk adjustment payments 
amounts in are presented in a consistent manner and are not significant 
negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior periods result from fee for service medical claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally anticipated a favorable development 
amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated claims liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled 
as discussed previously  medical claims liabilities are generally settled and paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider 
accordingly  the   and prior year favorable development relates primarily to fee for service claims incurred in previous calendar year 
the negative amounts reported in the table above for incurred related to prior periods result from fee for service claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally anticipated a favorable development 
a positive amount reported for incurred related to prior periods would result from claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts greater than originally anticipated an unfavorable development 
as reflected in the immediately preceding table  claims estimates at december  ultimately settled during for million or of total medical expense less than the amounts originally estimated 
this favorable prior period reserve development was primarily as a result of the following factors actual claims trends ultimately being lower than original estimates resulting in million of favorable development  primarily attributable to lower than anticipated cost increases and utilization in both our medicare and commercial lines of business  actual completion factors ultimately being higher than completion factors used to estimate ibnr at december  based on historical patterns resulting in million of favorable development  which increase was primarily attributable to a shortening of the time between when claims are submitted by providers and paid by our plans 
actual amounts ultimately owed for services and paid to providers in under risk sharing and quality care management initiatives being less than the related liabilities recorded at december  resulting in million of favorable development 

table of contents as reflected in the immediately preceding table  claims estimates at december  ultimately settled during for million or of total medical expense less than the amounts originally estimated 
this favorable prior period reserve development was primarily as a result of the following factors actual claims trends ultimately being lower than original estimates resulting in million of favorable development  primarily attributable to lower than anticipated cost increases and utilization in both our medicare and commercial lines of business  actual completion factors ultimately being higher than completion factors used to estimate ibnr at december  based on historical patterns resulting in million of favorable development  which increase was primarily attributable to a shortening of the time between when claims are submitted by providers and paid by our plans 
our medical claims liability also considers premium deficiency situations and evaluates the necessity for additional related liabilities 
there were no required premium deficiency accruals at december  or december  premium revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from cms to provide healthcare benefits to our members 
we receive premium payments on a pmpm basis from cms to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members  which premiums are fixed subject to retroactive risk adjustment on an annual basis by contracts with cms 
although the amount we receive from cms for each member is fixed  the amount varies among medicare plans according to  among other things  plan benefits  demographics  geographic location  age  gender  and the relative risk score of the member 
we generally receive premiums on a monthly basis in advance of providing services 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as deferred revenue 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
any amounts that have not been received are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable 
our medicare premium revenue is subject to periodic adjustment under what is referred to as cms s risk adjustment payment methodology based on the health risk of our members 
risk adjustment uses health status indicators to correlate the payments to the health acuity of the member  and consequently establishes incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  coordinated care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given fiscal year generally occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the prior year s dates of service 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for that fiscal year in the following year the final cms settlement 
we estimate and record on a monthly basis both the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement 
we develop our estimates for risk premium adjustment settlement utilizing historical experience and predictive actuarial models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our actuarial models are populated with available risk score data on our members 
risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year 
risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year  however  is not available for use in our models  therefore  we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this subset of our member population 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or the company receives notification from cms of such settlement amounts 

table of contents as a result of the variability of factors  including plan risk scores  that determine such estimations  the actual amount of cms s retroactive risk premium settlement adjustments could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and our accrual of settlement premiums related thereto  may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and  accordingly  our profitability 
there can be no assurances that any such differences will not have a material effect on any future quarterly or annual results of operations 
differences as a percent of total revenue between estimated final settlement amounts and actual final settlement amounts were notably less significant in the current year as compared to the prior year 
there can be no assurances  however  that any such differences will not have a material effect on any future quarterly or annual results of operations 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the final cms settlement and the impact on premium revenue caused by differences between actual and estimated settlement amounts that management believes are reasonably likely  based on our historical experience and december  data increase increase decrease decrease in settlement in estimate receivable dollars in thousands our risk adjustment payments are subject to review and audit by cms  which can potentially take several years to resolve completely 
any adjustment to premium revenue and the related medical expense for risk sharing arrangements with providers as a result of such review and audit would be recorded when estimable 
there can be no assurance that any retroactive adjustment to previously recorded revenue or expenses will not have a material effect on future results of operations 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of the excess 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and no longer depreciated 
our finite lived intangible assets primarily relate to acquired medicare member networks and provider contracts and are amortized over the estimated useful life  based upon the distribution of economic benefits realized from the asset 
this sometimes results in an accelerated method of amortization for member networks because the asset tends to dissipate at a more rapid rate in earlier periods 
other than member networks  our finite lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment under our long lived asset policy 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
goodwill exists at four of our reporting units alabama  florida  tennessee and texas 

table of contents goodwill valuations have been determined using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows of each reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we consider historical results  current operating trends and results  and we make estimates and assumptions about premiums  medical cost trends  margins and discount rates based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and regulatory data 
each of these factors contains inherent uncertainties and management exercises substantial judgment and discretion in evaluating and applying these factors 
although we believe we have sufficient current and historical information available to us to test for impairment  it is possible that actual cash flows could differ from the estimated cash flows used in our impairment tests 
we could also be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience various triggering events  including significant declines in margins or sustained and significant market capitalization declines 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future 
impairment charges  although non cash in nature  could adversely affect our financial results in the periods of such charges 
in addition  impairment charges may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future 
we conducted an annual impairment test as of october  and concluded that the carrying value of the reporting units did not exceed their fair value 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit tested exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
in addition  no events have occurred subsequent to the testing date which would indicate any impairment may have occurred 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  as applicable  based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we also have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
we accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
these amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
under the new guidance  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities 
the adoption of the new guidance on january  did not impact our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had the following assets that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates december  asset class in thousands investment securities  available for sale current portion non current portion investment securities  held to maturity current portion non current portion restricted investments we have not purchased any of our investments for trading purposes 
our investment securities classified as available for sale consist primarily of highly liquid government and corporate debt securities 
for all other investment securities  we intend to hold them to their maturity and classify them as current on our balance sheet if they mature on a date which is less than months from the balance sheet date and as long term if their maturity is more than one year from the balance sheet date 
these investment securities  both current and long term  consist of highly liquid government and corporate debt obligations  the majority of which mature in five years or less 
the investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of the relatively short term nature of our investments and our portfolio mix of variable and fixed rate investments  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
moreover  because of our intention not to sell these investments prior to their maturity  we would not expect foreseeable changes in interest rates to materially impair their carrying value 
restricted investments consist of deposits  certificates of deposit  government securities  and mortgage backed securities  deposited or pledged to state departments of insurance in accordance with state rules and regulations 
at december  and december   these restricted assets are recorded at amortized cost and classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date because of the restrictive nature of the states requirements 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately  similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments of approximately  unless we determined  however  that the increase in interest rates caused more than a temporary impairment in our investments  or unless we were compelled by a currently unforeseen reason to sell securities  such a change should not affect our future earnings or cash flows 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
at december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  bearing interest at variable rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or its libor rate  at our election 
borrowings under our new credit agreement will be similarly derived from floating interest rates 
although changes in the alternate base rate or the libor rate would affect the costs of funds borrowed in the future  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow would not be material 

table of contents at december   we had interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to these fluctuations 
the interest rate swaps converted a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a notional amount of million at december  and at an annual fixed rate of 
the notional amount of the swap agreements represents a balance used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and is not an asset or liability 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements was derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve 
in addition  the company incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non performance or credit risk and the counterparties non performance or credit risk in the fair value measurements 
we believe that credit risk under these swap arrangements was remote because the counterparties to the company s interest rate swap agreements were major financial institutions and the company did not anticipate non performance by the counterparties 
the company designated its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges which were recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps at december  are reflected as a liability of approximately million and are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
any market risk or opportunity associated with the swap agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
in connection with the new credit agreement  the interest rate swap agreements were terminated and approximately million was paid by us to the swap counterparties to settle the terminations 
as of december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million not subject to the interest rate swap agreements 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a increase in interest rates would have an estimated impact on pre tax earning and cash flows for the next twelve month period of  except for the aforementioned swap agreements  we have not taken any other action to cover interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities
