sales in north america our north american sales force is organized by product offerings and customer type 
our customers are served primarily through our reseller partners with a channel marketing organization assisting with lead generation and a channel support team responsible for partner training and support

as in north america  the majority of our ordering and fulfillment is handled by our distribution partners 
resellers and distributors substantially all of our sales come through our network of resellers  distributors and retailers 
our securityalliance global partner program is a global sales and marketing enablement program designed to meet the needs of our reseller partners in supporting end user customers

our top ten distributors represented to of net sales during  and our agreements with our distributors are not exclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
terminated distributors may 
table of contents not continue to sell our products 
if one of our significant distributors terminated its relationship with us  we could experience a significant disruption in the distribution of our products and a decline in our net revenue 
we use a sell through revenue recognition model for distributors  under which we recognize revenue at the time our distributors sell the products to their customers 
under this model  our distributors are permitted to purchase software licenses from us at the same time they fill customer orders and to pay for hardware and retail products only when they sell these products to their customers 
in addition  prior to selling our products to their customers  our distributors are permitted rights of return subject to varying limitations 
after a distributor sells a product to its customer  the distributor generally has no right to return the product to us  unless we approve the return from the final customer to the distributor 
strategic channel partners our channel efforts include strategic alliances with complementary manufacturers to expand our reach and scale 
oems and internet service providers isps license our products for resale to end users or inclusion with their products 
strategic channel partners include acer  inc  aol inc  at t  cable and wireless plc  dell  hewlett packard company  lenovo  sony corporation  telecom italia spa  toshiba america information systems  inc and telefonica sa  among others 
depending on the arrangement  oems may sell our software bundled with the pc or related services  pre install our software and allow us to complete the sale  or sublicense a single version of our products to end users who must register the product with us in order to receive updates 
strategic alliances from time to time  we enter into strategic alliances with third parties to produce innovative technology solutions and support our future growth plans 
these relationships may include joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and or sell through arrangements 
for example  in partnership with intel corporation intel  our endpoint encryption for pc product incorporates unique functionality taking advantage of intel s aes ni technology in their new westmere chipset to deliver increased  high speed security capabilities

our customers benefit from faster and less costly deployment and a partner ecosystem that delivers comprehensive solutions 
marketing activities our marketing approach involves a collaborative planning process to develop global marketing campaigns aligned to corporate goals and objectives 
global marketing campaigns drive awareness  demand generation and enablement for cross sell  up sell and net new customer acquisition activity in support of our business model across our major product lines  five regional theaters and three customer types 
one of the principal means of marketing our brand  products and services is online via the internet 
our web site  www 
mcafee 
com  supports marketing activities to our key customers and prospects  including home and home office users  small and medium sized businesses  large enterprises and our partner community 
our web site contains various marketing materials and information about our products 
our customers can download and purchase some products directly online 
we also promote the mcafee brand  our products and services through marketing activities in trade publications  direct mail campaigns  television  billboards and strategic arrangements  as well as  online through key word and search based advertising 
in we hosted c level executives in twelve countries to collaborate on our vision for security interlock and held our second annual focus user conference where customers  prospects and partners joined together to learn about security interlock and how to secure their business from the growing sophistication of targeted cyber attacks 
we attend trade shows and industry conferences  publish periodic channel and customer newsletters  and generate sales leads through email marketing campaigns 

table of contents we also market our products through the use of rebate programs and marketing development funds 
within most countries  we typically offer incentive rebates to channel partners based on sales and promotional rebates to end users 
we use channel marketing to market  promote  train and provide incentives to our resellers and distributors and to promote our offerings to their end user customers 
we offer our resellers and distributors technical and sales training classes  online training resources and sales and marketing demand generation assistance kits 
we also provide specific cooperative marketing programs for end user seminars  catalogs  demand creation programs  sales events and other items 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
we expect both product and pricing competitive pressures to increase in the near term as the industry continues to consolidate and our competitors grow rapidly through acquisitions 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  stronger relationships with strategic channel partners  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources and other market advantages 
increasingly  commoditized security protection is offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
potential customers may perceive our products as less valuable or even unnecessary if similar functionality is available at a significant discount or free 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in competition driven expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
see risk factors we face intense competition and we expect competitive pressures to increase in the future 
this competition could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our corporate products include  but are not limited to  the following performance  functionality and features  brand name recognition  breadth of product group  integration of products  time to market  price  the effectiveness of distributor promotion programs  sales and marketing efforts  quality of customer support and financial stability 
we believe that we generally compete favorably against our competitors in these areas 
however  lack of name recognition may be a concern with potential new customers 
competitor solutions may be more attractive than ours to the extent they are integrated with a larger product solution such as networking equipment and operating software 
in addition  our pricing may be less competitive  particularly compared to smaller competitors trying to enter the market 
our principal competitors in the corporate market are set forth below endpoint security market 
our principal competitors in this market are kaspersky lab zao  microsoft corp  panda security sl  sophos plc  symantec corp  and trend micro  inc network security market 
our principal competitors in the network security market are barracuda networks inc  blue coat systems  inc  check point software technologies ltd  cisco systems  inc  emc corp  fortinet  inc  international business machines  corp  juniper networks  inc  proofpoint  inc  symantec corp  trend micro  inc  sonicwall  inc  sourcefire  inc  websense  inc  and com corp 
risk and compliance market 
our principal competitors in the risk and compliance market are bigfix  inc  international business machines  corp  ncircle network security  inc  qualys  inc  symantec corp  and tripwire  inc security software as a service saas market 
our principal competitors in the saas market are google  inc  symantec corp  microsoft corp  and websense  inc other competitors 
in addition to competition from large technology companies such as cisco systems  inc  google  inc  international business machines  corp  microsoft corp  and symantec corp  we also face competition from smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 

table of contents in the consumer market  we believe that the principal competitive factors include  but are not limited to  the following brand name recognition and reputation  convenience of purchase  price  breadth of functionality and features  ease of use  and frequency of upgrades and updates 
we believe that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas 
however  if it is more convenient for consumers to use a competitive product for example  when they purchase computers that are prebundled with a competitor s product  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
our prices are also at a competitive disadvantage compared to free solutions or when competitors offer significant discounts 
our principal competitors are symantec corp 
with its norton product line  microsoft corp  kaspersky lab zao  avg technologies  trend micro  inc  alwil software avast  avira  f secure and ahnlab 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apac regions 
our proprietary technology our success depends to a great extent on our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights to our software 
we enforce our intellectual property rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices  and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and partners  and we enter into license agreements with our customers with respect to our software and other proprietary information 
however  the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary software technology may be inadequate to deter misuse or theft of this technology 
often  we do not obtain signed license agreements from customers who license products from us 
in these cases  we include an electronic version of an end user license in all of our electronically distributed software and a printed license with our products that are distributed in a box 
although this is common practice for software companies that sell off the shelf products to have licenses that are not signed by the licensee  certain legal authorities believe that such licenses may not be enforceable under the laws of many states and foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect these rights at all or offer only limited protection for these rights 
furthermore  we are aware that many users of our anti virus products have not paid any license or support fees to us 
see risk factors we face numerous risks relating to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights and our use of third party intellectual property  many of which could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights as well as other material adverse impacts on our business and financial results and condition below 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters and lower in our first and second quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and a large portion of our in period revenues are recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance 

table of contents our employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals worldwide  with approximately in the us less than of our employees are represented by a labor union or work council 
competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense in the software industry 
company information we were incorporated in the state of delaware in under the name of mcafee associates  inc in conjunction with our merger with network general corporation  we changed our name to networks associates  inc in  we changed our name to mcafee  inc

item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
some but not all of the risks we face are described below 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock 
adverse conditions in the national and global economies and financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial results 
national and global economies and financial markets have experienced a prolonged downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions impacted by the sub prime mortgage crisis  slower or receding economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  fluctuating energy costs  high unemployment  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and other factors 
the us and many other countries have been experiencing slowed or receding economic growth and disruptions in the financial markets 
the severity or length of time these economic and financial market conditions may persist is unknown 
during challenging economic times  periods of high unemployment and in tight credit markets  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  slower adoption of new technologies  lower renewal rates  and increased price competition 
these results may persist even if certain economic conditions improve 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have a more direct impact on our business 
any of these events would likely harm our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents we face intense competition and we expect competitive pressures to increase in the future 
this competition could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates  product placement fees  and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
advantages of larger competitors 
our principal competitors in each of our product categories are described in business competition above 
our competitors include some large enterprises such as microsoft  cisco systems  symantec  ibm and google 
large vendors of hardware or operating system software increasingly incorporate system and network security functionality into their products  and enhance that functionality either through internal development or through strategic alliances or acquisitions 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive international operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors  significantly greater product development and acquisition budgets  and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
consumer business competition 
more than of our revenue comes from our consumer business 
our growth of this business relies on direct sales and sales through relationships with isps such as aol  cox  verizon and at t and pc oems  such as acer  dell  sony computer  hewlett packard and toshiba 
as competition in this market increases  we have and will continue to experience pricing pressures that could have a negative effect on our ability to sustain our revenue  operating margin and market share growth 
as our consumer business becomes increasingly more dependent upon the partner model  our retail businesses may continue to decline 
further  as penetration of the consumer anti virus market through the isp model increases  we expect that pricing and competitive pressures in this market will become even more acute 
low priced or free competitive products 
security protection is increasingly being offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
the widespread inclusion of lower priced or free products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products or render our products unmarketable even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products 
it is possible that a major competitor may offer a free anti malware enterprise product 
purchasers of mini notebooks or netbooks  which generally are sold at a lower price than laptops  may place a greater emphasis on price in making their security purchasing decision as they did in making their computer purchasing decision 
the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies  shareware and freeware authors and open source projects that may develop competing products  as well as from future competitors  currently unknown to us  who may enter the markets because the barriers to entry are fairly low 
smaller and or newer companies often compete aggressively on price 
we face product development risks due to rapid changes in our industry 
failure to keep pace with these changes could harm our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological developments  continually evolving industry trends and standards and ongoing changes in customer requirements 
our success depends on our ability to timely and effectively keep pace with these developments 
keeping pace with industry changes 
we must enhance and expand our product offerings to reflect industry trends  new technologies and new operating environments as they become increasingly important to customer deployments 
for example  we must expand our offerings for virtual computer environments  we must continue to expand our security technologies for mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices such as mobile phones  personal digital assistants and smart phones  we must develop products that are compatible with new or otherwise emerging operating systems  while remaining compatible with popular operating systems such as linux  sun s solaris  unix  macintosh os x  and windows xp  nt  vista and  and we must continue to expand our business models beyond traditional software licensing and subscription models  specifically  software as a 
table of contents service is becoming an increasingly important method and business model for the delivery of applications 
we must also continuously work to ensure that our products meet changing industry certifications and standards 
failure to keep pace with any changes that are important to our customers could cause us to lose customers and could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
impact of product development delays or competitive announcements 
our ability to adapt to changes can be hampered by product development delays 
we may experience delays in product development as we have at times in the past 
complex products like ours may contain undetected errors or version compatibility problems  particularly when first released  which could delay or adversely impact market acceptance 
we may also experience delays or unforeseen costs associated with integrating products we acquire with products we develop because we may be unfamiliar with errors or compatibility issues of products we did not develop ourselves 
we may choose not to deliver a partially developed product  thereby increasing our development costs without a corresponding benefit 
this could negatively impact our business 
if our products do not work properly  we could experience negative publicity  damage to our reputation  legal liability  declining sales and increased expenses 
failure to protect against security breaches 
because of the complexity of our products  we have in the past found errors in versions of our products that were not detected before first introduced  or in new versions or enhancements  and we may find such errors in the future 
because of the complexity of the environments in which our products operate  our products may have errors or defects that customers identify after deployment 
failures  errors or defects in our products could result in security breaches or compliance violations for our customers  disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity  damage to our reputation  declining sales  increased expenses and customer relation issues 
such failures could also result in product liability damage claims against us by our customers  even though our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
furthermore  the correction of defects could divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
a major security breach at one of our customers that is attributable to or not preventable by our products could be very damaging to our business 
any actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  could adversely affect the market s perception of our security products and our stock price 
false alarms 
our system protection software products have in the past  and these products and our intrusion protection products may at times in the future  falsely detect viruses or computer threats that do not actually exist 
these false alarms  while typical in the security industry  would likely impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  we have in the past been subject to litigation claiming damages related to a false alarm  and similar claims may be made in the future 
our email and web solutions anti spam  anti spyware and safe search products may falsely identify emails  programs or web sites as unwanted spam  potentially unwanted programs or unsafe 
they may also fail to properly identify unwanted emails  programs or unsafe web sites  particularly because spam emails  spyware or malware are often designed to circumvent anti spam or spyware products and to incorrectly identify legitimate web sites as unsafe 
parties whose emails or programs are incorrectly blocked by our products  or whose web sites are incorrectly identified as unsafe or as utilizing phishing techniques  may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or unsafe and or for interfering with their businesses 
in addition  false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may discourage potential customers from using or continuing to use these products 
customer misuse of products 
our products may also not work properly if they are misused or abused by customers or non customer third parties who obtain access and use of our products 
these situations may arise where an organization uses our products in a manner that impacts their end users or employees privacy or where our products are misappropriated to censor private access to the internet 
any of these situations could impact the perceived reliability of our products  result in negative press coverage  negatively affect our reputation and adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
we may buy or make investments in complementary or competitive companies  products and technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in significant acquisition related charges and dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  we face a number of risks relating to our acquisitions  including the following  any of which could harm our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our past or future acquisitions 
integration 
integration of an acquired company or technology is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the successful integration of an acquisition requires  among other things  that we integrate and retain key management  sales  research and development and other personnel  integrate the acquired products into our product offerings from both an engineering and sales and marketing perspective  integrate and support pre existing suppliers  distribution and customer relationships  coordinate research and development efforts  and consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and integrate back office accounting  order processing and support functions 
if we do not successfully integrate an acquired company or technology  we may not achieve the anticipated revenue or cost reduction synergies 
the geographic distance between the companies  the complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired company or technology 
management s focus on the integration of operations may distract attention from our day to day business and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  it is common in the technology industry for aggressive competitors to attract customers and recruit key employees away from companies during the integration phase of an acquisition 
if integration of our acquired businesses or assets is not successful  we may experience adverse financial or competitive effects 
internal controls  policies and procedures 
acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards  controls  contracts  procedures and policies  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems 
acquisitions of privately held and or non us companies are particularly challenging because their prior practices in these areas may not meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and public accounting standards 
use of cash and securities 
our available cash and securities may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products 
moreover  when we acquire a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that may not be fully known at the time of acquisition 
to the extent we continue to make acquisitions  we will require additional cash and or shares of our common stock as payment 
the use of securities would cause dilution for our existing stockholders 
key employees from acquired companies may be difficult to retain and assimilate 
the success of many acquisitions depends to a great extent on our ability to retain key employees from the acquired company 
this can be challenging  particularly in the highly competitive market for technical personnel 
retaining key executives for the long term can also be difficult due to other opportunities available to them 
disputes that may arise out of earn outs  escrows and other arrangements related to an acquisition of a company in which a key employee was a principal may negatively affect the morale of the employee and make retaining the employee more difficult 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management members or other critical personnel that do not accept employment with mcafee following the acquisition 
in addition to retaining key employees  we must integrate them into our company  which can be difficult and costly 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of some unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
accounting charges 
acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses  amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
potential goodwill  intangible asset and purchased technology impairment 
we perform an impairment analysis on our goodwill balances on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  then we must write down goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we perform an impairment analysis on our intangible assets and purchased technologies whenever events 
table of contents occur that may indicate impairment 
if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the intangible asset or purchased technology is less than its carrying amount  then we must write down the intangible asset or purchased technology to its estimated fair value 
we cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business  changes in market conditions or a long term decline in the quoted market price of our stock will not result in an impairment of goodwill  intangible assets or purchased technologies and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods  which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
establishment of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
following an acquisition  we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue that we receive from the sale of products that we acquired  or from the sale of a bundle of products that includes products that we acquired  if we have not established vsoe for the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of acquired products or bundles that include acquired products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
similarly  companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures  which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
our international operations involve risks that could divert the time and attention of management  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial results 
our international operations increase our risks in several aspects of our business  including but not limited to risks relating to revenue  legal and compliance  currency exchange and interest rate  and general operating 
net revenue in our operating regions outside of north america represented of total net revenue in compared to in and in the risks associated with our continued focus on international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 
revenue risks 
revenue risks include  among others  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonality  currency fluctuations  and the high incidence of software piracy and fraud in some countries 
the primary product development risk to our revenue is our ability to deliver new products in a timely manner and to successfully localize our products for a significant number of international markets in different languages 
legal and compliance risks 
we face a variety of legal and compliance risks 
for example  international operations pose a compliance risk with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
some countries have a reputation for businesses to engage in prohibited practices with government officials to consummate transactions 
although we have implemented training along with policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with this and similar laws  there can be no assurance that all employees and third party intermediaries will comply with anti corruption laws 
any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
another legal risk is that some of our computer security solutions incorporate encryption technology that is governed by us export regulations 
the cost of compliance with those regulations can affect our ability to sell certain products in certain markets and could have a material adverse effect on our international revenue and expense 
if we  or our resellers  fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may become subject to penalties and fines or restrictions that may adversely affect our business 
increasingly  the united states congress congress is taking a more active interest in information and communications technology companies doing business in china and other countries whose governments pressure businesses to comply with domestic laws and policies in ways that may conflict with the internationally recognized human rights of freedom of expression and privacy 
congress has not prohibited companies from doing business in many of these countries  however  congress could change the export laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the sale of products in many of these countries  which could have a material adverse effect upon our international revenue 
other legal risks include international labor laws and our relationship with our employees and regional work councils  compliance with more stringent consumer protection and privacy laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and compliance with our code of conduct and other internal policies 

table of contents currency exchange and interest rate risks 
a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
we translate revenues and costs from these transactions into us dollars for reporting purposes 
as a result  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
this combined with economic instability  such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation  could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products  or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries 
during  we recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of million 
during and  we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of million and million  respectively 
we may be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates will impact our deferred revenue balance  which is a key financial metric at each period end 
general operating risks 
more general risks of international business operations include the increased costs of establishing  managing and coordinating the activities of geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations particularly sales and support and shared service centers located on multiple continents in a wide range of time zones 
we face a number of risks related to our product sales through distributors and other third parties 
we sell substantially all of our products through third party intermediaries such as distributors  value added resellers  pc oems  isps and other distribution channel partners referred to collectively as distributors 
reliance on third parties for distribution exposes us to a variety of risks  some of which are described below  that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
limited control over timing of product delivery 
we have limited control over the timing of the delivery of our products to customers by third party distributors 
we generally do not require our resellers and oem partners to meet minimum sales volumes  so their sales may vary significantly from period to period 
for example  the volume of our products shipped by our oem partners depends on the volume of computers shipped by the pc oems  which is outside of our control 
these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast our revenue accurately and they also can cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably 
competitive aspects of distributor relationships 
our distributors may sell other vendors products that compete with our products 
although we offer our distributors incentives to focus on sales of our products  they often give greater priority to products of our competitors  for a variety of reasons 
in order to maximize sales of our products rather than those of our competitors  we must effectively support these partners with  among other things  appropriate financial incentives to encourage them to invest in sales tools  such as online sales and technical training and product collateral needed to support their customers and prospects and technical expertise through local sales engineers 
if we do not properly support our partners  they may focus more on our competitors products  and their sales of our products would decline 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales through our oem partners that bundle our products with their products 
our reliance on this sales channel is significantly affected by our partners sales of new products into which our products are bundled 
our revenue from sales through our oem partners is affected by the number of personal computers on which our products are bundled and the rate at which consumers purchase or subscribe for the bundled products 
adverse developments in global economic conditions  competitive risks and other factors have adversely affected personal computer sales and if this trend continues  could continue to adversely affect our sales and financial results 
in addition  decreases in the rate at which consumers purchase or subscribe for our bundled products would adversely affect our sales and financial results 
for example  if our pc oem partners begin selling a greater percentage of netbooks and the conversion rate on netbooks is lower than the conversion rate on laptops  our sales would be adversely affected 
our pc oem partners are also in a position to exert competitive pricing pressure 
competition for oems business continues to increase  and it gives the oems leverage to demand lower product prices or other financial concessions from us in order to secure their business 
even if we negotiate what we believe are favorable pricing terms when we first establish a relationship with an oem  at the time of the renewal of the agreement  we may be 
table of contents required to renegotiate our agreement with them on less favorable terms 
lower net prices for our products would adversely impact our operating margins 
reliance on a small number of distributors 
a significant portion of our net revenue is attributable to a fairly small number of distributors 
our top ten distributors represented of our net revenue in  in and in reliance on a relatively small number of third parties for a significant portion of our distribution exposes us to significant risks to net revenue and net income if our relationship with one or more of our key distributors is terminated for any reason 
risk of loss of distributors 
we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our distributors  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
the agreements we have with our distributors can generally be terminated by either party without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if any significant distributor terminates its agreement with us  we could experience a significant interruption in the distribution of our products and our revenue could decline 
we could also lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the distributor relationship 
although a distributor can terminate its relationship with us for any reason  one factor that may lead to termination is a divergence of our business interests and those of our distributors and potential conflicts of interest 
for example  our acquisition activity has resulted in the termination of distributor relationships that no longer fit with the distributors business priorities 
future acquisition activity could cause similar termination of  or disruption in  our distributor relationships  which could adversely impact our revenue 
credit risk 
some of our distributors may experience financial difficulties  which could adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of december  we regularly review the collectability and credit worthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
our uncollectible accounts could exceed our current or future allowances  which could adversely impact our financial results 
other 
we also face legal and compliance risks with respect to our use of third party intermediaries operating outside the united states 
as described above in our international operations involve risks that could divert the time and attention of management  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial results  any violations by such third party intermediaries of fcpa or similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face numerous risks relating to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights and our use of third party intellectual property  many of which could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights as well as other material adverse impacts on our business and financial results and condition 
limited protection of our intellectual property rights against potential infringers 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technology 
however  the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technology may not deter its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products 
competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our proprietary technology 
we are aware that a number of users of our security products have not paid license  technical support  or subscription fees to us 
certain jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our software or lessened sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to refraining from intellectual property piracy or other infringements of intellectual property could also harm our business 
frequency  expense and risks of intellectual property litigation in the network and system security market 
litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights 
similarly  we may be required to defend against claimed infringement by others 
the security technology industry has increasingly been subject to patent and other intellectual property rights litigation  particularly from special purpose entities that seek to monetize their intellectual property rights by asserting claims against others 
we expect this trend to continue and that in the future as we become a larger and 
table of contents more profitable company  we can expect this trend to accelerate and that we will be required to defend against this type of litigation 
the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties  so we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position 
in addition to the expense and distraction associated with litigation  adverse determinations could cause us to lose our proprietary rights  prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  require us to obtain licenses to patents or other intellectual property rights that our products are alleged to infringe licenses may not be available on reasonable commercial terms or at all  and subject us to significant liabilities 
if we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology 
similarly  we face exposure to infringement actions if we hire software engineers who were previously employed by competitors and those employees inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of our competitors into our products despite efforts by our competitors and us to prevent such infringement 
litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights 
potential risks of using open source software 
like many other software companies  we use and distribute open source software in order to expedite development of new products 
open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses  including  for example  the gnu general public license 
these license terms may be ambiguous  in many instances have not been interpreted by the courts and could be interpreted in a manner that results in unanticipated obligations regarding our products 
depending upon how the open source software is deployed by our developers  we could be required to offer our products that use the open source software for no cost  or make available the source code for modifications or derivative works 
any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software 
our use of open source code could also result in us developing and selling products that infringe third party intellectual property rights 
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the code incorporates proprietary software 
we have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source 
however  we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
we also have processes and controls in place to review the use of open source in the products developed by companies that we acquire 
despite having conducted appropriate due diligence prior to completing the acquisition  products or technologies that we acquire may nonetheless include open source software that was not identified during the initial due diligence 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies of acquired companies that incorporate open source software or to otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may be restricted for the reasons described in the preceding two paragraphs 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been  and may be in the future  subject to other litigation including stockholder derivative actions or actions brought by current or former employees 
if we continue to make acquisitions in the future  we are more likely to be subject to acquisition related shareholder derivative actions and actions resulting from the use of earn outs  purchase price escrow holdbacks and other similar arrangements 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that an adverse liability resulting from such litigation is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention 
managing  defending and indemnity obligations related to these actions have caused significant diversion of management s and the board of directors time and resulted in material expense to us 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to certain currently pending legal matters 

table of contents our financial results can fluctuate significantly  making it difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results 
impact of fluctuations 
over the years our revenue  gross margins and operating results  which we disclose from time to time on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap and non gaap basis  have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and we expect this to continue in the future 
thus  our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
these fluctuations make it difficult for us to accurately forecast operating results 
we try to adjust expenses based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue  but in the short term expenses are relatively fixed 
this makes it difficult for us to adjust our expenses in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall in a given period 
volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
factors that may cause our revenue  gross margins and other operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  include  but are not limited to  the following establishment of vsoe 
we may in the future sell products in an arrangement for which we have not established vsoe for the undelivered elements in the arrangement and would be required to delay the recognition of revenue 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
timing of product orders 
a significant portion of our revenue in any quarter comes from previously deferred revenue  which is a somewhat predictable component of our quarterly revenue 
however  a meaningful part of revenue depends on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in the current quarter 
typically we generate the most orders in the last month of each quarter and significant new orders generally close at the end of the quarter 
some customers believe they can enhance their bargaining power by waiting until the end of our quarter to place their order 
personnel limitations and system processing constraints could adversely impact our ability to process the large number of orders that typically occur near the end of a quarter  which could adversely affect our results for the quarter 
any failure or delay in closing significant new orders in a given quarter also could have a material adverse impact on our results for that quarter 
reliability and timeliness of expense data 
we increasingly rely upon third party manufacturers to manufacture our hardware based products  therefore  our reliance on their ability to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information exposes us to risk  negatively impacting our ability to accurately and timely report our operating results 
issues relating to third party distribution  manufacturing and fulfillment relationships 
we rely heavily on third parties to manufacture and distribute our products 
any changes in the performance of these relationships can impact our operating results 
changes in our supply chain could result in product fulfillment delays that contribute to fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
we have in the past and may in the future make changes in our product delivery network  which may disrupt our ability to timely and efficiently meet our product delivery commitments  particularly at the end of a quarter 
as a result  we may experience increased costs in the short term as temporary delivery solutions are implemented to address unanticipated delays in product delivery 
in addition  product delivery delays may negatively impact our ability to recognize revenue if shipments are delayed at the end of a quarter 
product and geographic mix 
another source of fluctuations in our operating results and  in particular  gross profit margins  is the mix of products we sell and services we offer  as well as the mix of countries in which our products and services are sold  including the mix between corporate versus consumer products  hardware based compared to software based products  perpetual licenses versus subscription licenses  and maintenance and support services compared to consulting services or product revenue 
product and geographic mix can impact operating expenses as well as the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition  so our profitability can fluctuate significantly 

table of contents timing of new products and customers 
the timing of the introduction and adoption of new products  product upgrades or updates can have a significant impact on revenue from period to period 
for example  revenue tends to be higher in periods shortly after we introduce new products compared to periods without new products 
our revenue may decline after new product introductions by competitors 
in addition  the volume  size  and terms of new customer licenses can cause fluctuations in our revenue 
additional cash and non cash sources of fluctuations 
a number of other factors that are peripheral to our core business operations also contribute to variability in our operating results 
these include  but are not limited to  changes in foreign exchange rates particularly for the euro and the japanese yen and if international sales become a greater percentage of our total sales  repurchases under our stock repurchase program  expenses related to our acquisition and disposition activities  arrangements with minimum contractual commitments including royalty and distribution related agreements  stock based compensation expense  unanticipated costs associated with litigation or investigations  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  costs and charges related to certain extraordinary events such as restructurings  substantial declines in estimated values of long lived assets below the value at which they are reflected in our financial statements  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets or purchased technologies and changes in gaap  such as increased use of fair value measures  new guidance relating to gaap  such as the guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board in october on software revenue recognition and on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  changes in tax laws and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
material weaknesses in our internal control and financial reporting environment may impact the accuracy  completeness and timeliness of our external financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control and financial reporting environment 
if management identifies any material weaknesses  their correction could require remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
in addition  the presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which in turn could require us to restate our operating results 
this in turn could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could affect our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation 
our strategic alliances and our relationships with manufacturing partners expose us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
uncertainty of realizing anticipated benefit of strategic alliances 
we have entered into strategic alliances with numerous third parties to support our future growth plans 
for example  these relationships may include technology licensing  joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and sell through arrangements 
we face a number of risks relating to our strategic alliances  including those described below 
these risks may prevent us from realizing the desired benefits from our strategic alliances on a timely basis or at all  which could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
challenges relating to integrated products from strategic alliances 
strategic alliances require significant coordination between the parties involved  particularly if an alliance requires that we integrate their products with our products 
this could involve significant time and expenditure by our technical staff and the technical staff of our strategic partner 
the integration of products from different companies may be more difficult than we anticipate  and the risk of integration difficulties  incompatible products and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than that normally associated with new products 
the marketing and sale of products that result from strategic alliances might also be more difficult than that normally associated with new products 
sales and marketing personnel may require special training  as the new products may be more complex than our other products 
we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
generally  our strategic alliance agreements are terminable without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if 
table of contents we lose a significant strategic partner  we could lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the relationship 
in addition  we could be required to incur significant expenses to develop a new strategic alliance or to determine and implement an alternative plan to pursue the opportunity that we targeted with the former partner 
we rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture some of our hardware based network security and system protection products 
we expect the number of our hardware based products and our reliance on third party manufacturers to increase as we continue to expand these types of solutions 
we also rely on third parties to replicate and package our boxed software products 
this reliance on third parties involves a number of risks that could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
less control of the manufacturing process and outcome with third party manufacturing relationships 
our use of third party manufacturers results in a lack of control over the quality and timing of the manufacturing process  limited control over the cost of manufacturing  and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate manufacturing capacity 
risk of inadequate capacity with third party manufacturing relationships 
if any of our third party manufacturers fails for any reason to manufacture products of acceptable quality  in required volumes  and in a cost effective and timely manner  it could be costly as well as disruptive to product shipments 
we might be required to seek additional manufacturing capacity  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if additional capacity was available  the process of qualifying a new vendor could be lengthy and could cause significant delays in product shipments and could strain partner and customer relationships 
in addition  supply disruptions or cost increases could increase our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our financial performance 
our risk is relatively greater in situations where our hardware products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited number of third parties 
any significant shortage of components could lead to cancellations of customer orders or delays in placement of orders  which would adversely impact revenue 
risk of hardware obsolescence and excess inventory with third party manufacturing relationships 
hardware based products may face greater obsolescence risks than software products 
we could incur losses or other charges in disposing of obsolete hardware inventory 
in addition  to the extent that our third party manufacturers upgrade or otherwise alter their manufacturing processes  our hardware based products could face supply constraints or risks associated with the transition of hardware based products to new platforms 
this could increase the risk of losses or other charges associated with obsolete inventory 
we determine the quantities of our products that our third party manufacturers produce and we base these orders upon our expected demand for our products 
although we order products as close in time to the actual demand as we can  if actual demand is not what we project  we may accumulate excess inventory which may adversely affect our financial results 
our global operations may expose us to tax risk 
we are generally required to account for taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process may require us to make assumptions  interpretations and judgments with respect to the meaning and application of promulgated tax laws and related administrative and judicial interpretations 
the positions that we take and our interpretations of the tax laws may differ from the positions and interpretations of the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are presently under examination in many jurisdictions  including notably the us  california and germany 
an adverse outcome in one or more of these ongoing examinations  or in any future examinations that may occur  could have a significant negative impact on our cash position and net income 
although we have established reserves for these examination contingencies  there can be no assurance that the reserves will be sufficient to cover our ultimate liabilities 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and can be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  changes in tax laws and the related regulations and interpretations including various proposals currently under consideration  changes in accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions  and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in certain accounting guidance 
this guidance applies to all income tax 
table of contents positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 
critical personnel may be difficult to attract  assimilate and retain 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain senior management personnel  as well as technically qualified and highly skilled sales  consulting  technical  finance and marketing personnel 
other than members of executive management who have at will employment agreements  our employees are not typically subject to an employment agreement or non competition agreement 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to locate  replace and integrate any key management member or other critical personnel 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
other personnel related issues that we may encounter include competition for personnel  need for competitive pay packages 
competition for qualified individuals in our industry is intense and we must provide competitive compensation packages  including equity awards 
increases in shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans require stockholder approval  and there may be times  as we have seen in the past  where we may not obtain the necessary approval 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals  our ability to compete in the markets for our products could be adversely affected  which would have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
risks relating to senior management changes and new hires 
from to  we experienced significant changes in our senior management team as a number of officers resigned or were terminated and several key management positions were vacant for a significant period of time 
we may continue to experience changes in senior management going forward 
we continue to hire in key areas and have added a number of new employees in connection with our acquisitions 
for new employees  including senior management  there may be reduced levels of productivity as it takes time for new hires to be trained or otherwise assimilated into the company 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenue  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  service disruptions  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
we face risks related to customer outsourcing to system integrators 
some of our customers have outsourced the management of their information technology departments to large system integrators 
if this trend continues  our established customer relationships could be disrupted and our products could be displaced by alternative system and network security solutions offered by system integrators that do not bundle our solutions 
significant product displacements could negatively impact our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents if we fail to effectively upgrade or modify our information technology system  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded information technology systems and in applying maintenance patches to existing systems  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as personnel become familiar with new  upgraded or modified systems 
our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change  which could prolong the difficulties we experience with systems transitions  and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes 
if we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures  or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
we may also experience similar results if we have difficulty applying routine maintenance patches to existing systems in a timely manner 
computer hackers may damage our products  services and systems 
due to our high profile in the network and system protection market  we have been a target of computer hackers who have  among other things  created viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services  including our various web sites 
for example  we have seen the spread of viruses  or worms  that intentionally delete anti virus and firewall software 
similarly  hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services 
also  a number of web sites have been subject to denial of service attacks  where a web site is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the web site to overload  resulting in a delay or disruption of service 
if successful  any of these events could damage users or our own computer systems 
in addition  since we do not control disk duplication by distributors or our independent agents  media containing our software may be infected with viruses 
business interruptions may impede our operations and the operations of our customers 
we are continually updating or modifying our accounting and other internal and external facing business systems 
modifications of these types of systems are often disruptive to business and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to properly manage this process could materially harm our business operations 
in addition  we and our customers face a number of potential business interruption risks that are beyond our respective control 
natural disasters or other events could interrupt our business or the business of our customers  and each of us is reliant on external infrastructure that may be antiquated 
our corporate headquarters in california is located near a major earthquake fault 
the potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is not known  but could be quite severe 
despite business interruption and disaster recovery programs that have been implemented  an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
we are largely uninsured for losses and business disruptions caused by an earthquake and other natural disasters 
our investment portfolio is subject to volatility  losses and liquidity limitations 
continued negative conditions in the global credit markets could impair the value of or limit our access to our investments 
historically  investment income has been a significant component of our net income 
the ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
while our investment policy and strategy attempt to manage interest rate risk  limit credit risk  and only invest in what we view as very high quality debt securities  the outlook for our investment holdings is dependent on general economic conditions  interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace  which can all affect the income that we receive  the value of our investments  and our ability to sell them 
current economic conditions have had widespread negative effects on the financial markets and global economies 
during these challenging markets  we are investing new cash in instruments with short to medium term maturities of highly rated issuers  including us government guaranteed investments 
we do not hold any auction rate securities or structured investment vehicles 
the underlying collateral for certain of our 
table of contents mortgage backed and asset backed securities is comprised of some sub prime mortgages  as well as prime and alt a mortgages 
we are no longer purchasing mortgage backed or asset backed securities 
the outlook for our investment income is dependent on the amount of any acquisitions that we effect  the timing of our stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment 
our investment income is also affected by the yield on our investments and our recent shift to a larger percentage of our investment portfolio to shorter term and us government guaranteed investments 
this shift has negatively impacted our income from our investment portfolio in light of declining yields 
continued decline in our investment income or the value of our investments will have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to marketable securities 
during  we recorded additional impairment on previously impaired marketable securities totaling million 
we believe that our investment securities are carried at fair value 
however  over time the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value and the expected recoverability of certain securities which could change our judgment regarding impairment 
this could result in realized losses being charged against future income 
given the current market conditions involved  there is continuing risk additional impairments may be charged to income in future periods 
most of our cash and investments held outside the us are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a repatriation of these non us investment holdings to the non us under current law could be subject to foreign and us federal income and withholding taxes  less any applicable foreign tax credits 
local regulations and potential further capital market turmoil could limit our ability to utilize these offshore funds 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during and through february   our stock price was highly volatile  ranging from a high of to a low of 
on february   our stock s closing price was 
announcements  business developments  such as material acquisitions or dispositions  litigation developments and our ability to meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results  may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
in addition  third party announcements such as those made by our partners and competitors may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
for example  future announcements by major competitors related to consumer and corporate security solutions may contribute to future volatility in our stock price 
certain types of investors may choose not to invest in stocks with this level of stock price volatility 
our stock price may also experience volatility that is completely unrelated to our performance or that of the security industry 
for the past year  the major us and international stock markets have been extremely volatile 
fluctuations in these broad market indices can impact our stock price regardless of our performance 
our charter documents and delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover  which could lower our stock price 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and could have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the company or changes in management 
delaware law and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could also delay or make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us or changes in our board of directors and management more difficult 
for example  any stockholder wishing to make a stockholder proposal including director nominations at our annual meeting must meet the qualifications and follow the procedures specified under both the securities exchange act of and our bylaws 
in addition  we have a classified board of directors  however  our board of directors will be declassified over the three year period ending with our annual meeting of stockholders in

operating results and trends we evaluate our consolidated financial performance utilizing a variety of indicators 
five of the primary indicators that we utilize to evaluate the growth and health of our business are total net revenue  operating income  net income  net cash provided by operating activities and deferred revenue 
in addition  our management considers certain non gaap metrics derived by adjusts operating income and net income for certain items when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends 
these items include stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased technology and intangibles  acquisition related costs  restructuring charges benefits  legal settlement  in process research and development  investigation related and other costs  loss on sale disposal of assets and technology  change in fair value of stock based liability awards  impairment of marketable securities  income taxes and certain other items 
see the reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures below 
net revenue 
as discussed more fully below  our net revenue in grew by million  or  to  million from  million in our net revenue is directly impacted by corporate information technology  and government and consumer spending levels 
net revenue was positively impacted by million from our and acquisitions 
changes in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies negatively impacted our revenue growth by million in operating income 
operating income increased million in compared to as the increase in net revenue exceeded the increase in costs of net revenue and operating costs 
the increase in these expenses included i a million increase in salaries and benefits due to an increase in headcount  primarily as a result of our secure computing acquisition  ii a million increase in amortization expense as a result of purchased technology and intangibles in recent acquisitions  iii a million increase in stock based compensation expense associated with all stock based awards made to our employees and outside directors and iv a million increase in restructuring charges due to eliminating redundant positions from our secure computing acquisition and reorganization of our sales and marketing workforce 
the million increase in non gaap operating income which is adjusted for certain items excluded by management when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends in compared to resulted from a million increase in net revenue that exceeded the increase in costs of net revenue and operating expenses that was primarily related to a million increase in salaries and benefits 
see the reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures below 
net income 
the million increase in net income in compared to resulted from the increase in operating income described above and a million decrease in marketable security impairment charges  offset by a million decrease in interest and other income primarily attributable to lower yields and lower cash and marketable securities balances 
the million increase in non gaap net income which is adjusted for certain items excluded by management when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends in compared to resulted from the increase in operating income described above  offset by a million decrease in interest and other income primarily attributable to lower yields and lower cash and marketable securities balances 
see the reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures below 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities 
the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily attributable to management s focus on operating cash flows 
our working capital provided million in compared to using million in this resulted in a million increase in operating cash flows from working capital  primarily driven by improved collections of accounts receivable 
in addition  we had a million increase in non cash adjustments to net income  which included a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense and a million increase in deferred income taxes 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue balance at december  increased to  million  compared to  million at december  our deferred revenue continued to increase as a result of growing sales of maintenance renewals from our expanding customer base and increased sales of subscription based products 
we receive up front payments for maintenance and subscriptions  but we recognize revenue over the service or subscription term 
in addition  our deferred revenue balance was positively impacted as a result of i the weaker us dollar against the euro on december  compared to december  and ii acquired deferred revenue totaling million from our acquisitions in we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
approximately to of our total net revenue during both and came from prior period deferred revenue 
as with revenue  we believe that deferred revenue is a key indicator of the growth and health of our business 
acquisitions 
we continue to focus our efforts on building and enhancing a full line of system and network security solutions and technologies that support our multi platform strategy of personal computer  internet and mobile security solutions 
in  we acquired mx logic  for million and solidcore for million 
with the mx logic acquisition  we plan to deliver a comprehensive cloud based security portfolio 
with the solidcore acquisition  we plan to couple solidcore s whitelisting and compliance enforcement technology with our compliance mapping and policy auditing to deliver an end to end compliance solution 
in  we acquired secure computing for million 
with the secure computing acquisition  we deliver a complete network security solution to organizations of all sizes 
during  we acquired safeboot holding bv safeboot for million 
with this acquisition  we provide customers with endpoint and data security  including file and folder encryption 
we expect that the acquisitions of mx logic and solidcore will have a dilutive impact on net income in  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles 
we expect that the acquisitions of mx logic and solidcore will have a slightly accretive impact in when adjusting net income for certain items excluded by management when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends 
see the reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures below for such items excluded by management 
net revenue by product groups and customer category 
transactions from our corporate business include the sale of product offerings intended for enterprise  mid market and small business use 
net revenue from our corporate products increased million  or  to  million during from million in the year over year increase in revenue was due to a million increase in revenue from our network security offerings  which includes a million increase from our secure computing acquisition and a million increase from our mx logic acquisition  a million increase in revenue from our end point solutions offerings  a million increase in revenue primarily from our services offerings and a million increase in revenue from our vulnerability and risk management services 
in  we experienced an increase in the sale of our hardware solutions  which resulted in higher upfront revenue recognition 
during  we also experienced an increase in both the number and size of larger transactions sold to customers through a solution selling approach  which bundles multiple products and services into suite offerings 
this positively impacted revenue and deferred revenue and should continue to positively impact revenue in future periods 
during  net revenue from our corporate products increased million  or  to million from million in the year over year increase in revenue was due to a million increase in revenue from our end point solutions  which includes increased revenue from our system security solutions and new revenue from data encryption products integrated from our safeboot acquisition  a million increase in revenue from our network security offerings and an million increase in revenue from our vulnerability and risk management services 
transactions from our consumer business include the sale of product offerings primarily intended for consumer use  as well as any revenue or activities associated with providing an overall safe consumer 
table of contents experience on the internet or cellular networks 
net revenue from sales of our consumer products increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to i an increase in our online customer base  ii increased online renewal subscriptions from a larger customer base and iii increased up sell to higher level suites with higher price points 
we continue to strengthen our relationships with strategic channel partners  such as acer  dell  sony computer and toshiba 
during  net revenue from our consumer products increased million  or  to million from million in primarily due to i an increase in our customer base and ii increased percentage of suite sales from mcafee internet security suites to mcafee total protection suites 
foreign exchange fluctuations 
the euro and japanese yen are the two predominant non us currencies that affect our financial statements 
as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  our revenues from transactions outside the us and operating income may be negatively impacted 
as the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  our revenues may be positively impacted 
during  on an average quarterly exchange basis  the us dollar strengthened against the euro and weakened against the yen compared to overall  the us dollar strengthening against the euro had the most significant impact to our financial statements and this has resulted in a decrease in the revenue and expense amounts in certain foreign countries in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  income from operations and net income  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
to apply critical accounting policies we must evaluate a number of complex criteria and make significant accounting judgments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our significant accounting policies  which are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition we must make significant management judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue line item on our consolidated balance sheets and the net revenue line item on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our revenue  which is presented net of sales taxes  is derived primarily from two sources i service  support and subscription revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue as well as revenue from product licenses under subscription arrangements  and ii product revenue  which includes hardware and perpetual license revenue 
we apply software revenue recognition guidance to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware products that include software 
the application of this guidance requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe exists for these elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  including software licenses  maintenance and or services  we allocate and defer revenue equivalent to the vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as product revenue 
vsoe 
table of contents of fair value is based upon the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately or upon substantive renewal rates stated in a contract 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to our customers 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period generally as service  support and subscription revenue 
we apply software revenue recognition guidance to all transactions except those where no software is involved or software is incidental 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not separate the license fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
we enter into perpetual and subscription software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with partners  distributors and resellers 
we recognize revenue from the indirect sales channel upon sell through by the partner or distributor 
the license agreements generally include service and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
all revenue derived from our online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
professional services revenue is generally recognized as services are performed or if required  upon customer acceptance 
in these situations  we defer the direct costs of the subscription software licensing and professional services arrangements  and amortize those costs over the same period as the related revenue is recognized 
these costs are identified as cost of service  support and subscription revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements and the degree of flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
we also identify the direct and incremental costs associated with product revenues that have been deferred due to lack of vsoe on fair value on an undelivered element 
these costs are primarily hardware platform and other hardware component costs 
we defer these costs at the time of delivery and recognize them as cost of service  support and subscription revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  in proportion to the product revenue in services and support as it is recognized over the service period 
we reduce revenue for estimates of sales incentives and sales returns 
we offer sales incentives  including channel rebates  marketing funds and end user rebates for products in our corporate and consumer product lines 
additionally  end users may return our products  subject to varying limitations  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience 
in each accounting period  we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue 
these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and affect our accounts receivable  net  deferred revenue or other accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   our allowance for sales returns and incentives was million compared to million at december  if our allowance for sales returns and incentives were to increase by  or million  our net revenue would decrease by million and our deferred revenue would decrease by million for the year ended december  deferred costs of revenue and prepaid expenses we defer costs of revenue primarily related to revenue sharing and royalty arrangements and recognize these costs over the service period of the related revenue 
prepaid expenses consist primarily of revenue sharing costs that have been paid in advance of the anticipated renewal transactions and royalty costs paid in advance of revenue transactions 
we evaluate the remaining value of these prepaid expenses in comparison to estimates of future revenues 
our estimates of future revenue are based on assumptions considering our historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances 
we have not accelerated the expense of any material prepaid amounts for any periods presented in our statements of income and comprehensive income 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we record compensation expense for stock based awards issued to employees and outside directors in exchange for services provided based on the estimated fair value of the awards on their grant dates 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the required service or performance period of the awards 
our stock based awards include stock options options  rsus  rsas  psus and employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan espp grants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we use the black scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of our options and espp grants 
the black scholes pricing model requires estimates of the expected life of the option  as well as future volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
we derive the expected life of our options through a lattice model that factors in historical data on exercise and post vesting service termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we use the implied volatility of options traded on our stock with a term of one year or more to calculate the expected volatility of our option grants 
we have not declared any dividends on our stock in the past and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
the assumptions that we have made represent our management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if management had made different assumptions  our calculation of the options fair value and the resulting stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amounts recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we increased the assumption regarding our stock s volatility for options granted during by  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
likewise  if we increased our assumption of the expected lives of options granted during by one year  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million 
these notional increased expense amounts would be amortized over the options weighted average year vesting period 
in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our options  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all stock based awards and only recognize expense for those awards we expect to vest 
the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if we were to change our estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amount recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we had decreased our estimate of expected forfeitures by  our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  would have increased by million 
this decrease in our estimate of expected forfeitures would increase the amount of expense for all unvested awards that have not yet been recognized by million  amortized over a weighted average period of years 
estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation restructuring accrual 
to determine our restructuring charges and the corresponding liabilities  we make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we develop these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market in the respective locations as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
if  at december   our estimated sublease income were to decrease  the restructuring reserve and related expense would have increased by million 
the estimates regarding our restructuring accruals affect our other accrued liabilities and accrued taxes and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheets  since these liabilities will be settled each year through these estimates affect our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the restructuring charges benefits line item 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to litigation that is brought against us from time to time is based on claims for which our management can estimate the probability of an unfavorable 
table of contents outcome and the range of loss 
we recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss  as there is no better point of estimate 
due to the uncertainties related to an unfavorable outcome of litigation  and the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is often unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as litigation progresses  we continue to assess our potential liability and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
estimates of litigation liability affect our other accrued liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheets and our general and administrative expense line item on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
see note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess and make significant estimates regarding the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
estimates related to income taxes affect the deferred income taxes  other accrued liabilities and accrued taxes and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheets and our provision for income taxes line item in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our deferred tax asset is presented net of a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is recorded due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses of acquired companies 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical experience and estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the valuation allowance increased in  which included an increase of million related to recording valuation allowance on certain acquired net operating losses 
tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that adequate accruals have been made each period for unsettled issues  additional benefits or expenses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding matters 
we record additional expenses each period relating to the expected interest and penalties we would be required to pay a tax authority if we do not prevail 
we continue to assess our potential tax liability included in accrued taxes in the consolidated financial statements and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we have classified a portion of our tax liability as non current in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of cash payments to settle contingencies with taxing authorities 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  long lived assets and contingent consideration when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
we must also estimate the fair value of contingent consideration 
the allocation of the purchase price and valuation of contingent consideration requires management to make significant estimates in determining fair values  especially with respect to intangible assets and contingent consideration 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and relevant market and industry data 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate discount rate  the useful lives of intangible assets and probabilities of achievement of financial targets under contingent consideration arrangements 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

table of contents goodwill 
we make estimates regarding the fair value of our reporting units when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
we estimate cash flows for these purposes using internal financial projections based on recent and historical trends and relevant market and industry data 
we base these estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units 
if an impairment were present  these estimates would affect the impairment of marketable securities line item on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and would affect the goodwill line item in our consolidated balance sheets 
as goodwill is allocated to all of our reporting units  any impairment could potentially affect our operating geographies 
the fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective carrying amounts in our most recent goodwill impairment test 
intangibles and long lived assets 
we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many of the other factors  which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results 
contingent consideration 
our acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future financial measures or product development and integration milestones of an acquired company 
we make estimates regarding the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at the acquisition date and at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projection of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities subsequent to the acquisition are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  and could cause a material impact to our operating results 
impairment of marketable securities all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
we assess our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis for other than temporary impairment 
pursuant to accounting guidance effective april   if we have a security with a fair value less than its amortized cost and we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before it recovers  other than temporary impairment has occurred and we must record the entire amount of the impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before it recovers  we must estimate the net present value of cash flows expected to be collected 
if the amortized cost exceeds the net present value of cash flows  such excess is considered a credit loss and other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the residual portion of the other than temporary impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
we consider the likely reason for the decline in value  the period of time the fair value was below amortized cost  changes in and performance of the underlying collateral  the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations  changes in ratings and market trends and conditions 
prior to april   other than temporary impairment was recorded based on similar factors  as well as our intent and ability to hold until recovery of loss 
any decline deemed other than temporary was recognized in earnings 
we have not recorded any other than temporary impairment since april  in  we recorded other than temporary impairment of million 
in  we recorded other than temporary impairment of million  which consisted of million related to corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities that suffered significant declines in fair value  million related to a single corporate bond that had a significant decline in fair value due to the issuer s bankruptcy and million related to securities for which we did not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery due to our funding of the secure computing acquisition

dollars in thousands net revenue service  support and subscription product total net revenue net revenue by geography north america emea japan apac latin america total net revenue our net revenue in a specific period is an aggregation of thousands of transactions ranging from high volume  low dollar transactions to high dollar  multiple element transactions that are individually negotiated 
the impact of pricing and volume changes on revenue is complex as substantially all of our transactions contain multiple elements  primarily software licenses and post contract support 
additionally  approximately to of our revenue in a specific period is derived from prior period transactions for which revenue has been deferred and is being amortized into income over the period of the arrangement 
therefore  the impact of pricing and volume changes on revenue in a specific period results from transactions in multiple prior periods 
net revenue by geography net revenue outside of north america accounted for   and of net revenue for  and  respectively 
net revenue from north america and emea has historically comprised between and of our business 
the increase in net revenue in north america during was primarily related to i a million increase in corporate revenue and ii a million increase in consumer revenue 
the year over year increase in corporate revenue was due to a million increase in revenue from our network security offerings  which includes million increase from our secure computing acquisition and million from our mx logic acquisition  a million increase in revenue from our end point solutions offerings  a million increase in revenue primarily from our services offerings and a million increase in revenue from our vulnerability and risk management services

the increase in net revenue in north america during was primarily related to i a million increase in corporate revenue in north america due to increased revenue from our network security offerings  our end point solutions and our services offerings and ii a million increase in consumer revenue due to an increase in our customer base and increased percentage of suite sales from lower priced suites to higher priced suites 
corporate revenue was also impacted by an increase in us government spending on our product offerings and larger transactions sold to customers through a solution selling approach 
the increase in net revenue in emea during was attributable to revenue growth from both our consumer and corporate offerings  offset by the negative impact of the us dollar strengthening against the euro on an average exchange basis in compared to the year over year increase was primarily attributable to million increase from new revenue attributable to our secure computing acquisition and million in consumer revenue due to an increase in our customer base  offset by the negative foreign exchange impact of approximately million in compared to the increase in net revenue in emea during was attributable to i a million increase in corporate revenue due to increased revenue from our network security offerings  our end point solutions  and our vulnerability and risk management offerings and ii a million increase in consumer revenue due to an increase in our customer base  expansion to additional countries and an increased percentage of suite sales from lower priced suites to higher priced suites 
net revenue from emea was also positively impacted by the strengthening euro against the us dollar  which resulted in an approximate million impact to emea net revenue in compared to and is included in the corporate and consumer business increases above 
our japan  apac and latin america operations combined have historically comprised less than of our total net revenue and we expect this trend to continue 
in both and  net revenue in japan was positively impacted by the weakening us dollar against the japanese yen  which resulted in an approximate million and million contribution to japan net revenue in compared to and in compared to  respectively

in addition  revenue from consulting increased due to more consultants providing integration and implementation services 
although we expect our service  support and subscription revenue to continue to increase  our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of support arrangements as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenue and operating results would be adversely affected

the in process research and development included our firewall sidewinder  webwasher and mail products  and the fair value at acquisition was million  million and million  respectively 
the webwasher and mail products were completed in the firewall sidewinder product was complete as of december  the fair values were determined using the excess earnings method under the income approach using a discount rate reflective of the risk associated with the stage of completion and financial risk of the projects 
due to the implementation of new accounting guidance in  in process research and development is no longer immediately expensed upon closing of an acquisition

vs 
dollars in thousands interest and other income  net interest and other income includes interest earned on investments and interest expense related to our credit facility  as well as net foreign currency transaction gains or losses and net forward contract gains or losses

interest expense is primarily related to the interest and amortization of our debt issuance costs related to our million unsecured term loan and a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
interest expense was million in we had no interest expense in or we anticipate that interest and other income  net will decrease during as a result of lower cash balances due to acquisitions and our stock repurchase program  the declining interest rate environment  our shifting a large percentage of our investment portfolio to shorter term and us government and fdic guaranteed investments  which have a lower yield  and higher costs on our revised credit facility 

table of contents impairment of marketable securities during and  we recorded an expense for other than temporary impairments on certain of our marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
current economic conditions have had widespread negative effects on the markets for debt securities in and the and other than temporary impairments were recorded on certain of our asset backed and mortgage backed securities  which had significant declines in fair value  as well as one corporate debt security due to the issuer declaring bankruptcy 
we currently hold some asset backed and mortgage backed securities purchased in prior periods  but do not plan to acquire these types of securities in future periods 
pursuant to accounting guidance effective in the second quarter of  other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities is now based on our determination of whether the security will be sold prior to recovery or if our cost basis in the securities will be recovered 
further deterioration in the underlying collateral of our asset backed and collateralized mortgage securities could result in additional impairment charges  as will collectability issues on our corporate debt securities 
we did not have any impairments of securities in gain on sale of investments  net in  and  we recognized net gains on the sale of marketable securities of million  million and million  respectively 
our investments are classified as available for sale  and we may sell securities from time to time to move funds into investments with more lucrative yields for liquidity purposes or  in the case of  given the current economic environment  into investments that are considered more conservative  thus resulting in gains and losses on sale

the tax rate was unchanged from to as we had a tax benefit of a shift in jurisdictional earnings in and a benefit of the release of valuation allowance against income in higher tax jurisdictions in the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory rate due to the benefits of releasing valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits  research and development credits and lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
these benefits were partially offset by tax on deemed repatriations of earnings from foreign subsidiaries  the tax effects of stock compensation  and the expensing of million in process research and development related to the secure computing acquisition 
the decrease in the tax rate as compared to is primarily related to release of valuation allowance in offset by the tax effect of a shift in jurisdictional earnings 
the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory rate generally due to the benefits of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and valuation allowance adjustments 
these benefits are partially offset by adjustments to tax exposures  tax effects of stock compensation and deemed repatriations of earnings from foreign subsidiaries 
our future tax rates could be adversely affected if pretax earnings are proportionally less than amounts in prior years in countries where we have lower statutory rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations 
we 
table of contents cannot reasonably estimate the impact to our future effective tax rates for possible changes in earnings or tax laws and regulations 
the earnings from our foreign operations in india are subject to a tax holiday 
in august  the indian government extended the period through which the holiday would be effective to march  the tax holiday provides for zero percent taxation on certain classes of income and requires certain conditions to be met 
we were in compliance with these conditions as of december  the internal revenue service is presently conducting an examination of our federal income tax returns for the calendar years and we are also currently under examination by the state of california for the years to and in germany for the years to we cannot reasonably determine if these examinations will have a material impact on our financial statements 
we concluded pre filing discussions with the dutch tax authorities with respect to the tax year in january as a result  a tax benefit of approximately million is reflected in the first quarter in addition  the statue of limitations related to various domestic and foreign jurisdictions expired in  resulting in a tax benefit of approximately million 
reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures the following presentation includes non gaap measures 
our non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures

the sum of gaap net income per share and non gaap adjustments may not equal non gaap net income per share due to rounding differences 
the non gaap financial measures are non gaap operating income  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share diluted  which adjust for the following items stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased technology and intangibles  acquisition related costs  restructuring charges benefits  legal settlement  in process research and development  investigation related and other costs  loss on sale disposal of assets and technology  change in fair value of stock based liability awards  marketable securities impairment  net of accretion  income taxes and certain other items discussed below 
we believe that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is useful to investors  and such measures are used by our management  for the reasons associated with each of the adjusting items as described below stock based compensation expense consist of expense relating to stock based awards issued to employees and outside directors including stock options  restricted stock awards and units  restricted stock units with performance based vesting and our employee stock purchase plan 
because of varying available valuation methodologies  subjective assumptions and the variety of award types  we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies  and for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods 
in addition  we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of stock based compensation expense on our 
table of contents operating results 
the amounts in and excludes amounts paid to settle certain options held by terminated employees which expired as they could not be exercised during the day period subsequent to termination during the period from july through december   the date we became current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the amount in includes expense of million related to our tender offer that amended the exercise price on certain options 
amortization of purchased technology and intangibles are non cash charges that can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions 
we consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non gaap financial measures 
we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 
acquisition related costs include direct costs of the acquisition and expenses related to acquisition integration activities 
examples of costs directly related to an acquisition include transactions fees  due diligence costs  acquisition retention bonuses and severance  fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration  amounts or recoveries subject to escrow provisions  and certain legal costs related to acquired litigation 
these expenses vary significantly in size and amount and are disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because these charges are unique to specific acquisitions  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
restructuring charges benefits include excess facility and asset related restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy  such as acquisitions or divestitures 
these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 
in addition  our assumptions are continually evaluated  which may increase or reduce the charges in a specific period 
our management excludes these costs when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these charges when presenting non gaap financial measures 
legal settlements represent the cost of settlement for certain significant legal matters  including patent litigation 
our management excludes this charge when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting earnings trends  and therefore excludes this amount when presenting non gaap financial measures 
investigation related and other costs are charges related to discrete and unusual events where we have incurred significant costs which  in our view  are not incurred in the ordinary course of operations 
recent examples of such charges include legal expenses related to the special committee investigation into our past stock option granting practices which was completed in december our management excludes these costs when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these charges when presenting non gaap financial measures 
further  we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of these charges on our operating results 
loss on sale disposal of assets and technology relate to the sale or disposal of our assets 
these losses or gains can vary significantly in size and amount 
our management excludes these losses or gains when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these items when presenting non gaap financial measures 
in addition  in periods where we realize gains or incur losses on the sale of assets and or technology  we believe it is useful to investors to highlight the specific impact of these amounts on our operating results 
in process research and development constitute non cash charges that vary significantly in size and amount depending on the business combination and  therefore  are disregarded by our management when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends 
we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of these charges on our operating results 
acquired intangible asset expensed to research and development is related to the purchase of an intangible asset  which  similar to in process research and development costs  was expensed immediately 
our management excludes this cost when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes this cost when presenting non gaap financial measures 
further  we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of this cost on our operating results 
under accounting guidance effective in  such costs are no longer immediately expensed upon closing of an acquisition 

table of contents change in fair value of stock based liability awards constitutes the expense or benefit associated with the change in fair value of stock based liability awards at the end of the each reporting period 
our management excludes these benefits costs when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these amounts when presenting non gaap financial measures 
marketable securities impairment  net of accretion includes other than temporary declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities and subsequent recoveries of these losses when the securities are redeemed 
our management excludes these losses income when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these losses income when presenting non gaap financial measures 
provision for income taxes is our gaap provision that must be added back to gaap net income to reconcile to non gaap income before taxes 
non gaap provision for income taxes reflects a non gaap effective tax rate in and a non gaap effective tax rate in and which is used by our management to calculate non gaap net income 
management believes that the and effective tax rate in each respective period is reflective of a long term normalized tax rate under the global mcafee legal entity and operating structure as of the respective period end 
non gaap operating income the million increase in non gaap operating income in compared to was primarily attributable to the overall growth of the company  including a million increase in revenue  offset by a million increase in salaries and benefits  a million increase related to agreements with certain pc oem partners and increases in various other expenses 
non gaap net income the million increase in non gaap net income in compared to was primarily attributable to items discussed above under operating income offset by a million decrease in interest and other income primarily attributable to lower yields and lower cash and marketable securities balances  decreased foreign currency transaction gains  and increased interest expense associated with our credit facility

our principal uses of cash were operating costs  which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as other general operating expenses  partner and oem arrangements  acquisitions  and purchases of marketable securities 
during  we used million for the acquisitions of endeavor security  inc endeavor  solidcore and mx logic  net of cash acquired  and million for payment of a portion of the accrued purchase price for securify  inc  which we assumed in the acquisition of secure computing in we also used million for the net purchase of marketable securities  million for purchases of property and equipment and million to repurchase shares of common stock in connection with our obligation to holders of rsus  rsas and psus to withhold the number of shares required to satisfy the holders tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of such shares 
we classify our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in money market  us government fixed income  us government agency fixed income and investment grade corporate fixed income securities to maturity 
we currently hold some asset backed securities and cmo securities purchased in prior periods but do not plan to acquire these types of securities in future periods 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including holding investment securities of a short term and long term nature 
during the current challenging markets  we are investing new cash in instruments with short to medium term maturities of highly rated issuers  including us government and fdic guaranteed investments 
in december  we entered into a credit agreement by and among us  mcafee ireland holdings limited  certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors  the lenders from time to time party thereto and bank of america  na  as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million unsecured term loan and a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a million letter of credit sublimit 
the credit facility also contains an expansion option permitting us to arrange up to an aggregate of million in additional commitments from existing lenders and or new lenders at the lenders discretion 
we borrowed million under the term loan portion of the credit facility in january and paid the principal and accrued interest on our term loan in december we had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december  our management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions as a result of the recent distress in the financial markets 
as we monitor market conditions  our liquidity position and strategic initiatives  we may seek either short term or long term financing from external credit sources in addition to the credit facilities discussed herein 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including factors beyond our control  such as the current weakness in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and into which we sell our products  and increased uncertainty in the financial  capital and credit markets 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents our management plans to use our cash and cash equivalents for future operations  potential acquisitions and earn out payments related to current acquisitions 
we may in the future repurchase our common stock on the open market 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances and cash that we generate over time from operations  along with amounts available for borrowing under the credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and was primarily the result of our net income of million  million and million  respectively  net of non cash related expenses

our primary working capital use of cash was prepaid expenses  deferred costs of revenue and other assets primarily attributable to prepayments to our partners 
the amounts for changes in assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows reflect adjustments to exclude certain asset items that have not been paid in the current period 
during  our primary working capital source was increased deferred revenue  which was attributable to growing sales of maintenance renewals from our expanding customer base and increased sales of subscription based offerings 
working capital uses of cash included increased accounts receivable primarily due to increased invoicing over collections at the end of the year  increased prepaid expenses  deferred costs of revenue and other assets  and decreased accrued taxes and other liabilities primarily due to a tax settlement payment of approximately million 
in addition  during  payments to our partners for distribution related agreements were higher than in during  primary working capital sources were increases in deferred revenue  accrued taxes and other liabilities and accounts payable 
the increase in deferred revenue in was due to increased sales of subscription and support contracts 
the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to additional accruals for legal settlements 
primary working capital uses were increases in accounts receivable primarily attributable to increased invoicing over collections at the end of the year and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily attributable to prepayments to our partners 
our cash and marketable securities balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states

we utilize a variety of operational and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various agreements with minimum contractual commitments including telecom contracts  advertising  software licensing  royalty and distribution related agreements 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  borrowings under the credit facility  and internally generated funds 
we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
in addition  we currently cannot predict the outcome of the litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in in  the primary uses of cash in investing activities included million for acquisitions  million of net purchases of marketable securities and million for purchases of property and equipment

these shares were not part of the publicly announced repurchase program 
the primary source of cash provided by financing activities is proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp 
in  we received proceeds of million compared to million in and million in from issuance of stock under such plans 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp were significantly lower in as compared to and as employees were prohibited from exercising stock options until after we became current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  in december we had no repurchases of our common stock in the open market during and during  we used million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market  including commissions paid on these transactions 
as of december   we did not have authorization for repurchases of our common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions through december  depending upon market conditions  share price and other factors 
while we expect to continue to receive proceeds from our stock option plans and espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the type of equity awards granted to our employees  the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
credit facilities in december  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions credit facility 
the credit facility provided for a million unsecured term loan and a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a million letter of credit sublimit 
in february  we entered into an amendment to our credit facility

the loan bore interest at our election of an adjusted libor rate plus a margin 
the principal together with accrued interest were paid in december under the amendment to the credit facility  loans bear interest at our election at the prime rate or at an adjusted libor rate plus a margin ranging from to that varies with our consolidated leverage ratio a eurocurrency loan 
interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to prime rate loans and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of eurocurrency loans 
we may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments at any time  without premium or penalty  subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of eurocurrency loans 
no balances were outstanding under the credit facility as of december  and december  in addition  we have a million euro credit facility with a bank  the euro credit facility 
the euro credit facility is available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the euro credit facility will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction

paul  minnesota facility leases  million for the slough  united kingdom facility lease and million for the cork  ireland facility lease 
other commitments are minimum contractual commitments including distribution  telecom  software licensing and royalty agreements 
purchase obligations consist of purchase orders to our contract manufacturers and suppliers  based on our defined criteria  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply 
accrued taxes are tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur other than the amount included in the table above 
in addition to the contractual obligations above and as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
our maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that we believe will enable us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements or special purpose entities 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our functional currency is typically the currency of the local country 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe  latin america and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows or transact in foreign currencies for trading or other speculative purposes 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
to the extent that these estimates are incorrect  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with certain nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities  we enter into forward contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts typically range from one to three months in original maturity 
the forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked to market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as interest and other income 
during net realized losses arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts was million 
during and  net realized gains arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million and million  respectively 
forward contracts outstanding at december  are presented below in thousands december  notional us dollar asset liability equivalent fair value fair value euro british pound a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of december  indicated that a hypothetical and appreciation of the us dollar from its value at december  would decrease the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
a and depreciation of the us dollar from its value at december  would increase the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest rate risk we maintain balances in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we maintain our investment securities in portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities including money market  us government fixed income  us government agency fixed income and investment grade corporate fixed income securities 
we currently hold some asset backed and mortgage backed securities purchased in prior periods but do not plan to acquire these types of securities in future periods 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
during  there were significant disruptions in the financial markets 
a number of large financial institutions failed  were supported by the us government or were merged into other organizations 
the market disruption has resulted in a lack of liquidity in the credit markets and a decline in the market value of debt securities 
as a result of these effects  during we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to marketable securities 
in  we recorded additional other than temporary impairment on previously impaired marketable securities totaling million for continued declines in fair value 
of the million other than temporary impairment recorded in  million related to corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities  which suffered declines in fair value  million related to a single corporate bond that had a significant decline in fair value due to the issuer s bankruptcy and million related to impairment recorded because we no longer had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient for the fair values to recover due to funding our acquisition of secure computing  which was a one time event 
we had no other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in we had a net unrealized gain of million on marketable securities at december   compared with a net unrealized gain of million at december  the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over a twelve month time horizon
