the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the company 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies listed below are those that are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically the company has been able to return excess items to vendors for credit or sell such inventory to wholesalers 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets the company has a history of growth through acquisitions 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the carrying values of goodwill  customer list and trade name assets are subject to annual impairment reviews in accordance with accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company typically performs in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances affecting the company s business 
the company has one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the company s invested capital to the book value of its invested capital 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in the company s cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in the company s analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  as discussed above  in accordance with accounting guidance  the company is required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in the company s analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in the company s analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether the company s actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  the company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets even though realized actual cash flows are approximately equal to or greater than its previously forecasted amounts 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted 
for more complex reserve calculations  such as workers compensation  the company uses the services of an actuary on an annual basis to assist in determining the required reserve for open claims 
stock based compensation the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the terms and conditions of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the implied yield on zero coupon us treasury bonds with a remaining maturity equal to the expected term of the awards 
the company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes 
income taxes the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including the company s income  tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 
the company uses significant judgment and estimates in evaluating its tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense 
as a result  the tax rate reflected in the company s tax return the current or cash tax rate is different from the tax rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  while other differences are temporary as they reverse over time 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the tax reflected in the company consolidated financial statements and tax bases 
the company establishes valuation allowances when it believes it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at any one time  the company s tax returns for several tax years are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing jurisdictions 
the company establishes tax liabilities in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes 
the accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under the accounting guidance  the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
the company adjusts these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent the company s actual tax liability differs from its established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  the company believes that its tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
derivative financial instruments the guidance on derivatives and hedging instruments requires the company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company recognizes the fair value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized immediately in earnings unless certain accounting criteria established by the guidance are met 
these criteria demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and include an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact  if any  on the effectiveness of the derivative 
if these criteria are met  which the company must document and assess at inception and on an ongoing basis  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of all derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings 
the company primarily employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risk from interest rate changes and to limit the volatility and impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was partially due to a comparable store sales increase of 
the former craven and valley forge stores acquired in july and the former broad elm stores acquired in january are now included in comparable store sales numbers

comparable store traffic increased over the prior year as well 
soft economic conditions and the related decrease in consumer spending and tightening of credit  resulting in declining automobile sales as compared to historical levels  helped to contribute to the improved sales 
management believes that consumers are keeping their cars longer and repairing them instead of trading them in for new cars 
additionally  while consumers can and often defer repairs when the economy is weak  most repairs can only be deferred for a period of time 
when customers do come in to have their vehicles repaired  it is management s belief that they spend more on average because the problem with their vehicle has worsened due to additional wear 
management also believes that the recent closings of dealerships by chrysler and general motors are driving more business to the company s stores as consumers look for alternative  proven  economical and more geographically convenient locations to service their automobiles

the margin recognized in these transactions is typically less than the company s normal profit margin
