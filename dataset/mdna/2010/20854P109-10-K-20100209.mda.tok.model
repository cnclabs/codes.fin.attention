item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the us economy began growing in the third quarter of and continued growing in the fourth quarter 
due to the significant fiscal spending and relaxed monetary policy in the united states  a modest recovery appears likely to continue in the us through this should lead to an increase in demand for energy products from industrial customers  power generators and steel producers 
depending on the pace and sustainability of the recovery  we believe substantial opportunities exist for our metallurgical coal  thermal coal  and gas businesses 
steel plant capacity utilization rates in the us and globally continue to improve compared to last year 
domestic steel mills are using approximately of their capacity  while asian steel mills currently are using about of their capacity 
chinese steel demand is again driving world demand and pricing for coking coal 
through its arrangement with xcoal  consol expects to increase its sales to asian mills throughout going into the fourth quarter  thermal coal inventories were at historic highs 
because of the colder than normal weather in december and early january  inventories at coal fired power generators have been significantly drawn down  but are still somewhat higher than normal 
customers in our major market area the pjm power pool had an estimated days of inventory on hand as of mid january 
the company believes that thermal coal inventories could return to normal by mid year 
the outlook for a gradual economic recovery with strengthening demand and higher gas prices combined with the production declines over the past year are expected to tighten the thermal coal markets and support higher pricing 
higher gas prices in should result in power generators switching back from gas to coal based on dispatch economics 
we anticipate up to million tons of coal generation could displace natural gas generation in in addition  approximately gigawatts of new coal fired electricity generation capacity is set to come online by the end of this new demand  coupled with permanent cuts in coal production as well as safety and regulatory issues  is setting the stage for coal supply shortages over the next few years 
with the continued build out of scrubbers by generators  increased economic activity and its low cost position  consol energy is in a position to increase market share 
at the onset of the winter heating season  natural gas in storage fields was at record high levels 
because of much colder than normal weather in much of the us from mid december through mid january  gas in storage has been drawn down to normal levels 
the economic recovery is expected to positively affect industrial and commercial demand 
consol energy established an arrangement with xcoal to market consol energy coal in asia 
in january  we sold a vessel of high vol coking coal from bailey mine in northern appalachia to merchant coke plants in china 
this re branding of bailey mine coal from a premium thermal coal to a high volatile coking coal has meaningful implications for consol energy s earnings and beyond 
our goal in is to sell  tons of northern appalachia high volatile coking coal into asian markets 
in  a fish kill occurred in dunkard creek  which is a creek with segments in both pennsylvania and west virginia 
the fish kill was caused by the growth of golden brown algae in the creek  which appears to be an invasive species  not indigenous to the area 
a consol energy subsidiary discharges water into dunkard creek  after treatment  from its blacksville no 
mine and from its loveridge mine 
this water has levels of chlorides that are higher than west virginia in stream limits 
the subsidiary is subject to a state administrative order in west virginia that requires compliance in with effluent limits for chlorides for discharges from four active and two closed underground coal mines in northern west virginia 
given the volumes of water involved and the options that are available to timely meet the effluent limits  it is likely that it will be necessary to construct one or more treatment facilities using advanced water treatment technologies 
these requirements may cause consol energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders net income attributable to consol energy shareholders changed primarily due to the following items table in millions dollar variance percentage change sales outside sales purchased gas sales gas royalty interest freight outside other income total revenue and other income coal cost of goods sold and other charges purchased gas costs gas royalty interest costs total cost of goods sold freight expense selling  general and administrative expense depreciation  depletion and amortization interest expense taxes other than income black lung excise tax refund total costs earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest income tax expense earnings before noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest net income attributable to consol energy inc shareholders net income attributable to consol energy shareholders for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders for the year ended december  increased in comparison to the year ended december  primarily due to higher average thermal coal sales prices  higher gas sales volumes  and lower average cost per unit of gas sold 
improvements in net income attributable to consol energy shareholders were offset  in part  by the following items lower volume of thermal and metallurgical coal sold  lower average sales prices for gas volumes sold  lower average sales prices for metallurgical tons sold  higher average cost per ton of coal sold  
table of contents business interruption insurance settlement of million recognized in the year ended december  related to the buchanan roof collapse incident  and black lung excise tax refunds of million recognized in the year ended december  see discussion below for additional details of the changes in net income in the year to year comparison 
the cost per unit below is not necessarily indicative of unit costs in the future 
revenue revenue and other income decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal thermal produced coal metallurgical purchased coal produced gas industrial supplies other total sales outside gas royalty interest purchased gas freight revenue other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced thermal coal sales revenue during the year ended december  was due to the higher average price per ton sold  offset  in part  by lower sales volumes of company produced thermal coal sold 
variance percentage change produced thermal tons sold in millions average sales price per thermal ton the increase in average sales price in the year to year comparison primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in previous periods when there was a significant increase in the global demand for coal 
sales of company produced coal shipments decreased in the current period due to delivery deferments of central and northern appalachian coals 
coal consumption by the electric power sector continued to decline during the year 
in the year to year comparison of the thermal coal changes  the increased pricing improved sales income by million 
this was partially offset by lower thermal tons sold which reduced sales income by approximately million dollars 
the decrease in company produced metallurgical coal sales revenue during the year ended december  was due to the lower average price per ton sold and lower sales volumes of company produced metallurgical coal sold 
variance percentage change produced metallurgical tons sold in millions average sales price per metallurgical ton 
table of contents the decrease in average sales price for metallurgical coal in the year to year comparison reflects lower prices realized due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business and the deferment of previously negotiated pricing into future periods 
sales of company produced metallurgical coal decreased in the current period due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business resulting in reduced demand for metallurgical coal and the idling of the buchanan mine from march  to august  in the year to year comparison of metallurgical coal changes  the decreased pricing impaired sales income by million 
also  lower metallurgical tons sold impaired sales income by approximately million dollars 
purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
the decrease of million in purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to a decrease in demand in the year to year comparison  offset  in part  by higher sales prices 
the decrease of million in produced gas sales revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to lower average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold  offset  in part  by higher sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volume in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of the general market price decreases in the year to year comparison 
the general market price decline was offset  in part  by the various gas swap transactions entered into by cnx gas 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
in the year ended december   these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
the million decrease in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to lower sales volumes 
economic conditions had a negative impact on major customers  particularly those serving the auto and housing markets 
the million decrease in other sales was attributable to decreased revenues from barge towing and terminal services 
the decrease is related to lower tonnage moved by the barge towing and terminal services in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lower tonnage moved reflects the weak economic environment which has reduced the volume of products moved on the rivers in the year ended december  royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by cnx gas on their behalf 
the decrease in market prices  contractual differences among leases  and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet 
table of contents purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas  sold at market prices  that were purchased from third party producers 
variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
freight revenue has decreased million in primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom consol energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer 
freight revenue also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom consol energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes the cost to the customer 
other income consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income and miscellaneous income 
dollar variance percentage change business interruption proceeds gain on sale of assets contract towing proceeds from relinquishment of mining rights royalty income recognition of unrealized gains on options interest income equity in earnings of affiliates contract settlement other miscellaneous total other income in march  consol energy received notice from its insurance carriers that million would be paid as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the july buchanan mine incident that idled the mine 
the million represented business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income  the coal segment recognized million and the gas segment recognized million 
the final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to million  the maximum allowed per covered event 
gain on sale of assets decreased million in the year to year comparison due to including the sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer 
this transaction resulted in million pre tax gain in both periods also include various miscellaneous transactions  none of which were individually material 
contract towing revenue has decreased approximately million due primarily to the general slow down in the economy negatively impacting the volume of material being shipped via river transportation 
the year ended december  includes million of proceeds received from a third party in order for consol energy to relinquish the mining of certain in place coal reserves 
royalty income decreased million primarily due to lower volumes of consol energy coal produced by third parties 

table of contents in  mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses 
the reversal of losses was due to the options expiring during the year ended december  interest income increased million primarily due to higher average cash balances available to invest in the year to year comparison 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased million in the year ended december  due to various transactions entered into by our equity affiliates throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
in  million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage 
these customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to release them from the requirement of taking delivery of previously committed tons 
other miscellaneous income decreased million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
costs cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold and other charges outside gas royalty interest purchased gas total cost of goods sold produced coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes  offset  in part  by an increase in average unit cost per ton sold 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges per unit increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to an increase in average unit costs related to the following items in general  average cost of goods sold per unit has increased due to the reduced amount of tons sold from consol energy mines 
the reduction in tons sold reflects the weak economic environment which has affected electricity generation and correspondingly the demand for coal 
fixed costs incurred at our mining operations are now spread over fewer tons sold  which has negatively impacted average unit costs 
supply costs have increased per ton sold related to higher supply and maintenance costs at several locations 
additional supply and maintenance projects were related to additional preparation 
table of contents plant maintenance  additional belt advancement costs  additional mining equipment maintenance  additional roof support  additional use of contract labor to complete belt projects and additional water handling costs 
these increased supply and maintenance costs were offset  in part  by fewer seals being constructed in previously mined areas 
average unit costs of supplies were also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
labor costs have increased per ton sold due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines 
these contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract 
the average increase in unit cost for labor was also impacted by lower sales volumes due to the economic environment as discussed above 
united mine workers of america umwa health and retirement plan expenses have increased per ton sold primarily due to the effects of the labor contract that require additional contributions to be made into employee benefit funds 
the contribution increase over was per united mine worker of america hour worked 
the average increase in unit costs for health and retirement plans was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
subsidence cost increased per ton sold primarily due to the year ended december  including additional expenses related to work to be performed on streams that have been impacted by underground mining in pennsylvania 
the average increase in unit costs for subsidence was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
other costs per unit on a net basis have increased per ton sold due to various transactions that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by the following decrease contract mining fees decreased per ton sold due to lower contractor usage in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
the decrease of million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in was primarily due to lower volumes purchased 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased primarily due to a increase in volumes of produced gas sold  offset  in part  by lower average cost per unit sold 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet average costs per unit decreased in the year ended december  as a result of several factors well service costs have decreased by per thousand cubic feet due to lower contract service rig hours needed as a result of less pump maintenance being required in gob collection charges were per thousand cubic feet lower in the year to year comparison 
lower gob collection charges per unit were primarily due to the buchanan longwall being idled throughout some of compression expenses decreased per thousand cubic feet primarily due to a reduction in the number of compressors utilized in the northern appalachian production field 
due to the slow down in the drilling program in northern appalachia  rented compressors have been returned to more appropriately design the gathering fields for existing needs 

table of contents other costs have decreased per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the impact of additional volumes of gas sold during the year ended december  dollars spent remained consistent in the year to year comparisons  therefore additional volumes decreased the unit costs 
these decreases in unit costs were offset  in part  by the following idle drilling costs were per thousand cubic feet related to idling various drilling rigs throughout the company 
some of cnx gas drilling contracts require minimum payments be made to the contracting party when drilling rigs are not being used 
the cnx gas drilling program has been slowed down pending a change in the economic environment 
these charges resulted in an increase to costs 
firm transportation costs increased per thousand cubic feet primarily due to acquiring additional capacity in the northern appalachian region after december  power and fuel costs increased per thousand cubic feet due to a power rate increase which occurred after december  also  the increase was due to additional compressors being placed in service after december  along the existing gathering system in the central appalachian production field in order to flow the increasing gas volumes more efficiently 
industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased million primarily due to decreased sales volumes 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold increased approximately million in compared to approximately million of increased expenses were incurred at mine to pull underground equipment out of the mine in preparation of idling and to construct seals to close sections of the underground mine works so that the mine can be maintained in a more efficient manner 
increases were also attributable to the idled shoemaker mine incurring approximately million of additional expenses in the current period related to the continued maintenance of the mine in an idled status 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold also increased million primarily due to the periodic idling of various other locations throughout due to the economic environment 
these increases were offset  in part  by reductions of million related to mine closing  reclamation and water treatment liabilities 
these decreases primarily related to adjustments in engineering estimates of water quality and flows  as well as changes in the credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
other cost of goods sold remained consistent due to the following items dollar variance percentage change incentive compensation legal settlement cease use expense dry hole and other costs stock based compensation severance expense ward superfund site sales contract buyout profit splits buchanan roof collapse terminal river operations miscellaneous other other cost of goods sold and other charges the incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined production  safety and cost targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
incentive compensation expense increased million in due to exceeding the predetermined targets 

table of contents legal settlement of million represents the amount expensed for the settlement of the levisa action and the pobst combs action 
approximately million of cease use expense relates to the relocation of the consol energy and cnx gas corporate office and the cease use of the old facilities 
accordingly  a liability for the present value of the remaining lease payments for the previous corporate offices has been recognized in cost of goods sold and other charges and resulted in million of expense 
dry hole and other costs of million were incurred by the gas segment in the year ended december  dry hole and other costs were incurred in related to the determination that certain areas where an exploration well was drilled would not be economical to pursue 
the costs for the exploration well  which were previously capitalized  were expensed 
other costs include costs associated with certain leased property that will no longer be held due to the determination that the area would not be economical to pursue 
also  costs related to particular permits for areas where management has determined that no drilling will take place have been expensed 
stock based compensation expense increased million in the year to year comparison primarily due to million of fair value adjustments associated with the exchange offer to convert cnx gas performance share units into consol restricted stock units 
the year ended december  also includes additional expense due to expanding the stock based compensation program to include additional employees 
the year ended december  included a reduction to expense related to the cnx gas performance share units to reflect the lower market price of cnx gas shares at december  compared to its peer group 
the cnx gas performance share units were replaced with a consol energy restricted stock units in severance pay relates to the administrative staff reductions in force and resulted in million of expense in ward transformer superfund site expense was million lower in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the expense in each period represents consol energy s portion of the latest estimate of cost to remediate the site
