item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview of our financial model we are in one line of business the marketing of legal expense and other complimentary plans through a multi level marketing force to individuals and a direct sales force to employee groups 
our principal revenues are derived from membership fees  and to a much lesser extent  revenues from marketing associates 
our principal expenses are commissions  membership benefits  associate services and direct marketing costs and general and administrative expense 
the following table reflects the changes in these categories of revenues and expenses in the last three years dollar amounts in s caption change change change of from of from of from total prior total prior total prior revenues revenue year revenue year revenue year

the number of active memberships in force and the average monthly fee will directly determine membership fees and their impact on total revenues during any period 
the two most important variables affecting the number of active memberships during a period are the number of new memberships written during the period combined with the retention characteristics of both new and existing memberships 
see measures of member retention below for a discussion of our membership retention 
associate services revenues are a function of the number of new sales associates enrolled and the price of entry during the period  the number of associates subscribing to our eservice offering and the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force 
membership benefits expense is primarily determined by the number of active memberships and the per capita contractual rate that exists between us and our benefits providers 
during the last five years  it has been and is expected to continue to be a relatively consistent percentage of membership revenues of approximately 
commissions paid to associates are primarily dependent on the number and price of new memberships sold during a period and any special incentives that may be in place during the period 
we expense advance commissions ratably over the first month of the related membership 
the level of commission expense in relation to membership revenues varies depending on the level of new memberships written and is expected to be higher when we experience increases in new membership sales 
during the last five years this percentage has ranged from approximately to of membership revenues 
associate services and direct marketing expenses are directly impacted by the number of new associates enrolled during a period due to the cost of materials provided to such new associates  the number of associates subscribing to our eservice offering  the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force as well as the number of those associates who successfully meet the incentive award program qualifications 
general and administrative expenses are expected to trend up in terms of dollars  but remain relatively constant as a percent of membership fees 
during the past five years  general and administrative expenses have ranged from to of membership fees 
the primary benchmarks monitored by us throughout the various periods include the number of active memberships and their related retention characteristics  the number of new memberships written and the number of new associates enrolled 
our membership fees declined during  the first such decline in years 
even in each of the previous years before  the rate of growth has not been one we find acceptable 
we believe however  that our current product design  pricing parameters and business model are generally appropriate and we have no immediate plans to change these fundamental sectors 
instead of making changes to our basic product and business model  we believe changes must be made to our marketing methods to increase the exposure of our products and business opportunity 
we will consider an increased focus on benefit brokers  independent insurance agents and small businesses as well as considering additional methods of distribution such as an increased focus on internet based marketing efforts 
we will also consider increased incentives such as enhancements to our basic commission structure as well as increased use of performance bonuses 
should we implement additional commissions or bonuses  our marketing related expenses will be increased which may be partially or fully offset by increased membership fees 
our focus during will continue to be on improved training of our associates  enhancing the quality of sales tools provided to new and existing associates  providing incentives for associates to write consistent  quality business and continued emphasis on improving the basic retention characteristics of our memberships 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect  there could be a material change in our financial condition or operating results 
many of these critical accounting policies are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to our business and operations 
our critical accounting policies include estimates relating to revenue recognition related to membership and associate fees  deferral of membership and associate related costs  expense recognition related to commissions to associates  accrual of incentive awards payable and accounting for legal contingencies 
revenue recognition membership and associate fees our principal revenues are derived from membership fees  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
memberships are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of membership fees or upon written request 
membership fees are recognized in income ratably over the related service period in accordance with membership terms  which generally require the holder of the membership to remit fees on an annual  semi annual or monthly basis 
approximately of members remit their membership fees on a monthly basis 
the majority of our memberships that pay us via credit card or automatic bank draft pay us in advance 
at december   approximately of our legal service memberships and our idt memberships were paid in advance and  therefore  those payments are deferred and recognized over their respective periods 
at december   the deferred revenue associated with the membership fees was million  which is classified as a current liability 
we also charge new members  who are not part of an employee group  a enrollment fee 
this enrollment fee and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized in income over the estimated life of a membership in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc section  revenue recognition 
at december   the deferred revenue associated with the membership enrollment fees was million  of which million was classified as a current liability 
we compute the expected membership life using more than years of actuarial data as explained in more detail in measures of membership retention below 
at december   we computed the expected membership life to be approximately three years  which is unchanged from year end if the expected membership life were to change significantly  which we do not expect in the short term  the deferred membership enrollment fee and related costs would be recognized over a longer or shorter period 
we derive revenues from services provided to our marketing sales force including a one time non refundable enrollment fee from each new sales associate for which we provide initial sales and marketing supplies and enrollment services to the associate 
average enrollment fees paid by new sales associates were  and for  and  respectively 
revenue from  and costs of  the initial sales and marketing supplies approximately are recognized when the materials are delivered to the associates 
the remaining revenues and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized over the estimated average active service period of associates  which at december  is estimated to be approximately five months  which is unchanged from year end at december   the deferred revenue associated with sales associate enrollment fees was million  which is classified as a current liability 
we estimate the active service period of an associate periodically based on the average number of months an associate produces new memberships including those associates that fail to write any memberships 
if the active service period of associates changes significantly  which we do not expect in the short term  the deferred revenue and related costs would be recognized over the new estimated active service period 
member and associate costs deferred costs represent the incremental direct and origination costs we incur in enrolling new members and new associates related to the deferred revenue discussed above  and that portion of payments made to provider law firms million deferred at december  which is classified as a current asset and associates related to deferred membership revenue 
deferred costs for enrolling new members include the cost of the membership kit and salary and benefit costs for employees who process membership enrollments  and were million at december   of which million is classified in current assets 
deferred costs for enrolling new associates include training and success bonuses paid to individuals involved in recruiting the associate and salary and benefit costs of employees who process associate enrollments  and were  at december   and are classified as a current asset 
such costs are deferred to the extent of the lesser of actual costs incurred or the amount of the related fee charged for such services 
deferred costs are amortized to expense over the same period as the related deferred revenue as discussed above 
deferred costs that will be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as current and all remaining deferred costs are considered noncurrent 
associate related costs are reflected as associate services and direct marketing  and are expensed as incurred if not related to the deferred revenue discussed above 
these costs include providing materials and services to associates  associate introduction kits  associate incentive programs  group marketing and marketing services departments including costs of related travel  marketing events  leadership summits and international sales convention 
commissions to associates prior to march   our commission program provided for advance commission payments to associates of approximately of first year membership fees on new membership sales and commissions were earned by the associate at a rate of approximately in all subsequent years 
beginning with new memberships written after march   we implemented a level commission schedule of approximately per annum with up to a three year advance commission payment 
effective march   and in order to offer additional incentives for increased membership retention rates  we returned to a differential commission structure with rates of approximately of first year membership fees on new memberships written and variable renewal commission rates ranging from five to per annum based on the first month membership retention rate of the associate s personal sales and those of his organization 
beginning in august  we allowed the associate to choose between the level commission structure and up to a three year commission advance or the differential commission structure with a one year commission advance 
prior to january  we advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
in january  we implemented a policy whereby the associate received only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate met specified criteria 
for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate who met the specified criteria  advance commission payments were made at the time of sale of a new membership 
beginning april   we began advancing commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to up to one year commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is nine  the overall initial advance may be paid to approximately different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
the commission advance immediately increases an associate s unearned advance commission balance to us 
although prior to march   we advanced our sales associates up to three years commission when a membership was sold and subsequent to march   up to one year commission  the average commission advance paid to our sales associates as a group is actually less than the maximum amount possible because some associates choose to receive less than a full advance and we pay less than a full advance on some of our specialty products 
in addition  we may from time to time place associates on a less than full advance basis if there are problems with the quality of the business being submitted or other performance problems with an associate 
additionally  we do not advance commissions on certain categories of group business that have historically demonstrated below average retention characteristics 
in addition  any residual commissions due an associate defined as commission on an individual membership after the advance has been earned are retained to reduce any remaining unearned commission advance balances prior to being paid to that sales associate 
for those associates that have made at least personal sales  opened at least one group and personally write or more of their organizational business  of their commissions are set aside in individual reserve balance accounts  further reducing the amount of advance commissions 
the average commission advance paid as a percentage of the maximum advance possible pursuant to our commission structures was approximately  and during  and  respectively 
the commission cost per new membership sold has increased over the prior year by  and for  and  respectively  and varies depending on the compensation structure that is in place at the time a new membership is sold  the monthly membership fee of the membership sold and the amount of any charge backs recoupment of previous commission advances that are deducted from amounts that would otherwise be paid to the various sales associates that are compensated for the membership sale 
should we add additional products  such as the identity theft shield described above or add additional commissions to our compensation plan or reduce the amount of chargebacks collected from our associates  the commission cost per new membership will increase accordingly 
we expense advance commissions ratably over the first month of the related membership 
at december   advance commissions deferred were million and included as a current asset 
as a result of this accounting policy  our commission expenses are all recognized over the first month of a membership and there is no commission expense recognized for the same membership during the remainder of the advance period 
we track our unearned advance commission balances outstanding in order to ensure the advance commissions are recovered before any renewal commissions are paid and for internal purposes of analyzing our commission advance program 
while not recorded as an asset  unearned advance commission balances from associates for the following years ended december were caption amounts in s 
del beginning unearned advance commission balances    advance commissions  net of chargebacks and other    earned commissions applied    advance commission write offs    ending unearned advance commission balances before estimated unrecoverable balances estimated unrecoverable advance commission balances ending unearned advance commission balances  net del 
these amounts do not represent fair value  as they do not take into consideration timing of estimated recoveries 
the ending unearned advance commission balances  net  above includes net unearned advance commission balances of non vested associates of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as such  at december  future commissions and related expense will be reduced as unearned advance commission balances of million are recovered 
commissions are earned by the associate as membership fees are earned by us  usually on a monthly basis 
we reduce unearned advance commission balances or remit payments to associates  as appropriate  when commissions are earned 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  we  except as described below  generate an immediate charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture up to of any unearned advance on memberships written prior to march   and on any memberships written thereafter 
beginning in august  we allowed the associate to choose between the level commission structure and up to three year commission advance and up to chargebacks or the differential commission structure with a one year commission advance and up to chargebacks 
this charge back is deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
in order to encourage additional membership sales  we waived chargebacks for associates that met certain criteria in december and march  which effectively increased our commission expense 
any remaining unearned advance commission balance may be recovered by withholding future residual earned commissions due to an active associate on active memberships 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership are paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
we also have reduced chargebacks from to for certain senior marketing associates who have demonstrated the ability to maintain certain levels of sales over specified periods and maintain certain membership retention levels 
we may adjust chargebacks from time to time in the future in order to encourage certain production incentives 
we have the contractual right to require associates to repay unearned advance commission balances from sources other than earned commissions including cash a from all associates either i upon termination of the associate relationship  which includes but is not limited to when an associate becomes non vested or ii when it is ascertained that earned commissions are insufficient to repay the unearned advance commission payments and b upon demand  from agencies or associates who are parties to the associate agreements signed between october and july or july to august  respectively 
the sources  other than earned commissions  that may be available to recover associate unearned advance commission balances are potentially subject to limitation based on applicable state laws relating to creditors rights generally 
historically  we have not demanded repayments of the unearned advance commission balances from associates  including terminated associates  because collection efforts would likely increase costs and have the potential to disrupt our relationships with our sales associates 
this business decision by us has a significant effect on our cash flow by electing to defer collection of advance payments of which approximately million were not expected to be collected from future commissions at december  however  we regularly review the unearned advance commission balance status of associates and will exercise our right to require associates to repay advances when management believes that such action is appropriate 
non vested associates are those that are no longer vested because they fail to meet our established vesting requirements by selling at least three new memberships per quarter or retaining a personal membership 
non vested associates lose their right to any further commissions earned on memberships previously sold at the time they become non vested 
as a result  we have no continuing obligation to individually account to these associates as we do to active associates and are entitled to retain all commission earnings that would be otherwise payable to these terminated associates 
we do continue to reduce the unearned advance commission balances for commissions earned on active memberships previously sold by those associates 
substantially all individual non vested associate unearned advance commission balances were less than  and the average balance was at december  although the advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related membership  we assess  at the end of each quarter  on an associate by associate basis  the recoverability of each associate s unearned advanced commission balance by estimating the associate s future commissions to be earned on active memberships 
each active membership is assumed to lapse in accordance with our estimated future lapse rate  which is based on our actual historical membership retention experience as applied to each active membership s year of origin 
the lapse rate is based on our more than year history of membership retention rates  which is updated quarterly to reflect actual experience 
we also closely review current data for any trends that would affect the historical lapse rate 
the sum of all expected future commissions to be earned for each associate is then compared to that associate s unearned advance commission balance 
we estimate unrecoverable advance commission balances when expected future commissions to be earned on active memberships aggregated on an associate by associate basis are less than the unearned advance commission balance 
if an associate with an outstanding unearned advance commission balance has no active memberships  the unearned advance commission balance is written off but has no financial statement impact as advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related memberships 
refer to measures of member retention expected membership life  expected remaining membership life for a description of the method used by us to estimate future commission earnings 
further  our analysis of the recoverability of unearned advance commission balances is also based on the assumption that the associate does not write any new memberships 
we believe that this assessment methodology is highly conservative since our actual experience is that many associates do continue to sell new memberships and we  through our chargeback rights  gain an additional source to recover unearned advance commission balances 
changes in our estimates with respect to recoverability of unearned commissions could occur if the underlying membership persistency changes from historical levels 
should membership persistency decrease  the unearned commissions would be recovered over a longer period and the amount not recovered would most likely increase  although any increase in uncollectible unearned commissions would not have any immediate expense impact since the commission advances are expensed in the month they are incurred 
holding all other factors constant  the decline in persistency would also lead to lower membership fees  less net income and less cash flow from operations 
conversely  should persistency increase  the unearned commissions would be recovered more quickly  the amount unrecovered would decrease and  holding all other factors constant  we would enjoy higher membership fees  more net income and more cash flow from operations 
incentive awards payable associates can earn the right to attend an annual incentive trip by meeting monthly qualification requirements for the entire calendar year and maintaining certain personal retention rates for the memberships sold during the calendar year 
associates can also earn the right to receive additional monthly bonuses by meeting the monthly qualification requirements for twelve consecutive months and maintaining certain personal retention rates for the memberships sold during that twelve month period 
the incentive awards payable at any date is estimated based on an evaluation of the existing associates that have met the monthly qualifications  any changes to the monthly qualification requirements  the estimated cost for each incentive earned and the number of associates that have historically met the personal retention rates 
at december   the accrued amount payable was million 
changes to any of these assumptions would directly affect the amount accrued but we do not expect any of the significant trends affecting this account to change significantly in the near term 
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on our financial condition or results of operation 
the fasb asc section  contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
while the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not determinable  we do not currently anticipate that these contingencies will result in any material adverse effect to our financial condition or results of operation  unless an unexpected result occurs in one of the cases 
the costs of the defense of these various matters are reflected as a part of general and administrative expense  or membership benefits if fees relate to membership issues  in the consolidated statements of income 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses in all pending cases and will vigorously defend against the claims and have not established an accrued liability for any estimated damages in connection with these various cases 
however  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases or increased litigation costs could have an adverse effect upon our financial condition  operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
see legal proceedings 
other general matters operating ratios three principal operating measures monitored by us in addition to measures of membership retention are the membership benefits ratio  commission ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio 
the membership benefits ratio  the commissions ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio represent those costs as a percentage of membership fees 
we strive to maintain these ratios as low as possible while at the same time providing adequate incentive compensation to our sales associates and provider law firms 
these ratios do not measure total profitability because they do not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of memberships we generally advance significant commissions at the time a membership is sold 
since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a membership is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly membership fees are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the membership until all previous unearned advance commission balances have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership may be recovered over a multi year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new memberships written in relation to the existing active base of memberships and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such memberships 
investment policy our investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
our investment purchases consist of investment grade bonds primarily issued by corporations  the united states treasury  and state and municipal tax exempt bonds  certificates of deposit  auction rate securities and euro deposits 
we are required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states 
recently issued accounting pronouncements information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
measures of member retention one of the major factors affecting our profitability and cash flow is our ability to retain a membership  and therefore continue to receive fees  once it has been sold 
we monitor our overall membership persistency rate  as well as the retention rates with respect to memberships sold by individual associates and agents and retention rates with respect to memberships by year of issue  geographic region  utilization characteristics and payment method  and other sub groupings 
terminology the following terms are used in describing the various measures of retention o membership life is a period that commences on the day of initial enrollment of a member and continues until the individual s membership eventually terminates or lapses the terms terminate or lapse may be used interchangeably here 
o membership age means the time since the membership has been in effect 
o lapse rate means the percentage of memberships of a specified group of memberships that lapse in a specified time period 
o retention rate is the complement of a lapse rate  and means the percentage of memberships of a specified group that remain in force at the end of a specified time period 
o persistency and retention are used in a general context to mean the tendency for memberships to continue to remain in force  while the term persistency rate is a specific measure that is defined below 
o lapse rates  retention rates  persistency rates  and expected membership life may be referred to as measures of membership retention 
o expected membership life means the average number of years a new membership is expected to remain in force 
o blended rate when used in reference to any measure of member retention means a rate computed across a mix of memberships of various membership ages 
o expected remaining membership life means the number of additional years that an existing member is expected to continue to renew from a specific point in time based on the membership life 
variations in membership retention by sub groups  impact on aggregate numbers companywide measures of membership retention include data relating to members who can potentially be further sorted by identifiable sub groupings 
for example  memberships may be subdivided into those owned by members who are or are not sales associates  to those who are or are not members of group plans  etc 
measures of membership retention of different sub groups may vary 
for example  our experience indicates that first year retention rate of memberships owned by members who have accessed the services of the provider law firms historically have higher retention rates than those who have not 
they also likely have a better understanding and appreciation of the benefits of the membership  which may have contributed in fact to their decision to keep their membership active 
all aggregate measures of membership retention or expected life may be impacted by shifts in the underlying enrollment mix of sub groups that have different retention rates 
a shift in mix alone could  over time  cause an increase in reported aggregate retention measures and expected member life  even if the retention rates within each sub group do not change 
it is important to note that all blended rates discussed here may reflect the impact of such shifts in enrollment mixes

historically  we have observed that memberships in their first year have a significantly higher lapse rate than memberships in their second year  and so on 
the following chart shows the historical observed lapse rates and corresponding yearly retention rates as a function of membership age 
for example  of all new memberships lapse during the first year  leaving still in force at the end of the first year 
more tenured memberships have significantly lower lapse rates

del del 
membership persistency our membership persistency rate is a specific computation that measures the number of memberships in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i memberships in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new memberships sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   our annual membership persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
caption beginning new ending year memberships memberships total memberships persistency our overall membership persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total memberships in force  and shifts in the mix of members enrolled 
our overall membership persistency rate could become lower when the memberships in force include a higher proportion of newer memberships  as will happen following periods of rapid growth 
our overall membership persistency rate could also become lower when the new enrollments include a higher proportion of non associate members 
unless offset by other factors  these factors could result in a decline in our overall membership persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new memberships written are less persistent 
expected membership life using historical data through for all past members enrolled  the expected membership life can be computed to be approximately three years 
this number represents the average number of years a new membership can be expected to remain in force 
although about half of all new memberships may lapse in the first year  the expected membership life is much longer due to the contribution of higher annual retention rates in subsequent years 
since our experience is that the retention rate of a given generation of new memberships improves with membership age  the expected remaining membership life of a membership also increases with membership age 
for example  while a new membership may have an expected membership life of three years  the expected remaining membership life of a membership that reaches its first year anniversary is approximately years 
since the actual population of memberships in force at any time is a distribution of ages from zero to more than years  the expected remaining membership life of the entire population at large greatly exceeds four years per membership 
as of december   based on the historical data described above  the current expected remaining membership life of the actual population is approximately years per membership 
this measure is used by us to estimate the future revenues expected from memberships currently in place 
expected membership life measures are based on more than years of historical membership retention data  unlike the membership persistency rate described above which is computed from  and determined by  the most recent one year period only 
both or these measures however include data from memberships of all membership ages and hence are referred to as blended measures 
actions that may impact retention in the future the potential impact on our future profitability and cash flow due to future changes in membership retention can be significant 
while blended retention rates have not changed dramatically over the past five years  we have implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the retention rate of both new and existing memberships 
such initiatives include an optional revised compensation structure featuring variable renewal commission rates ranging from five to per annum based on the month membership retention rate of the associate s personal sales and those of his organization and implementation of a non taken administrative fee to sales associates of for any membership application that is processed but for which a payment is never received 
we have designed and implemented an enhanced member life cycle communication process aimed at both increasing the overall amount of communication from us to the members as well as more specific target messaging to members based on the length of their membership as well as utilization characteristics 
during  we began providing an additional service focused on membership retention  member advantage services  to our associates for a one time fee of per membership 
this service consists of several out bound calls  emails and letters by our employees during the first year of the membership as well as out bound calls to the member any time the membership moves into pre cancel status throughout the life of the membership 
we verify the membership data in our files on the very first call and make any necessary changes immediately as well as fully explain the membership benefits and answer any questions the member may have  essentially reselling the membership 
we provide provider law firm contact information and make sure the member understands how to contact their provider 
we encourage our members to immediately begin the process of having their will prepared and help the member begin the credit monitoring process for identity theft shield members 
we believe that such efforts may ultimately increase the utilization by members and therefore lead to higher retention rates 
we intend to continue to develop programs and initiatives designed to improve retention 
at december   approximately  memberships were part of our member advantage services 
results of operations comparison of to net income for decreased to million from million for diluted earnings per share for remained constant at per share due to decreased net income of and an approximate decrease in the weighted average number of outstanding shares 
membership fees and their impact on total revenues in any period are determined directly by the number of active memberships in force during any such period and the average annual fee 
the active memberships in force are determined by both the number of new memberships sold in any period together with the renewal rate of existing memberships 
new membership sales increased during to  from  during at december   there were  active memberships in force compared to  at december   a decrease of 
however  the average annual fee per membership has increased from for all memberships in force at december  to for all memberships in force at december   a increase  primarily because of an increase in the percentage of members with our identity theft shield membership 
these changes resulted in a decrease in membership fees for to million from million for marking the first decline in membership fees in years 
associate services revenue increased from million for to million during primarily because of more associates recruited due to increased bonuses and incentives 
the eservice fees totaled million during compared to million for  a decrease of 
we recognized revenue from associate fees of approximately million during compared to million during  an increase of 
new associates typically pay a fee ranging from to  depending on special promotions we implement from time to time 
new enrollments of sales associates increased during to  from  for and the average associate fee paid during was compared to for  an increase of due to higher average enrollment fees charged to new associates 
future revenues from associate services will depend primarily on the number of new associates enrolled  the price charged for new associates and the number who choose to participate in our eservice program  but we expect that such revenues will continue to be largely offset by the direct and indirect cost to us of training  providing associate services and other direct marketing expenses 
other revenue decreased  from million to million primarily due to the decrease in revenue recognized from membership enrollment fees 
primarily because of the decrease in membership fees  total revenues decreased to million for from million during  a decrease of 
membership benefits  which primarily represent payments to provider law firms and kroll  totaled million for compared to million for and represented of membership fees for both years 
this membership benefit ratio membership benefits as a percentage of membership fees should be slightly reduced going forward as substantially all active memberships provide for a capitated cost and we have reduced the capitated cost of the identity theft plan benefits effective april  with reductions effective beginning january   and commissions to associates increased from million for to million for  and represented and of membership fees  respectively 
commissions to associates are primarily dependent on the number of new memberships sold during a period and the average fee of those memberships 
new memberships sold during totaled  a increase from the  sold during  and the add on idt membership sales  which are not included in these totals  increased to  for from  for new membership fees written during increased with commissions to associates increasing 
associate services and direct marketing expenses increased million to million for from million for we had a  decrease in direct marketing and marketing services costs  a million increase in training fees and bonuses  a  increase in player s club costs and a million increase in the cost of associate kits 
training fees and bonuses are affected by the number of new sales associates that successfully meet the qualification criteria established by us  ie more training bonuses will be paid when a higher number of new sales associates meet such criteria 
these expenses include the costs of providing associate services and marketing expenses as discussed under member and associate costs

comparison of to net income for increased to million from million for diluted earnings per share for increased to per share from per share for the prior year due to increased net income of and an approximate decrease in the weighted average number of outstanding shares 
membership fees and their impact on total revenues in any period are determined directly by the number of active memberships in force during any such period and the average annual fee 
the active memberships in force are determined by both the number of new memberships sold in any period together with the renewal rate of existing memberships 
new membership sales decreased during to  from  during at december   there were  active memberships in force compared to  at december   a decrease of 
however  the average annual fee per membership has increased from for all memberships in force at december  to for all memberships in force at december   a increase  primarily because of an increase in the percentage of members with our identity theft shield membership 
these changes resulted in a increase in membership fees for to million from million for marking the sixteenth consecutive year of increased membership revenue 
associate services revenue decreased from million for to million during primarily because of fewer associates recruited 
the eservice fees totaled million during compared to million for  a decrease of 
we recognized revenue from associate fees of approximately million during compared to million during  a decrease of 
new associates typically pay a fee ranging from to  depending on special promotions we implement from time to time 
although the new enrollments of sales associates decreased during to  from  for  the average associate fee paid during was compared to for  an increase of due to higher average enrollment fees charged to new associates 
other revenue decreased  from million to million primarily due to the decrease in revenue recognized from membership enrollment fees

membership benefits  which primarily represent payments to provider law firms and kroll  totaled million for compared to million for and represented and of membership fees  respectively 
commissions to associates decreased from million for to million for  and represented and of membership fees  respectively 
commissions to associates are primarily dependent on the number of new memberships sold during a period and the average fee of those memberships 
new memberships sold during totaled  a decrease from the  sold during  and the add on idt membership sales that are not included in these totals decreased to  for from  for although our new membership fees written during decreased  commissions to associates declined only due to a change effective april  when we began advancing commissions on the first membership sale and in june when we added additional levels expansion bonuses to our compensation plan 
associate services and direct marketing expenses decreased million to million for from million for we had a million decrease in direct marketing and marketing services costs and a  decrease in training fees and bonuses and a  decrease in player s club costs 
training fees and bonuses are affected by the number of new sales associates that successfully meet the qualification criteria established by us  ie more training bonuses will be paid when a higher number of new sales associates meet such criteria 
these expenses include the costs of providing associate services and marketing expenses as discussed under member and associate costs 
general and administrative expenses during and were million and million  respectively  and represented of membership fees for such years 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases in advertising  consultant fees  employee expenses  and legal fees 
we had decreases in our bank service charges and telecommunication costs during other expenses  net  which includes depreciation and amortization  litigation accruals  premium taxes and interest expense reduced by interest income  decreased to million for from million for depreciation and amortization increased to million for from million for litigation settlements and change in litigation accrual was  for compared to  during premium taxes decreased from million for to million for interest expense decreased to million for compared to million for the prior year

the provision included a million charge  representing of income before income taxes  relating to income taxes for years and prior 
this charge resulted from a clerical error  which we discovered and corrected  in the amount of net operating loss reported in a state income tax return which resulted in nonpayment of income taxes in that state for several years 
the and provisions include state income taxes of million and million  respectively  net of federal benefits  representing and  respectively  of income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the number of active memberships in force and the average monthly fee will directly determine membership fees collected and their contribution to cash flow from operations during any period 
cash receipts from associate services are directly impacted by the number of new sales associates enrolled and the price of entry during the period  the number of associates subscribing to our eservice offering and the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force 
the cash outlay related to membership benefits is directly impacted by the number of active memberships and the contractual rate that exists between us and our benefits providers 
commissions paid to associates are primarily dependent on the number and price of new memberships sold during a period and any special incentives that may be in place during the period 
cash requirements related to associate services and direct marketing activities are directly impacted by the number of new associates enrolled during a period due to the cost of materials provided to such new associates  the number of associates subscribing to our eservice offering  the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force as well as the number of those associates who successfully meet the incentive award program qualifications 
membership revenues are more than sufficient to fund the cash requirements for membership benefits at approximately of membership revenues  commissions ranging from to of membership revenues and general and administrative expense at approximately to of membership revenues 
we have generated significant cash flow from operations of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  which has been used to provide for future growth in memberships  to repay our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and as discussed below  we have used a significant portion of our cash flow to repurchase shares of our stock 
cash flow from operations could be reduced if we experienced significant growth in new members because of the negative cash flow characteristics of our commission advance policies discussed above 
because of our ability to generate cash flow from operations  including in periods of membership growth  we have not historically been dependent on  and do not expect to need in the future  external sources of financing from the sale of securities or from bank borrowings to fund our basic business operations 
however  as described below  during the last three years  we incurred debt for limited and specific purposes to permit us to purchase equipment and to accelerate our treasury stock purchase program 
general consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million primarily due to membership activities being unchanged  a million reduction in interest payments due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates  a million decrease in income tax payments partially offset by a million decrease in associate activities 
member activities were unchanged with a million decrease in cash received from our members due to a lower number of memberships in force during the year which was offset by a million decrease in payments to our membership benefit providers  a million decrease in commission payments to our associates and a million decrease in general and administrative expenses 
associate activities decreased by million due to a million increase in associate fees collected due to the increase in new recruits driven in part by increased bonuses and other incentives offset by a million decrease in eservice fees collected and an million increase in associate services cost primarily due to the increase in bonuses and incentive payments 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
sales and maturities of available for sale investments exceeded the purchases of such investments by million   and million during  and net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this million change during was primarily comprised of a million increase in purchases of treasury stock and a million decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt 
we had a consolidated working capital deficit of million at december   an increase of million compared to a consolidated working capital deficit of million at december  the increase was primarily due to the million decrease in available for sale investments and the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by the  decrease in the current portion of notes payable  a  increase in refundable income taxes  a million increase in deferred revenue and fees and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the million working capital deficit at december  would have been million in excess working capital excluding the million of current portion of deferred revenue and fees in excess of the current portion of deferred member and associate service costs 
these amounts will be eliminated by the passage of time without the utilization of other current assets or us incurring other current liabilities 
additionally  at the current rate of cash flow provided by operations million during  we do not expect any difficulty in meeting our financial obligations in the short term or the long term 
we generally advance significant commissions to associates at the time a membership is sold 
we expense these advances ratably over the first month of the related membership 
during  we paid advance commissions to associates of million on new membership sales compared to million for since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created on a per membership basis at the time a membership is sold 
since there are no further commissions paid on a membership during the advance period  we typically derive significant positive cash flow from the membership over its remaining life 
see commissions to associates above for additional information on advance commissions 
we announced on april   a treasury stock purchase program authorizing management to acquire up to  shares of our common stock 
the board of directors has increased such authorization from  shares to million shares during subsequent board meetings 
the most recent authorization was for million additional shares on november  at december   we had purchased million treasury shares under these authorizations for million  an average price of per share  including million of purchases in treasury stock purchases will be made at prices that are considered attractive by management and at such times  that management believes will not unduly affect our liquidity  however  due to restrictions contained in our debt agreements with lenders  we are limited in our treasury stock purchases 
at december   we had approximately million of availability under existing bank covenant restrictions to purchase additional treasury shares 
no time limit has been set for completion of the treasury stock purchase program 
given the current interest rate environment  the nature of other investments available and our expected cash flows  management believes that purchasing treasury shares enhances shareholder value 
we expect to continue our treasury stock program 
from time to time  we evaluate alternative sources of financing to continue or accelerate this program 
we believe that we have the ability to finance the next twelve months of operations  anticipated capital expenditures and required debt repayment obligations based on our existing amount of cash and cash equivalents and unpledged investments at december  of million 
we believe our long term liquidity needs will be met by our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we expect to maintain cash and cash equivalents and investment balances on an on going basis of approximately million to million in order to meet expected working capital needs and regulatory capital requirements 
balances in excess of this amount would be used for discretionary purposes such as treasury stock purchases  dividends  and advance repayment of debt subject to the restrictions contained in our debt agreements 
notes payable in addition to customary covenants for loans of a similar type  the principal covenants for the senior loan are a limitation on incurring any indebtedness in excess of the remaining existing bank indebtedness outstanding and million in permitted capitalized leases or purchase money debt  a limitation on our ability to pay dividends or make stock purchases  other than with the net proceeds of the term loan  unless we meet certain cash flow tests  a prohibition on prepayment of other debt  a requirement to maintain consolidated ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for a rolling twelve month period ending december  and each quarter thereafter of at least million million for us and our top tier direct subsidiaries  a requirement to maintain a quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda with certain adjustments divided by the sum of interest expense  income taxes and scheduled principal payments of at least to  a requirement to maintain at least million members  a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio funded indebtedness as of the end of each quarter divided by ebitda for the trailing twelve months of no more than to  we must have availability unused portion of the revolving facility plus qualified cash the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents greater than or equal to  and an event of default occurs if harland stonecipher ceases to be our chairman and chief executive officer for a period of days unless replaced with a person approved by wells fargo 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  additional information regarding notes payable is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
parent company funding and dividends although we are the operating entity in many jurisdictions  our subsidiaries serve as operating companies in various states that regulate memberships as insurance or specialized legal expense products 
the most significant of these wholly owned subsidiaries are pplci  pplsif and lspv 
the ability of these subsidiaries to provide funds to us is subject to a number of restrictions under various insurance laws in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business  including limitations on the amount of dividends and management fees that may be paid and requirements to maintain specified levels of capital and reserves 
in addition  pplci will be required to maintain its stockholders equity at levels sufficient to satisfy various state or provincial regulatory requirements  the most restrictive of which is currently million 
additional capital requirements of pplci  pplsif or lspv  or any of our regulated subsidiaries  will be funded by us in the form of capital contributions or surplus debentures 
at january   none of pplci  pplsif or lspv had funds available for payment of substantial dividends without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries was million  representing amounts that may not be paid to us as dividends either under the applicable regulations or without regulatory approval 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  caption payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years 
del long term debt      purchase obligations    deferred compensation plan   capital leases  operating leases interest payments on outstanding debt total  del 
includes contractual commitments pursuant to executory contracts for products and services such as voice and data services and contractual obligations related to future company events such as hotel room blocks  meeting space and food and beverage guarantees 
we expect to receive proceeds from such future events and reimbursement from provider law firms for certain voice and data services that will partially offset these obligations 
interest payments on our long term debt have been calculated using the interest rates as of december  applied to the projected loan balances assuming principal payments according to the terms of each loan does not include commitments for attorney provider payments  commissions  etc 
which are expected to remain in existence for several years but as to which our obligations vary directly either based on membership revenues or new memberships sold and are not readily estimable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk our consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to our significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
caption as of december   our investments consisted of the following description fair value 
del obligations of state and political subdivisions  certificates of deposit  corporate obligations auction rate securities u 
s 
government obligations total investments  del 
we do not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on our fixed maturity investment portfolio 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios 
the fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table caption hypothetical change estimated fair value in interest rate after hypothetical fair value bp basis points change in interest rate dollars in thousands 
del fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  del 
excluding short term investments in certificates of deposit and auction rate certificates with a fair value of million at december  and short term investments in certificates of deposit with a fair value of million at december  the table above illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would reduce the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
at december   and based on the fair value of fixed maturity investments of million  an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
the definitive extent of the interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates  but we do not believe such risk is material 
we primarily manage our exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing investments that can be readily liquidated should the interest rate environment begin to significantly change 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million in notes payable outstanding at interest rates indexed to the day libor rate that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on the floating rate debt  annual interest expense would increase by approximately  as of december   we had not entered into any interest rate swap agreements with respect to the term loans or the variable rate municipal bonds 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income and assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates is not a substantial risk  as less than of our revenues are derived outside of the united states 
as reflected in the attached consolidated statements of comprehensive income  we have recorded positive foreign currency translation adjustments of million during and have a cumulative positive foreign currency translation adjustment balance of million at december  these amounts are subject to change dynamically in conjunction with the relative values of the canadian and us dollars
