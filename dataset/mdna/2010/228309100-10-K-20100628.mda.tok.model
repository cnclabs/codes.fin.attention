this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table contains results of operations for fiscal years and and the dollar and percentage changes for those periods in thousands  except percentages

these increases were offset by million in discontinued programs and million in lower replenishment orders 
sales of bib  bath and disposable products increased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
sales increased by million due to sales of new designs and promotions and higher replenishment orders 
sales also increased by million due to the company s acquisition of substantially all of the assets of neat solutions  inc on july  the neat solutions acquisition 
offsetting these increases was a decrease of million due to programs that were discontinued and lower initial program shipments 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased in amount and also increased as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in the percentage is due primarily to decreased amortization costs of  and the absence in the current year of  in charges incurred in the prior year related to transitioning away from the company s warehousing and shared services agreement  all of which were associated with the company s acquisition of the baby products line of springs global us  inc on november  also  the company in the current year has incurred decreased product development costs of  and decreased costs of  to operate the company s foreign representative office in china  offset by a  increase in testing costs and increased amortization of  associated with the neat solutions acquisition

the company has also incurred increased advertising costs and factoring fees of  and  respectively  in the current year as compared to the prior year 
these increases were offset by the absence in the current year of  of costs incurred in the prior year that were associated with the governance and standstill agreement entered into on july  with wynnefield small cap value  lp and its affiliates 
goodwill impairment charge the market capitalization of the company was below its net book value for most of the second half of fiscal year  which the company concluded was a triggering event that required the company to perform an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its reporting units 
as a result of step one of this interim impairment test  the company concluded that the fair values of its two reporting units were below their carrying values  indicating that the goodwill within these reporting units had been impaired 
in step two of the interim impairment test  the goodwill of the reporting units was determined to have no implied value 
accordingly  during fiscal year  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  which represented the aggregate carrying value of the goodwill of the company s reporting units 
this impairment charge did not result in any cash expenditures  did not have an adverse effect on the company s compliance with the covenants under its financing agreement and did not affect the company s financial availability under its revolving line of credit 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to lower variable rates and lower average balances on the company s term loan and revolving line of credit 
management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations 
the company has traditionally attempted to increase its prices to offset inflation 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to adequately increase its prices in response to inflation 
known trends and uncertainties the company s financial results are closely tied to the sales to the company s top two customers  which represented approximately of the company s gross sales in fiscal year these customers have been experiencing the impact of a significant economic downturn  which is restricting the company s opportunities for growth with respect to these customers 
should economic conditions not improve or further deteriorate  the company could experience continued revenue pressure 
the company s financial results are also closely tied to the sales of licensed products  which represented of the company s gross sales in both fiscal years and the company s current infant and toddler license agreements with disney expire december  and december   respectively 
the company could experience a material loss of revenues if it is unable to renew these license agreements or its other major license agreements or obtain new licenses

financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march  the change in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and deferred income taxes  offset by changes in accounts payable 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared million in the prior year 
cash used in investing activities in the current year was primarily associated with the neat solutions acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net repayments under the company s revolving line of credit 
total debt outstanding under the company s credit facilities before the reduction for the original issue discount on the non interest bearing notes decreased from million at march  to million at march  the decrease is due to net repayments on the company s revolving line of credit from available cash balances and operating cash flow and from payments on the company s term loan from operating cash flow 
the company s daily cash needs are provided by a revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with the cit group commercial services  inc cit  a subsidiary of cit group inc 
the company had previously built up its cash reserves in order to preserve the company s ability to meet its working capital needs in the event that cit should suffer an adverse liquidity event that would jeopardize the company s ability to draw upon its revolving line of credit 
on november   cit group inc and cit group funding company of delaware llc collectively  the cit holding companies each filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the filings were made pursuant to a prepackaged plan of reorganization the plan which was approved by a majority of the holders of debt securities of the cit holding companies 
the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on december  the company  believing that the emergence of the cit holding companies from bankruptcy  their restructured balance sheet and deferral of their required debt maturities for three years would make the possibility of an adverse liquidity event for cit less likely  repaid million to cit under the revolving line of credit on december  the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay the interest on its maturing indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance 
the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations and availability on its revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
at march  and march   the company s long term debt consisted of the following in thousands march  march  revolving line of credit term loan non interest bearing notes original issue discount less current maturities the company s credit facilities at march  consisted of the following revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with cit of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime minus at march  for base rate borrowings or libor plus at march   maturing on july  and secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
at march   there was a balance due on the revolving line of credit of million  there were no letters of credit outstanding against the million sub limit for letters of credit and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 

table of contents the financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  dividends  transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  subordinated notes of million 
the notes do not bear interest and are due in two equal installments of million each  the first of which is payable on july   and the second of which is payable on july  the original issue discount of million on this non interest bearing obligation at a market interest rate of is being amortized over the life of the notes 
the remaining unamortized balance of  is included in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of march  annual maturities of the company s credit facilities are as follows in thousands fiscal year revolver sub notes total total to reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance the predictability of its cash flow  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to cit pursuant to factoring agreements 
cit approves customer accounts and credit lines and collects the company s accounts receivable balances 
under the terms of the factoring agreements  which expire on july   cit remits payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer fails to pay cit by the due date  the company is charged interest at prime minus  which was at march   until payment is received 
during fiscal years and  the company incurred interest expense of  and  respectively  as a result of the failure of the company s customers to pay cit by the due date 
cit bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved customers that are within approved credit limits 
the company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
cit may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination were to occur  the company must either assume the credit risks for shipments after the date of such termination or cease shipments to such customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates the listing below  while not inclusive of all of the company s accounting policies  sets forth those accounting policies which the company s management believes embody the most significant judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates are made with respect to the allowances related to accounts receivable for customer deductions for returns  allowances and disputes 
the company also has a certain amount of discontinued finished goods which necessitates the establishment of inventory reserves that are highly subjective 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances and volume rebates are recorded commensurate with sales activity and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales 
table of contents in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are not material and are included in net sales 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as advertising and warehouse allowances and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon advertising support  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales and such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have no impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity 
the company assigns the majority of its receivables with cit pursuant to factoring agreements 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to credit worthiness  cit bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
at march   the company s accounts receivable amounted to million  net of allowances of million 
of this amount  million was due from cit under the factoring agreements 
depreciation and amortization the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect property  plant and equipment  and certain intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are three to eight years for property  plant and equipment  and one to sixteen years for intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company amortizes improvements to its leased facilities over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in addition to the depreciation and amortization procedures set forth above  the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less estimated costs to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company tests the carrying value of its goodwill annually and sooner if facts and circumstances suggest that the goodwill has been impaired 
the company reported no goodwill at march   and  as a result  the annual impairment test was not required 
royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
total royalty expense included in cost of sales amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company s financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company s inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company s consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in an accounting period 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to acquire inventory  bring it to a condition suitable for sale  and store it until it is sold 
once cost has been determined  the company s inventory is then stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined 
table of contents using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are acquired 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company s finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
differences would result in the valuation of the company s inventories and in the amount and timing of the company s cost of goods sold and resulting net income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be sold within the normal operating cycle of the company s operations 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is otherwise no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory value is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
only when inventory for which an allowance has been established is later sold or is otherwise disposed is the allowance reduced accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may not fully realize the carrying value of its inventory or may need to establish additional allowances  either of which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
provisions for income taxes the company s provisions for income taxes include all currently payable federal  state  local and foreign taxes that are based upon the company s taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company recognizes the effect that changes in tax rates will have on net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period that the tax rates are changed 
the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based upon an effective tax rate  excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge  of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
these effective tax rates are the sum of the top us statutory federal income tax rate and a composite rate for state income taxes net of federal tax benefit in the various states in which the company operates 
the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
based on its recent evaluation  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
tax years still open to federal or state general examination or other adjustment as of march  include tax years ended april   april   march   march  and march  the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on any estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which established the fasb accounting standards codification the fasb asc as the authoritative source for gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities

the fasb will now revise gaap by issuing an accounting standards update asu to the fasb asc 
an asu will not be considered as authoritative in its own right  but will serve only to update the fasb asc  provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusion on the change in the fasb asc

fasb asc topic became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  on march   the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc topic upon adoption  the company did not elect the fair value option for any items within the scope of fasb asc topic  therefore  the adoption of fasb asc topic did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb asc topic  which contains revisions to fasb asc topic  business combinations  and was to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years
