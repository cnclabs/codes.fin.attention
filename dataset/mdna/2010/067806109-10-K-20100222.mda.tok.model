item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview effective january   the company retroactively adopted the provisions of a newly issued accounting standard for certain convertible debt instruments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for further discussion of the impact of adoption 
all previously reported financial information has been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect this change in accounting for all periods presented 
highlights in  the economic challenges which started during continued and  in some cases  increased in many of our end markets 
the logistics and manufacturing services segment was negatively affected by lower demand across the end markets of its distribution business and by deferred maintenance in its aerospace aftermarket business 
precision components industrial manufacturing business was impacted by the declines in end markets it serves  including the transportation related market  while its aerospace oem business was affected by reduced customer inventory and production levels 
as a result  sales decreased in both business segments and were down to  million company wide 
during  the company took further actions primarily at precision components to restructure its operations which consisted primarily of workforce reductions and moving the operations of certain facilities and resulted in charges in of approximately million 
additionally  as a result of actions taken in  the company recorded additional costs of million in related to transfer of work and facility exits 
the actions  along with the actions taken by the company in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of the economic downturn  improved the company s cost structure and its manufacturing footprint  thereby strengthening its global competitive position and readiness for improving economic conditions 
cash generation and working capital management were a primary focus of the company s efforts in particular attention on collecting receivables from customers  reducing inventory and managing payment terms with vendors contributed to the generation of million of cash from operating activities in the additional cash generation was used primarily to reduce overall debt levels and in part to fund a million cash contribution to the company s pension plans 
the company also repurchased certain of its convertible notes in exchange for treasury shares during these actions to reduce overall debt levels contributed to the company s ability to comply with its debt covenants 
management objectives management is focused on three areas of development employees  processes and strategy which  in combination  are expected to generate long term value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products  services  markets and customers  and growth from acquisitions 
the company s strategies for profitability include productivity and process initiatives  such as production realignment  and efficiency and cost saving measures 
our business barnes group consists of two operating segments logistics and manufacturing services  and precision components 
in both of these businesses  barnes group is among the leaders in the market niches served  and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures 
the logistics and manufacturing services segment provides value added logistical support and repair services 
value added logistical support services include inventory management  technical sales  and supply chain solutions for maintenance  repair  operating  and production supplies and services 
repair services provided include the manufacturing of spare parts for the refurbishment and repair of highly engineered components and assemblies for commercial and military aviation 

table of contents precision components is a global supplier of engineered components for critical applications focused on providing solutions for a diverse industrial  transportation and aerospace customer base

key performance indicators management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses  as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
management also uses an internal measurement tool called ppat  or performance profit after tax 
ppat is an economic value added eva like metric that calculates operating profit after tax  less a charge for the capital employed by the business 
management utilizes ppat in economic decision making  such as capital expenditures  investments in growth initiatives  customer pricing decisions  and evaluation of acquisitions 
the goal of utilizing ppat is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation 
in addition to ppat  which is a measurement tool common in each operating unit  both segments have standard key performance indicators kpis  a number of which are focused on customer metrics customer satisfaction score  on time delivery and quality  internal effectiveness and efficiency metrics sales per employee  scrap and rework  days working capital and controllable expenses  employee related metrics total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate  and unique kpis on organic growth 
key industry data in each segment  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at logistics and manufacturing services  the distribution business reviews data supplied by the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in canada and for the european based businesses 
management of the aftermarket aerospace operations monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet  the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service  aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines  shop visits  and traffic growth 
at precision components  key data for the industrial manufacturing operations include the ipi  the production of light vehicles  both in the us and globally  tooling build schedules  durable goods orders  compressor build forecasts  and global industrial capital expenditures 
the aerospace oem business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers  as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft 
management also monitors annual appropriations for the us military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance 
acquisitions and strategic relationships acquisitions and strategic relationships have been a key growth driver for the company in both of its business segments 
the company has acquired a number of businesses in the past  the most recent of which was in the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions that could broaden product line offerings and 
table of contents expand geographic reach  and provide synergistic opportunities 
the company continues to seek business alliances which foster long term business relationships  such as the aftermarket rsp agreements and strategic supply agreements

the decrease in cost of sales was less than the percentage decrease in sales and resulted in a reduction in gross profit margin of percentage points 
selling and administrative expenses decreased from the decreases in cost of 
table of contents sales and selling and administrative expenses resulted primarily from the significantly lower sales volumes in each of the businesses of logistics and manufacturing services and precision components and  to a lesser extent  from the benefits of discrete cost reduction actions taken in and the costs of million recorded in which related to the and actions taken primarily at precision components to restructure its operations were recorded primarily in selling and administrative expenses 
see further discussion of the actions below 
as a result  operating income in decreased from and operating margin decreased from to 
operating income in decreased from to million and operating margin remained at 
the decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower profitability at precision components and the impact on both segments of the costs associated with the discrete fourth quarter charges 
see further discussion of the actions below 
cost of sales decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales 
the decrease in cost of sales was in line with the decrease in sales  resulting in a gross profit margin at which approximated the margin 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat at in and the discrete costs of the fourth quarter actions included in selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower additional compensation and the positive impacts of expense reduction and lean initiatives 
during  the company authorized the restructuring of certain operations of the precision components segment by moving the operations of two facilities 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring and related costs of million in which included million of employee termination costs  million of asset write downs  million of equipment transfer costs  million of facility use termination costs and million of pension curtailment costs 
also during  the company implemented other workforce reduction actions at precision components and recorded severance expense of million 
in addition  as a result of actions taken in  the company recorded additional costs of million related to transfer of work and facility exits 
these costs are primarily recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the actions are expected to generate cost savings in and beyond 
during  the company took a number of actions within each of the businesses primarily in the fourth quarter to reduce overhead costs as the company aggressively addressed economic conditions  the state of end markets served and structural complexities within certain geographies 
the cost of these discrete actions totaled million after tax in including million included in loss from discontinued operations 
the pre tax charges in totaled million and included million of severance and related employee termination costs  a million loss on sale of assets related to discontinued businesses and million of other costs including contract terminations  asset impairment charges and other associated costs 
of the charges  million were recorded in cost of sales  million were recorded in selling and administrative expenses and million were recorded in discontinued operations 
the million tax expense includes the valuation and write off of certain deferred tax assets 
these and actions improved the company s cost structure and its manufacturing footprint  and strengthened its global competitive position

other expenses  net of other income  in were million and included the million loss on the sale of spectrum plastics 
other expenses in included million in net foreign currency transaction losses 
interest expense decreased million in from as a result of lower interest rates 

table of contents income taxes the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared with in the decrease in the effective tax rate from was due primarily to the higher concentration of profits in lower taxing jurisdictions and the absence of profitability in higher tax jurisdictions 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared with in the effective tax rate included additional tax expense of million for the valuation of certain deferred tax assets in france and the united kingdom 
these discrete items in increased the effective tax rate percentage points 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate 
among other items which could impact the future tax rate is the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions where the company operates 
in connection with an internal revenue service irs audit for the tax years through  the irs proposed adjustments to these tax years of approximately million  plus a potential penalty of of the tax assessment plus interest 
the adjustment relates to the federal taxation of foreign income of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company filed an administrative protest of these adjustments 
in the third quarter of  the company was informed that its protest was denied and a tax assessment was received from the appeals office of the irs 
in november  the company filed a petition in the us tax court against the tax assessment received 
the company continues to believe its tax position on the issues raised by the irs is correct and the company plans to continue to take appropriate actions to vigorously defend its position 
the company believes it will prevail on this issue 
any additional impact on the company s liability for income taxes cannot presently be determined  but the company continues to believe it is adequately provided for and the outcome will not have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  the company exited certain non core businesses within its logistics and manufacturing services segment in the united kingdom 
these exit activities included the sale of certain assets and transfer of related employees  liquidation of assets  termination of related contracts  and severing of employees 
the results of these businesses have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations for all years reported 
in  the million loss included a million loss related to the exit activities 
of this amount approximately million reflected the loss on the sales  approximately million were employee related costs  including severance and other termination benefits  and approximately million related to other costs including contract termination charges 
in addition  a tax expense of approximately million included in discontinued operations related to the valuation and write off of certain deferred tax assets 
the results for represent the operating loss on the discontinued operations 
the losses for all years are reported net of tax

the decreases were directly attributable to the decline in income from continuing operations 
basic weighted average shares outstanding decreased slightly as a result of the impact of stock repurchases in offset in large part by  shares of treasury stock contributed to the company s pension plans and  shares of treasury stock used to repurchase certain of the company s convertible notes in diluted average shares outstanding decreased as a result of the decrease in basic weighted average shares outstanding and the decrease in the dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares under the employee stock plans and the convertible notes which was driven by a decline in the company s stock price 
financial performance by business segment logistics and manufacturing services in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin vs 
the logistics and manufacturing services business segment reported sales of million in  a decrease from the lower sales were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales in all businesses of million 
lower organic sales in resulted primarily from softness in the distribution business primarily in north america due to continued weakness in the transportation related and industrial markets and  to a lesser extent  a reduced distribution sales force compared to in addition  sales declines in the aerospace aftermarket were driven by lower aircraft utilization  deferred maintenance activities and an increase in the rsp management fees 
the negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately million in as the us dollar strengthened against foreign currencies  primarily in europe and canada  as compared to operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services in decreased from to million 
the decline in operating profit was driven by the profit impact of the lower sales volumes in each of its 
table of contents businesses due to the impact of economic conditions on the end markets served 
partially offsetting these declines was the positive impact of operational and productivity initiatives  including the lower operating costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in to address the deteriorating market conditions and geographical complexities  and to align the segment s cost structure with its declining sales 
outlook organic sales levels in the distribution businesses of the logistics and manufacturing services segment are largely dependent upon the economy in the regions served  the retention of its customers and continuation of existing sales volumes to such customers  and the effectiveness and size of its sales force 
near term economic conditions are expected to challenge these businesses as customers continue to actively manage costs and inventory levels 
management believes future sales growth will result from improvements in economic and end market conditions  further market penetration and sales force productivity initiatives  including increasing the sales force size 
near term sales levels in the aerospace aftermarket business are expected to continue to be impacted by deferred maintenance activities and lower capacity usage within the industry 
management believes its aerospace aftermarket business is favorably positioned based on strong customer relationships  including long term maintenance and repair contracts in the overhaul and repair business  and expected improvement in demand in the aftermarket spare parts business 
operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services is expected to continue to be affected by the profit impact of the changes in sales volume in each of its businesses as well as pricing pressures 
profitability is expected to be favorably impacted by structural changes made in the distribution businesses and other cost control efforts 
the highly profitable aftermarket rsps will continue to be impacted by the management fees payable to the customer which generally increase in the fourth or later years of each program 
these and other similar fees are deducted from sales and temper sales growth of the aftermarket rsps and operating margin 
vs 
the logistics and manufacturing services business segment reported sales of million in  a decrease from the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in organic sales of million 
lower organic sales were recorded by the distribution businesses in north america and in europe due to softness in the transportation related and certain manufacturing markets combined with the impact of initiatives which created sales force disruption primarily in north america 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in aerospace aftermarket sales resulting from growth in aftermarket rsps sales 
additionally  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of million as foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar  primarily in europe 
operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services in increased from to million 
operating profit in was positively impacted by operational and productivity improvements in the north american distribution business realized from the initiatives focused on improving the profitability of the business 
discrete costs incurred in related to these initiatives in north america and europe were million 
additionally  operating profit in included the positive impact of the profit contribution from the highly profitable aerospace aftermarket rsps 
partially offsetting these improvements was the profit impact of the lower sales volumes in the north american distribution business  primarily a result of sales force attrition and the impact of the economic conditions on the end markets served by this business 
additionally  in the logistics and manufacturing services segment recorded discrete fourth quarter charges including employee terminations  to address deteriorating market conditions and complexities within certain geographies 
costs associated with these actions were million 

table of contents precision components in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin vs 
sales at precision components in were million  a decrease from the lower sales levels were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales of million 
the industrial manufacturing businesses in north america and europe reported significant sales declines due to the global recession and its impact on the transportation industry and  in particular  the automotive sector 
additionally  sales decreased in the aerospace oem business as customers reduced inventory and lowered production levels 
the negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by million in as compared to spectrum plastics recorded sales of million in  thus the sale of this business in resulted in a reduction in sales of this amount in operating profit in at precision components was million  a decrease of from the decline in operating profits was driven by the impact of the lower sales volumes 
operating profit in was positively impacted by lower costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in late to address deteriorating market conditions including personnel reductions and plant consolidations  and initiatives focused on cost savings and cost containment 
the favorable impact of these initiatives  however  only partially offset the profit impact of the substantially lower sales levels in and approximately million of costs for actions taken throughout to address the continued deterioration in the market  including employee termination costs  asset write downs associated with consolidating certain facilities  and transfer of work costs 
outlook in the industrial manufacturing businesses  management is focused on generating organic sales growth by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end markets in which its businesses have a global presence as well as gaining market share 
sales growth in the global markets served by these businesses is expected to remain challenging due to economic conditions 
however  increased order activity in certain end markets  including the north american transportation market  may provide incremental benefits in the near term 
sales in the aerospace oem business are driven by its commercial engine order backlog through its participation in certain strategic engine programs 
backlog in this business was million at december   of which approximately is expected to be shipped in the next months 
the aerospace oem business may be further impacted by downward adjustments of customer inventory levels  production schedule delays or reductions of specific engine programs  and general softness in the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economic recession 
however  management believes that strong long term aerospace industry fundamentals remain which  together with pursuing new programs and increased content levels on certain platforms  will drive future sales growth in this business 
operating profit is largely dependant on the sales volumes within all businesses of the segment 
management expects a favorable impact on profitability and efficiency from the cost actions taken in these businesses including personnel reductions and facility consolidations  and other cost saving and cost containment initiatives 
management continues to focus on improving profitability through organic sales growth  pricing initiatives  and productivity and process improvements 
vs 
sales at precision components in were million  a decrease from organic sales were down million and were significantly impacted by weaker global economic conditions 
the most significant 
table of contents organic sales declines were in the north american industrial manufacturing businesses  primarily related to the transportation and consumer product end markets 
these declines were offset in part by year over year growth in the aerospace oem business on the strength of its sales order backlog which was million at january  impacting the year over year growth rate in precision components aerospace oem business was the impact of the boeing labor strike and order pushouts on the boeing program 
the sale of spectrum plastics in resulted in a reduction in sales of million 
the favorable impact on sales of foreign currency translation increased sales by approximately million as foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar  primarily in europe 
operating profit in at precision components was million  a decrease of from operating profit in was negatively impacted by lower sales levels and higher material costs 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of certain businesses within the precision components segment took cost reduction actions  including employee terminations and plant consolidations  to address deteriorating market conditions 
costs associated with these actions were million 
partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of the right sizing actions primarily in the domestic industrial manufacturing businesses  lower additional compensation and other cost saving initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
during  management placed significant focus on cash flow and working capital management  and anticipates that operating activities in will continue to generate significant  positive cash flow 
in light of current economic events  the company continues to monitor its cash generation  usage and preservation with particular emphasis placed on managing working capital 
management has been very selective when approving capital expenditures and expects discretionary capital spending in to be slightly higher than the million incurred in of the company s million in long term debt  only million is due in the company s senior subordinated convertible notes the convertible notes are subject to redemption at their par value at any time  at the option of the company  on or after february  the note holders may also require the company to redeem some or all of the notes on february st of  and the company s senior subordinated convertible notes the convertible notes are subject to redemption at their par value at any time  at the option of the company  on or after march  the note holders may also require the company to redeem some or all of the notes on march th of  and if any of the convertible notes are redeemed on february   the company intends to finance the redemption through the use of its available credit facilities 
continued uncertainty in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on  among other things  security prices and investment valuations 
the company s pension plans have been impacted by the losses in the global equity markets and  together with the requirements set forth by the federal pension protection act  the company s funding requirements increased 
the return on plan assets impacts the future funding requirements  pension expense and the company s balance sheet due to recognition of the funded status of the plans 
the company took specific actions in to increase the funded status of the plans  to meet the funding requirements and to mitigate potential required contributions beyond by making a cash contribution of million and an incremental stock contribution of million to its qualified pension plans 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets  the level of market interest rates and benefit obligations 
the funded status of the pension plans 
table of contents improved in primarily as a result of the increase in the fair value of the company s pension plan assets due mainly to the gains in the global equity markets 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in the projected benefit obligations of the plans 
the company s other postretirement benefit plans recorded a decline in the projected benefit obligation in as a result  the company recorded an million non cash after tax increase in stockholders equity through other non owner changes to equity to record the current year adjustment for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under the accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
approximately million in contributions were made by the company to its various pension plans in  million in the form of company stock and the remainder in the form of cash which included the required minimum contributions to its qualified us pension plans 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its various plans in operating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near term organic business expansion needs and the company s current financial commitments 
the credit markets have presented companies with significant challenges in maintaining or expanding credit facilities 
in  the company entered into a million unsecured credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na which could be used for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the drawdown period on this facility expired on december  the company has assessed its credit facilities and currently expects that its bank syndicate  comprised of banks  will continue to support the million credit facility which matures in september and that wells fargo bank  na will continue to support the million credit facility 
at december   the company had million of unused and available for borrowings under its million credit facility  subject to covenants in the company s debt agreements 
the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 
current credit lines are closely monitored to ensure compliance with the company s various debt covenants 
the company s most restrictive financial covenant the debt ratio requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to adjusted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement of not more than times at december  any breach of covenant would result in a technical default under the revolving credit agreement and may result in the banks forcing an acceleration of this debt 
the consequences of acceleration are that the company s debt would become callable and other obligations  including the convertible notes  which are subject to the cross acceleration provisions of the revolving credit agreement  could also become immediately due and payable 
the company has taken and continues to take actions to sustain compliance with the debt covenants primarily through strategies to increase adjusted ebitda or reduce debt 
the actual ratio at december  was times 
any future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash  borrowings and equity  or a combination thereof 
additionally  we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

table of contents operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating million in cash during compared to million in compared to  operating cash flows in were positively impacted by significant reductions in working capital offset in part by lower operating performance and  to a lesser extent  the million contribution to the company s pension plans 
the reductions in working capital resulted primarily from significantly lower inventory levels at both business segments reflecting management s efforts to generate cash from working capital improvements as well as reduced customer demand 
improvements in cash flows from receivables and payables resulted from focused efforts in all businesses to collect receivables from customers and manage payment terms with vendors 
investing activities in consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million compared to million in participation fee payments related to the aftermarket rsps of million and million were paid in and  respectively 
no payments were required under such agreements in investing activities in included the net proceeds of million from the sale of spectrum plastics 
cash used in financing activities in included a net decrease in borrowings of million compared to a net increase of million in the change included the repurchase of million par value of convertible notes at a discounted price of million which was funded primarily with borrowings under revolving credit lines 
additionally  in the higher cash generated from operations and the cash on hand were used for capital expenditures and dividends as well as debt reduction 
the proceeds in were used primarily to finance working capital requirements  capital expenditures  dividends and rsp payments 
total cash used to pay dividends decreased in by million to million due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding and a decrease in cash dividends from per share in to per share in during  the company repurchased million shares at an average cost of per share under the terms of its publicly announced repurchase program 
at december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  the majority of which are held outside the us in general  the repatriation of this cash to the us would have adverse tax consequences and the balances remain outside the us to fund future international investments 
the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
at december   million was borrowed at an average interest rate of under the company s million borrowing facility which matures in september  also  at december   million was borrowed at an average interest rate of under the company s million borrowing facility which matures in july  additionally  the company had million in borrowings under short term bank credit lines at an interest rate of at december  at december   the company s total borrowings are comprised of approximately fixed rate debt and approximately variable rate debt 
the interest payments on approximately of the variable rate interest debt have been converted into payment of fixed interest plus the borrowing spread under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents debt covenants borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the company s debt agreements

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions and goodwill assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value 
management completes their annual impairment assessment during the second quarter of each year 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach  which reflects management s cash flow projections  and or the market approach in accordance with current accounting standards 
inherent in management s development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates  including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both company specific and overall economic conditions 
in the second quarter of  management performed its annual impairment testing based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  including integrating acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company pays participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program
