item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive summary as of december   we own and operate thirteen timeshare resorts 
our income is derived principally from marketing and selling timeshare interests at our resorts in one week intervals and from the interest earned from financed sales of such timeshare interests 
as of december   we own a seven getaway resorts located within a two hour drive of major metropolitan areas  which are the primary market for timeshare sales to new purchasers  and b six destination resorts located farther from major metropolitan areas 
the principal purchasers of timeshare interests at the destination resorts are existing owners who are upgrading or buying additional interests 
we anticipate a continuation of the difficult economic environment we experienced throughout and these economic weaknesses present formidable challenges related to constrained consumer spending  collection of customer receivables  access to capital markets  and ability to manage inventory levels 
as a result  we anticipate a decline in our vacation interval sales of approximately during  thus our success in collecting payments due on customers loans in this challenging environment is heightened and will continue to pressure our operating results 
however  we believe that conservative business decisions and cash flow management during  along with other measures in the coming year  will allow us to maintain adequate liquidity through  including the payment of our million senior subordinated notes due april  these other measures include continuing to focus on improving the credit quality of our notes receivable  a continued favorable sales mix trend toward upgrades and second week sales to existing customers as such sales have relatively lower associated sales and marketing costs  reductions in capital expenditures for expansion at existing resorts  including construction of lodging units and additional amenities  negotiation of extensions to our existing credit facilities  and the management of our liquidity through business efficiencies 
however  there can be no assurance that economic conditions will not deteriorate further  which could increase customer loan delinquencies and defaults 
increases in loan delinquencies and defaults could impair our ability to pledge or sell such loans to lenders in order to obtain sufficient cash advances to meet our obligations through  including payment of the aforementioned senior subordinated notes 

table of contents the following economic or industry wide factors are relevant to us we predominantly sell vacation and recreational products to customers who drive to our locations 
we believe that this type of usage is somewhat immune from issues that would affect the travel industry as a whole ie  the disruptions to the airline industry and destination resort industry after september  and the current state of the economy 
however  major increases in gasoline prices or other issues that cause the u 
s population to drive less could have a negative impact on us 
telemarketing is a very important element in the generation of tours to potential new customers of timeshare interests 
we presently comply with state and national do not call regulations 
changes to existing regulations could have a negative impact on our ability to generate the necessary tours to sell timeshare interests 
we will continue to assess the do not call rules impact on both operations and alternative methods of marketing  such as direct mail  that are not impacted by the new rules 
we finance the majority of our sales over seven to ten years 
a sustained economic downturn could negatively affect the ability of our customers to pay the principal and interest due on their loans  which would result in additional estimated uncollectible revenue 
our fixed to floating debt ratio is fixed and floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
although interest rates remained fairly constant throughout  an increase in interest rates above applicable floor rates on our variable rate facilities could have a negative impact on our profitability 
since we predominantly finance our sales of timeshare interests  we require credit facilities to provide the liquidity necessary to fund our day to day costs and expenses 
we presently have adequate credit facilities to fund our operations through a disruption in the availability of credit facilities would severely impact our ability to continue marketing and selling timeshare interests as we do today 
we believe there are three areas which are particularly important to our success as a business identifying potential customers who are likely to pay their principal and interest payments when due after purchasing timeshare intervals  thereby resulting in an acceptable level of estimated uncollectible revenue 
maintaining sales and marketing expenses at an acceptable level to result in a favorable percentage relationship between sales and marketing expense and vacation interval sales 
maintaining adequate credit facilities to finance our operations and support the borrowings that are required for our liquidity and continued growth 
we earn revenue and income and finance our operations as follows our primary source of revenue is vacation interval sales 
vacation interval sales are a combination of sales to new customers and upgrade and or additional week sales to existing customers 
we have been focusing on increasing the percentage mix of sales to existing customers in recent years 
in addition  we have been focusing on identifying potential new customers who have more favorable credit characteristics and will ultimately be more likely to pay principal and interest on their timeshare notes when due 
to manage sales  we separately assess sales to potential new customers and sales to existing customers as different factors affect these types of sales 
for example  for sales to potential new customers  we measure sales per tour in order to ascertain that our marketing programs are delivering the proper types of family tours to effectively and efficient ly generate sales and we closely monitor rescission rates 
one product that is sold to new customers is a sampler  which gives the customer the right to use the resorts on an as available basis from sunday to thursday 
revenues related to sampler contracts  which entitle a prospective owner to sample a resort during certain periods  are deferred until the customer uses the stay or allows the contract to expire 
in accordance with the fasb asc real estate timesharing activities  sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
conversely  incremental revenues in excess of related incremental costs are recorded as a reduction of inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
incremental co sts include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
since our sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  providing us additional opportunities to sell vacation intervals to prospective customers  the incremental costs of our sampler sales typically exceed incremental sampler revenues 
accordingly  million  million  and million of sampler revenues were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense during the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents the following table shows the elements management considers important to assessing our vacation interval sales in thousands  except for tours and sales per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers sales per tour gross sales to new customers rescissions of sales to new customers net sales to new customers gross sales to existing customers rescissions of sales to existing customers net sales to existing customers total sales less sampler sales total vacation interval sales rescission rate for new customers rescission rate for existing customers rescission rate for all customers in assessing the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  we believe it is also important to compare sales and marketing expenses to vacation interval sales 
the separate elements of sales and marketing expense that we assess are the cost of marketing to new purchasers  the cost of marketing to existing purchasers  offsite marketing  commissions  and sales and marketing overhead as detailed in the following table in thousands  except for tours and cost per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers cost per tour cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense our second most important source of revenue is interest income  which is predominantly earned on our notes receivable 
total positive net interest spread interest income less interest expense and lender fees has increased each of the last five years 
for the years ended december    and  total positive net interest spread was million  million  and million  respectively 
we have two lesser revenue sources  management fees  predominantly from silverleaf club  and other income 
we generate cash from the collection of down payments  from the collection of principal and interest from timeshare notes receivable  from sales of notes receivable  and from management fees and other income 
we also generated cash during from the sale of undeveloped land at locations that had been previously acquired for the possible development of new resorts 

table of contents since the majority of our sales are financed  we have revolving credit facilities that are drawn upon monthly to fund our day to day costs  expenses  and capital expenditures 
we operate principally in only one business segment  the timeshare industry 
further  we only operate in the united states 
as of december   we operate resorts in six states texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida  and sell primarily to residents of those states  with limited sales to residents of nearby states 
in addition  we own and operate a hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado  which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
our principal short term focus is on continuing to conservatively increase annual net income 
we will continue to identify new and existing customers with acceptable credit characteristics that will allow us to profitably sell new  upgrade  and additional vacation intervals at our existing resorts 
although we have no immediate growth plans  long term  if the opportunities present themselves  we will consider adding and developing new resorts where timeshare intervals can be marketed and sold at a profit 
critical accounting policies timeshare accounting practices we follow industry specific guidance as required by fasb asc real estate timesharing activities 
in general  this accounting standard provides guidance on determining revenue recognition for timeshare transactions  evaluation of uncollectibility of vacation interval receivables  accounting for costs of vacation interval sales  accounting for operations during holding periods or incidental operations  and other accounting transactions specific to timeshare operations 
revenue and expense recognition including cost of sales vacation interval sales are primarily consummated in exchange for installment notes receivable secured by deeds of trust on each vacation interval sold 
if development costs related to a particular project or phase are complete  we recognize related vacation interval sales under the full accrual method after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all such criteria are met yet significant development costs remain to complete the project or phase  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  once the sales criteria are met  revenues are recog nized proportionate to costs already incurred relative to total costs expected for the project or phase 
as of december   no sales were deferred related to the percentage of completion method 
both of these revenue recognition methods employ the relative sales value method in determining related costs of sales and inventory applicable to each vacation interval sale recognized 
under the relative sales value method  a cost of sales percentage is used to apply costs to related sales as follows total revenues to be recognized over an entire project or phase  considering both revenues recognized to date plus estimated revenues to be recognized over future periods considering an estimate of uncollectibility and subsequent resale of recovered vacation intervals  are determined 
total costs of a project or phase  considering both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  are determined 
common costs  including amenities  are included in total estimated costs and allocated to inventory phases that such costs are expected to benefit 
the cost of sales ratio applied to each sale represents total estimated costs as a percentage of total estimated revenues  which is specific to each inventory phase 
generally  each building type is considered a separate phase 
the estimate of total revenue for a particular phase also considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
at least quarterly  we evaluate the estimated cost of sales percentage applied to each sale using updated information for total estimated phase revenue and total estimated phase costs 
the effects of changes in estimates are accounted for in the period in which such changes first become known on a retrospective basis  such that the balance sheet at the end of the period of change and the accounting in subsequent periods reflect the revised estimates as if such estimates had been the original estimates 
as mentioned  certain vacation interval sales transactions are deferred until the minimum down payment has been received 
we account for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a deposit until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as other income and the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
this income is not significant 
we also sell additional and upgraded vacation intervals to existing owners 
revenues are recognized on an additional vacation interval sale  which represents a new vacation interval sale treated as a separate transaction from the original vacation interval sale  when the buyer makes a down payment of at least  excluding any equity from the original vacation interval purchased 
revenues are recognized on an upgrade vacation interval sale  which is a modification and continuation of the original sale  by including the buyer s equity from the original vacation interval towards the down payment of at least 
revenue recognized on upgrade vacation interval sales represents the difference between the upgrade sales price and traded in sales price  while related cost of sales represents the increme ntal increase in the cost of the vacation interval purchased 

table of contents interest income is recognized as earned 
interest income is accrued on notes receivable  net of an estimated amount that will not be collected  until the individual notes become days delinquent 
once a note becomes days delinquent  the accrual of interest income ceases until collection is deemed probable 
management fees for services provided to silverleaf club and orlando breeze resort club are recognized in the period such services are provided if collection is deemed probable 
services and other income are recognized in the period such services are provided 
sales and marketing costs are recognized in the period incurred 
commissions  however  are recognized in the period the related revenues are recognized 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less 
cash and cash equivalents include cash  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
restricted cash restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit  collateral for construction bonds  surety bonds  and cash reserved for payments of debt 
allowance for uncollectible notes estimated uncollectible revenue is recorded at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible notes at a level management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is adjusted based upon a periodic static pool analysis of the notes receivable portfolio  which tracks uncollectible notes for each year s sales over the lives of the notes 
other factors considered in the assessment of uncollectibility include the aging of notes receivable  historical collection experience and credit losses  customer credit scores fico scores  and current economic factors 
credit losses represent three varieties as follows a full cancellation  whereby a customer is relieved of the note obligation and we recover the underlying inventory  a deemed cancellation  whereby we record the cancellation of all notes that become days delinquent  net of notes that are no longer days delinquent  and a note receivable reduction that occurs when a customer trades a higher value product for a lower value product or when a portion of a customer s note obligation is relieved 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is reduced by actual cancellations and losses experienced  including losses related to previously sold notes receivable which became delinquent and were reacquired pursuant to certain recourse obligations 
recourse on sales of customer notes receivable is governed by agreements between us and the purchasers of said notes  though we typically do not have an obligation to repurchase defaulted notes held by our financing subsidiaries 
our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
under the relative sales value method  an estimate of the value of inventory recoveries is considered in determining inventory costing and allocation to sales 
due to the state of the economy in general  and related deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets in recent years  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
we will continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults 
we will also maintain our focus on tour lead procurement in an effort to improve the credit quality of our customers 
during and  approximate ly and  respectively  of our sales were made to customers with fico scores below however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value less cost to sell 
cost includes amounts for land  construction materials  amenities and common costs  direct labor and overhead  taxes  and capitalized interest incurred in the construction or through the acquisition of resort dwellings held for timeshare sale 
at december   the estimated costs not yet incurred but expected to complete promised amenities was  inventory costs are allocated to cost of vacation interval sales using the relative sales value method  as described above 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventory on an individual project basis for impairment to ensure that the carrying value does not exceed market value 

table of contents vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure or ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded or downgraded vacation interval 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities as recognized by tax laws and their carrying value as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
a provision or benefit is recognized for deferred income taxes relating to such temporary differences  and is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled or recovered 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes th e enactment date 
the effect of income tax positions are recorded only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
although we do not currently have any material charges related to interest and penalties  such costs  if incurred  are reported within the provision for income taxes 
our federal tax return includes all items of income  gain  loss  expense  and credit of sf iii  which was a non consolidated subsidiary for reporting purposes and a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes 
we had a tax sharing agreement with sf iii 
we file us federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states 
we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by the internal revenue service for years prior to  although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to may still be subject to examination 
for the majority of state tax jurisdictions  we are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to in the state of texas  we are no longer subject to franchise tax examinations for years prior to liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december    and  we have been in full compliance with our debt covenants in our credit facilities with all of our senior lenders 
at december   our senior credit facilities provided for loans of up to million  of which million of principal related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding and million was available for future advances 
the following table summarizes our credit agreements with our senior lenders  our wholly owned and consolidated special purpose finance subsidiaries  and our senior subordinated debt and other debt  as of december  in thousands maximum amount available balance receivables based revolvers receivables based non revolvers inventory loans subtotal senior credit facilities senior subordinated debt other debt grand total we use these credit agreements to finance the sale of vacation intervals  to finance construction  and for working capital needs 
our senior credit facilities mature between june and march and are collateralized or cross collateralized by customer notes receivable  inventory  construction in process  land  improvements  and related equipment at certain of our resorts 
our fixed to floating debt ratio at december  was fixed to floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
the credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
at december   the annual prime rate on our senior credit facilities was and the one month libor rate on these facilities was 
for the year ended december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings was 
 the credit facilities secured by customer notes receivable allow advances of to of eligible customer notes receivable 
customer defaults have a significant impact on our cash available from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  we must repay borrowings against such delinquent notes 
as of december   million of notes  net of accounts charged off  were more than days past due 
in addition  we have million of senior subordinated notes due april and million of senior subordinated notes due april which are guaranteed by all of our present and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
during the year ended december   we retired million of our senior subordinated notes for million in open market transactions  which resulted in a gain of  in june  we completed an exchange transaction involving million in principal of our senior subordinated notes due for million in principal of our new class of senior subordinated notes due the primary purpose of this exchange transaction was to extend the maturity of million principal of senior subordinated notes from april  to april  concurrently with the exchange transaction  we retired an additional million in principal of our senior subordinated notes at par 
the remaining million in principal of our senior subordinated notes not included in the exchange transaction retained its original terms with semiannual interest only payments through maturity at april   at which time the remaining principal will be paid 
payment terms related to the new notes require semiannual interest only payments through july  at which time principal and interest payments of approximately million will be paid quarterly through maturity at april  
table of contents although we have no immediate growth plans  to finance our future operations  development  and any potential expansion plans  we may at some time be required to consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collateralized mortgage backed securities 
any debt we incur or issue may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as we deem prudent 
in addition  certain existing debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
our ability to pay dividends might also be restricted by the texas business organizations code 
our senior credit facilities provide certain financial covenants that we must satisfy 
any failure to comply with the financial covenants in any single loan agreement will result in a cross default under the various facilities 
such financial covenants include a profitable operations covenant which requires our consolidated net income i for any fiscal year to not be less than  ii for any two consecutive fiscal quarters  determined on an individual rather than an aggregate basis  to not be less than  and iii for any rolling month period to not be less than  and a debt service covenant which requires our ratio of i earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization  less capital expenditures as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  to ii the interest expense minus all non cash items constituting interest expense to not be less than to as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  for the latest rolling months then ending  or for the average of the last four quarters 
despite the million increase to the allowance for uncollectible notes during the third quarter of  discussed below under the caption results of operations  we remain in compliance with these covenants as of december  however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these or other financial covenants contained in our debt agreements with our senior lenders 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases construction commitments total principal maturities on our term securitizations sf ii  sf iv  silverleaf finance v  lp sf v  and silverleaf finance vi  llc sf vi are shown proportionate to the projected collections of the corresponding notes receivable that serve as collateral to this debt 
long term debt includes million of future interest  using an approximate interest rate of  which is our weighted average cost of borrowings for the year ended december  capital leases include  of future interest  using an approximate interest rate of  which is our weighted average cost of borrowings on our capital lease obligations for the year ended december  construction commitments of million relate to the continued development of our resorts and will be funded vi a availability under our credit facilities 
as of december   we had availability under our credit facilities of million 
we also have a million demand note with sf ii  our wholly owned on balance sheet conduit financing subsidiary  which equates to the total outstanding principal balance of our two conduit loans as of december  this demand note is excluded from long term debt as the note represents only a potential  future cash outlay and is eliminated on a consolidated basis 
net cash used in operating activities 
we generate cash primarily from down payments received from the sale of vacation intervals  the financing and collection of customer notes receivable from vacation interval owners  the sale of notes receivable to our special purpose entities  management fees  sampler sales  marina income  golf course and pro shop income  water park income  and hotel income 
we typically receive a to down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finance the remainder with the issuance of a seven to ten year customer promissory note 
we generate cash from customer notes receivable i by borrowing at an advance rate of to of eligible customer notes receivable  ii by selling notes receivable  and iii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because we use significant cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals but collect cash on customer notes receivable over a seven to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 

table of contents during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared to million and million during the same periods of and  respectively 
this million decrease in cash used in operating activities during versus primarily resulted from the timing of payments on accounts payable  accrued expenses  and prepaid and other assets  and the reduction in inventory expenditures for expansion at existing resorts  including construction of lodging units and additional amenities  partially offset by an increase in the growth of our gross notes receivable in the reduction in capital expenditures is consistent with our moderate growth initiative in effect for net cash used in investing activities 
during  cash used in investing activities  which represents purchases of equipment  leasehold improvements  and other general capital expenditures  was million compared to million during and million during the reduction in capital expenditures is consistent with our business plan in effect for the million net cash used during consisted of capital expenditures totaling million  partially offset by net proceeds of  received from the sale of a land parcel in texas 
the million capital expenditures resulted primarily from construction of the water park at the villages resort and purchases of unimproved real property in massac husetts and missouri 
the massachusetts land is a acre tract which adjoins acres that we own in berkshire county  massachusetts  and the missouri land consists of acres and is adjacent to our holiday hills resort in taney county  missouri 
the million cash used for investing activities in resulted primarily from the construction or expansion of member services buildings at six of our existing resorts  completion of construction on the water park at the villages resort which opened in january  and purchases of two parcels of land in texas 
we purchased approximately acres adjacent to our piney shores resort located on the shores of lake conroe  approximately miles north of houston  texas  and acres adjacent to our hill country resort  near canyon lake in the hill country of central texas between austin and san antonio 
the million cash used for investing activities in consisted primarily of additional expenditures to complete constr uction or expansion of member services buildings at two of our existing resorts 
net cash provided by financing activities 
during  financing activities provided million of net cash compared to million and million for and  respectively 
net cash provided of million in was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inventory loans  offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inventory loans 
net cash provided of million in was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inventory loans  partially offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inv entory loans  and million restricted cash reserved for payments of debt 
the securitization transaction we closed in june through our wholly owned and fully consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary  sf vi  generated million of the million of proceeds received from borrowings and million of the million of payments on borrowings for the year ended december  net cash provided of million in was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inventory loans and  of decreases in restricted cash reserved for payments of debt  partially offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and inventory loans 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in  we consummated a securitization transaction with sf iii  which is a qualified special purpose entity formed for the purpose of issuing million of timeshare loan backed notes series a in a private placement 
in connection with this transaction  we sold sf iii million in timeshare receivables that were previously pledged as collateral under revolving credit facilities with our senior lenders and sf i  our former qualified spe which was dissolved in this transaction qualified as a sale for accounting purposes 
in october  we exercised a cleanup call on the balance of the series a notes and paid off the sf iii credit facility 
the total payment of million consisted of the principal balance of the series a notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and other fees through october  we dissolved sf iii simultaneously with the execution of the cleanup call 
we did not record a gain or loss as a result of the dissolution as our investment in sf iii was carried on our books at fair value 
see note regarding the dissolution of sf iii 
the series a notes were secured by timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii  without recourse  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement  we continued to service these timeshare receivables and received fees for our services equal to of eligible timeshare receiv ables held by the facility 
such fees were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
except for the repurchase of notes that failed to meet initial eligibility requirements  we were not obligated to repurchase defaulted or any other contracts sold to sf iii 
as the servicer of notes receivable sold to sf iii  we were obligated to foreclose upon vacation intervals securing defaulted note receivables 
although we were not obligated  we could purchase foreclosed vacation intervals for net fair market value  which could not be less than fifteen percent of the original acquisition price that the customer paid for the vacation interval 
for the years ended december    and  we paid million   and million  respectively  to repurchase the vacation intervals securing defaulted contracts to facilitate the re marketing of those vacation intervals 

table of contents in accordance with fasb asc transfers and servicing  our bases for classifying sf iii as a qualified spe were i sf iii was demonstrably distinct from the transferor as dissolution of the spe would have required an affirmative vote of of the spe s board of directors  one of which had to be independent  ii prescribed restrictions on permitted activities sufficiently limited the spe s authority  and iii financial assets transferred to the spe were passive in nature 
our spes provide us with additional credit availability under our facilities with our current senior lenders 
as we require credit facilities to provide liquidity necessary to fund our costs and expenses  it is vitally important to our liquidity plan to have financing available to us in order to continue to finance the majority of our timeshare sales over seven to ten years 
income taxes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  we report substantially all of the vacation interval sales we finance under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest is imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the payment is received 
if we are not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not reasonably estimable 
as we expect to realize our deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis  we do not currently have a valuation reserve for deferred taxes 
as of december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits  and as a result  no benefits that would affect our effective income tax rate 
we do not anticipate any significant changes related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next months 
as of december   we did not require an accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we are subject to current amt as a result of the deferred income that results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt creates a deferred tax asset in the form of a minimum tax credit  which  unless otherwise limited  reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales 
this deferred tax asset has an unlimited carryover period 
the amt credit can be utilized to the extent regular tax exceeds amt tax liability for a given year 
due to amt losses in certain years prior to  which offset all amt income for years prior to  no minimum tax credit exists for years prior to however  amt has been paid in subsequent years and is anticipated in future periods 
federal nols of million existing at december  expire between and realization of the deferred tax assets arising from nols is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
due to a corporate restructuring  an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code the code occurred 
as a result  a portion of our nol is subject to an annual limitation for the current and future taxable years 
this annual limitation may be increased for any recognized built in gain to the extent allowed in section h of the code 
the current annual limitation of  represents the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
we believe that million of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december  were subject to the section limitations 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes key ratios from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and as a percentage of total revenues vacation interval sales estimated uncollectible revenue net sales interest income management fee income other income total revenues as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of vacation interval sales sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenues operating  general and administrative depreciation as a percentage of interest income interest expense and lender fees results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a million  or  decrease compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  as discussed below  the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in vacation interval sales and a million increase in estimated uncollectible revenue  partially offset by a million increase in interest income during the year ended december  the following table summarizes our vacation interval sales for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  except average price sales intervals average price sales intervals average price interval sales to new customers upgrade interval sales to existing customers additional interval sales to existing customers total vacation interval sales decreased in versus primarily due to promotional pricing offered during on select products  partially offset by a favorable sales mix of higher end products on additional interval sales to existing customers 
the number of interval sales to new customers decreased and average prices decreased  which resulted in an decrease in sales to new customers in versus the number of upgrade interval sales to existing customers increased but average prices decreased  resulting in a net increase in upgrade interval sales to existing customers during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the number of additional interval sales to existing customers decreased but average prices increa sed  resulting in a net decrease in additional interval sales to existing customers during versus vacation interval sales to existing owners comprised and of total vacation interval sales in the years ended december  and  respectively  which continues our favorable sales mix trend toward sales with relatively lower associated sales and marketing costs

recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements and disclosures fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this accounting standard is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
it does not expand or require any new fair value measures 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures for one year  from janu ary  to january   relative to non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
accordingly  our adoption of this standard on january  was limited to financial assets and liabilities  which primarily affected the disclosures for the investment in our spe and our derivative contracts as shown in note this adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
on january   we adopted the remaining aspects of the accounting standard  which apply to our non financial long lived assets land  equipment  buildings  and leasehold improvements which are measured at fair value based on a periodic impairment assessment 
this adoption resulted in additional disclosures for land  equipment  buildings  and leasehold improvements  which are included herein  however the adoption of this accounting standard for these as sets did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in april  the fasb provided additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
this guidance reaffirms the objective of fair value measurement  which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale 
it also reaffirms the need to use judgment to determine if a formerly active market has become inactive  as well as to determine fair values when markets have become inactive 
this update to fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures was effective prospectively for reporting periods ending after ju ne  the adoption of this update in the second quarter of did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
derivatives and hedging we adopted the amendment to fasb asc derivatives and hedging on january  this amendment expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb asc derivatives and hedging  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the adoption of this accounting standard on january  did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
disclosures regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities are included in note and in disclosures related to interest rate risk and market risk 
interim disclosures fair value of financial instruments we adopted the amendment to fasb asc interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in the second quarter of this amendment requires the existing disclosure requirements related to the fair value of financial instruments be extended to interim periods that were previously only required in annual financial statements 
the adoption of this accounting standard in the second quarter of did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
additional disclosures were included in our form q for both the second and third quarters of subsequent events we adopted fasb asc subsequent events in the second quarter of this accounting standard establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
consistent with the requirements of this accounting standard for public entities  we evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued 
fasb asc subsequent events should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports  either through recognition or disclosure  in its financial statements 
the adoption of this accounting standard in the second quarter of did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the fasb amended this accounting guidance in march  effective immediately  to exclude public entities from the requirement to disclose the date on which subsequent events have been evaluated 
in addition  the amendment modified the requirement to disclose the date on which subsequent events have been evaluated in reissued financial statements to apply only to such statements that have been restated to correct an error or to apply us gaap retrospectively 
as a res ult of this amendment  we did not disclose the date through which we evaluated subsequent events in this report on form k 
accounting for transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued fasb asc accounting for transfers of financial assets  which i eliminated the concept of a qualified spe  ii clarified the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  iii clarified the unit of account eligible for sale accounting  and iv required that a transferor initially measure at fair value and recognize all assets obtained for example beneficial interests and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or group of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
additionally  on and after the effective date  existing qualified spes as defined under previous accounting standards must be evaluated for consoli dation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
fasb asc accounting for transfers of financial assets further requires enhanced disclosures  including a transferor s continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales  the risks inherent in the transferred financial assets that have been retained  and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the transferor s assets that continue to be reported in the statement of financial position 
this accounting standard will be effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  the adoption of this standard will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows as we exercised a cleanup call on the balance of the series a notes previously sold by sf iii effective october  the cleanup call resulted in the dissolution of sf iii 

table of contents consolidation of variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued fasb asc amendments to fasb asc consolidation of variable interest entities 
this amendment changes the consolidation guidance applicable to spes 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of an spe and therefore required to consolidate the spe by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis includes  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefit s of the spe that could potentially be significant to the spe 
this accounting standard further requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of an spe  whereas such reassessments were previously required only when specific events had occurred 
in addition  qualified spes  which were previously exempt from the application of fasb asc consolidation of variable interest entities  will be subject to the provisions of this amendment 
the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with an spe 
this accounting standard will be effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  the adoption of this standard on january   will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows as we have ownership in our fully consolidated spes sf ii  sf iv  sf v  and sf vi 
 in addition  we exercised a cleanup call on the balance of the series a notes previously sold to sf iii  our wholly owned off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  effective october  which resulted in the dissolution of sf iii 
fasb accounting standards codification in june  the fasb issued fasb asc the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the fasb accounting standards codification has become the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap 
all existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the fasb asc and any accounting literature not included in the fasb asc will not be authoritative 
however  rules a nd interpretive releases of the sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
this accounting standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  therefore  beginning with our third quarter report on form q  all references made to gaap in our consolidated financial statements now reference the new fasb asc 
this accounting standard does not change or alter existing gaap and  therefore  did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general interest on our notes receivable portfolio  senior subordinated debt  capital leases  and miscellaneous notes is fixed  whereas interest on our primary loan agreements  which had a total facility amount of million at december   have a fixed to floating debt ratio of fixed to floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
at december   the carrying value of our notes receivable portfolio approximates fair value because the weighted average interest rate on the portfolio approximates current interest rates received on similar notes 
our fixed rate notes receivable are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in fair value if market rates increase  which may negatively impact our ability to sell our fixed rate notes in the marketplace 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk related to our notes receivable 
we offer financing to the buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
these buyers generally make a down payment of to of the purchase price and deliver a promissory note to us for the balance 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are payable over a seven to ten year period  and are secured by a deed of trust on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of defaults on these promissory notes 
although we prescreen prospects via credit scoring techniques in the early stages of the marketing and sales process  we generally do not perform a detailed credit history review of our customers 
due to the state of the economy in general  and related deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
because we use various mass marketing techniques  a certain percentage of our sales are generated from customers who may be considered to have marginal credit quality 
in addition  we have experienced an increase in defaults in our loan portfolio as compared to historical rates 
due to existing economic conditions  there can be no assurance that defaults have stabilized or will not increase further 
customer default levels  other adverse changes in the credit markets  and related uncertain economic conditions may eliminate or reduce the availability or increase the cost of significant sources of funding for us in the future 
we increased our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales to for from for however  if def ault rates for our borrowers were to continue to rise  it may require an additional increase in our estimated uncollectible revenue 
we will continue to evaluate our collections process and marketing programs with a view toward establishing procedures aimed at reducing note defaults and improving the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
if a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we generally must foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it  the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered  and such costs must be incurred again to resell the vacation interval 
although in many cases we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid note balance  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
accordingly  we have generally not pursued this remedy 

table of contents interest rate risk we have historically derived net interest income from our financing activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals exceed the interest rates we pay to our senior lenders 
as of our senior indebtedness bears interest at variable rates and our customer notes receivable bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that we have historically experienced and could cause our interest expense on borrowings to exceed our interest income on our portfolio of customer loans 
although interest rates remained fairly constant throughout  any increase in interest rates above applicable floor rates  particularly if susta ined  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
a hypothetical one point interest rate increase in the marketplace at december  would result in a fair value decrease of approximately million on our notes receivable portfolio 
the impact of a one point effective interest rate change on the million balance of variable rate debt instruments at december  would be approximately  on our results of operations  after income taxes  for the year ended december   or approximately per diluted common share 
to partially offset potential increases in interest rates  we have executed two interest rate swaps related to our conduit loan with sf ii  with fixed rates of and  for a total notional amount of million at december  such interest rate swaps relate to agreements that expire between september and march our variable funding note with sf iv also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap 
the balance outstanding under this line of credit at december  was million 
in february  the maturity date of such variable funding note was extended to february  as discussed in note  subsequent events 
availability of funding sources we fund substantially all of our notes receivable  timeshare inventories  and land inventories which we originate or purchase with borrowings through our financing facilities  sales of notes receivable  internally generated funds  and proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds we receive from collections on such notes receivable 
to the extent that we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings  we would have to curtail our operations or sell assets  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
geographic concentration our notes receivable and vacation interval inventories are primarily originated in texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida 
risks inherent in such concentrations are regional and general economic stability  which affects property values and the financial stability of the borrowers  and the continued popularity of our resort destinations  which affects the marketability of our products and the collection of notes receivable
