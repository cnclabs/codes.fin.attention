item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and functional measurement  or fm  products 
we believe that these products enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular heart disease by improving the efficiency and efficacy of existing percutaneous interventional  or pci  therapy procedures in the coronary or peripheral arteries 
we market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
our products consist of multi modality consoles which are marketed as stand alone units or as customized units that can be integrated into a variety of hospital based interventional surgical suites called catheterization laboratories  or cath labs 
we have developed customized cath lab versions of these consoles and are developing additional functionality options as part of our cath lab integration initiative 
our consoles have been designed to serve as a multi modality platform for our phased array and rotational ivus catheters  fractional flow reserve  or ffr  pressure wires and medtronic s pioneer reentry device 
we are developing additional offerings for integration into the platform  including  forward looking ivus  or fl 
ivus  catheters  image guided therapy catheters and ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography  or oct  systems and catheters 
our ivus products include single procedure disposable phased array and rotational ivus imaging catheters and additional functionality options such as vh ivus tissue characterization and chromaflo stent apposition analysis 
our fm offerings include fm consoles and single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque enabling physicians to gauge the plaque s physiological impact on blood flow and pressure 
we also develop and manufacture optical monitors  lasers  and optical engines used in oct imaging systems as well as micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors used in the telecommunications industry 
we have corporate infrastructure in the us  europe and japan  direct sales capabilities in the us  and a combination of direct sales capabilities and distribution relationships in our primary international markets  including japan  europe  the middle east  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
our corporate office is located in san diego  california 
our worldwide manufacturing and research and development operations are located in rancho cordova  california 
we also have additional research and development facilities in cleveland  ohio  forsyth county  georgia and san diego  california 
we have sales offices in alpharetta  georgia and tokyo  japan  sales and distribution offices in zaventem  belgium and woodmead  south africa  and third party distribution facilities in chiba  japan and tokyo  japan 
in addition  we have facilities in 
table of contents billerica  massachusetts for the manufacturing and operations of axsun technologies  inc  or axsun  our wholly owned subsidiary  and the research and development of oct and fl 
ivus technology 
in june  we implemented a restructuring plan which we expect to complete by march  to close our facility in san antonio  texas and consolidate our oct resources into our billerica  massachusetts facility 
we have focused on building our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
at december   we had employees worldwide  including manufacturing employees  sales and marketing employees and research and development employees 
we sell our products directly to customers in certain european markets and utilize distributors in other european markets  including spain  portugal and parts of italy 
beginning in the third quarter of  we primarily sell our products directly to customers in japan see recent developments  direct sales strategy in japan below 
we also have direct contractual relationships with fukuda denshi co  ltd  or fukuda denshi  and johnson johnson kk  cordis division  or johnson johnson  through which our ivus products are distributed in japan 
in certain markets  including the major markets of asia pacific  latin america  europe  australia  africa and the middle east  we have distributor relationships through which we sell our products 
our distributors are involved in product launch planning  education and training  physician support and clinical trial management 
at december   we had a worldwide installed base of over  consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
in the year ended december   the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues  a million  or increase from  in which the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues 
we manufacture our multi modality and fm consoles  ivus catheters and fm guide wires at our facility in rancho cordova  california 
we use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards and mechanical sub assemblies used in the manufacture of our consoles 
we also use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the manufacture of our single procedure disposable products 
we perform incoming inspection on these circuit boards  mechanical sub assemblies and components  assemble them into finished products  and test the final product to assure quality control 
we completed an underwritten initial public offering on june  that resulted in net proceeds of million  an underwritten follow on offering on december  that resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  and an underwritten follow on offering on october  that resulted in net proceeds to the company of million 
during the second half of and the first quarter of  we pursued an acquisition with an interventional therapy company 
given the other entity s complex legal structure  global revenue base and lack of us gaap financial statements  the due diligence and deal related costs were significant 
we were not able to reach a final definitive agreement and  during the year ended december   we expensed approximately million in third party costs incurred during the due diligence process 
on december   we acquired cardiospectra  inc  or cardiospectra 
as a result  we are developing innovative oct technology  which is expected to complement our existing product offerings and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine 
oct technology enables high resolution imaging of highly detailed structures in the vasculature  including vessel wall defects  intra luminal thrombus and stent struts 
our long term goal is to integrate this oct functionality into our s family of imaging products 
on may   we acquired novelis  inc  or novelis  a company with proprietary ultrasonic visualization and therapy technology for minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic devices 
our acquisition 
table of contents of novelis proprietary fl 
ivus technology platform is expected to help us build upon our existing suite of products and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine by enabling fl 
ivus and associated therapies in the interventional cardiology market 
we expect to add these products and capability onto our s family of imaging products 
on december   we acquired axsun technologies  inc  a company that develops and manufactures optical monitors for telecommunications  lasers and optical engines used in medical oct imaging systems and advanced photonic components and sub systems used in spectroscopy and other industrial applications 
we believe axsun s proprietary oct technology will provide us competitive advantages in the invasive imaging sector 
following the axsun acquisition  we and axsun were sued by lightlab imaging  inc  or lightlab  see note commitments and contingencies  litigation to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our dispute with lightlab 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in and to million in our operating loss was million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the acquisition of cardiospectra 
our operating loss decreased to million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the novelis acquisition 
our operating loss increased to million in  which included an million charge related to in process research and development for a milestone of the cardiospectra acquisition and a million charge related to in process research and development for a milestone of the novelis acquisition 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since our inception  we have not been profitable for a full fiscal year 
in the years ended december   and    and  respectively  of our revenues and   and  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in various non us dollar currencies  primarily the euro and the yen 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses will continue to be denominated in non us dollar currencies 
as a result  we are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operating results in the future 
economic conditions have continued to deteriorate significantly in many countries and regions  including without limitation the us  and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
if our customers do not obtain or do not have access to the necessary capital to operate their businesses  or are otherwise adversely affected by the deterioration in national and worldwide economic conditions  this could result in reductions in the sales of our products  longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies by our customers  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  our customers and suppliers liquidity  capital resources and credit may be adversely affected by the current financial and credit crisis  which could adversely affect our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and lengthen our collection cycles  or limit our timely access to important sources of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our consoles and catheters 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial or credit markets will improve the national and worldwide economic conditions in the near term 
recent developments prospect study results 
in september  results from the providing regional observations to study predictors of events in the coronary tree  or prospect  trial  a natural history study sponsored by abbott vascular  a division of abbott laboratories  and co funded by us  demonstrated that the measurements made using grayscale and vh ivus had a statistically significant impact on study participants in determining the likelihood of a particular lesion type to cause a major adverse cardiac event  or mace 
specifically  the highest risk prospect plaque type  vh thin cap fibroatheromas  or vh tcfas  with a minimum lumen area of less than or equal to mm and plaque burden greater than or equal to were identified as having a chance of causing a mace within three years 
we believe the results of the prospect study demonstrate that vh ivus has positive predictive value to identify high risk plaques which supports more stenting in lesions not 
table of contents currently stented and negative predictive value to identify low risk plaques which reduces stenting for those particular lesions 
we believe this negative predictive value enables more targeted procedures and will contribute to the further adoption of our ivus products 
fame study results 
in september  published findings from the fractional flow reserve versus angiography for multivessel evaluation  or fame  study demonstrated the potential of ffr in improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs 
the fame study s results over a two year period demonstrated that patients in the study with multi vessel coronary artery disease who were treated by ffr guidance had a reduction in death and myocardial infarction compared to angiographic guidance alone 
the fame study also demonstrated that adhering to an ffr guided regimen for multi vessel disease can potentially provide cost benefits to the hospital and payers by reducing procedural costs and lowering average length of hospitalization 
we believe these findings will continue to drive the growth and adoption of our disposable ffr wire products 
direct sales strategy in japan 
historically  we sold our products in japan primarily through distributors 
during the third quarter of  we accelerated our direct sales strategy  our efforts to place and sell our products directly through an internal sales force  in japan and we formally ended our distribution relationship with goodman 
on july   we entered into a distributor termination agreement  or termination agreement  with goodman that terminated certain agreements between us and goodman effective august   and provided for the transition of the distribution of volcano products in japan to volcano japan co 
ltd  or volcano japan 
we believe that the termination of this relationship enables us to provide more focused service and support to the japanese market  creates more favorable economics  including higher operating margins on the sale of volcano products in japan  and provides the ability for us to direct our own sales and marketing initiatives in japan 
under the termination agreement  we paid goodman million japanese yen and consumption tax a total of approximately million during the third quarter of and goodman transferred and delivered consoles owned by goodman to us 
in addition  we recorded approximately million in expense related to commissions we agreed to pay goodman as part of the transition plan 
these commissions were paid on various dates through and the final payment was made during january as a result of the termination  we have incurred additional expenses sooner than initially planned 
our efforts to successfully implement a direct sales strategy in japan or the failure to achieve our sales objectives in japan may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
for additional information regarding the risks of our goodman termination  see risk factors if our transition to a direct sales force in japan is not successful  then our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the aforementioned amounts related to the termination agreement have been converted to us dollars from japanese yen based on exchange rates in effect in august  except for the commission expense which was converted using actual exchange rates in effect during the period 
financial operations overview the following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses 
revenues 
we derive our revenues from two reporting segments medical and telecommunications  or telecom 
our medical segment represents our core business  in which we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our consoles and single procedure disposables 
our telecom segment derives revenues related to the sales of axsun s micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors to telecommunication companies 
in the year ended december   we generated million of revenues which is composed of million from our medical segment and million from our telecom segment 
we experienced increases in revenues related to ivus and fm single procedure disposables from compared with  while console sales remained relatively flat year over year 
in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our consoles  as compared with in the year ended december  in the year ended december   ivus single procedure disposables accounted for of our medical segment revenues  compared to in  while in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our fm single procedure disposables  as compared with in the year ended december  other revenues consist primarily of service and maintenance revenues  
table of contents shipping and handling revenues  sales of distributed products  spare parts sales  and license fees 
goodman accounted for less than   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our quarterly revenues from console sales due in part to the timing of hospital capital equipment purchasing decisions 
further  we expect variability of our revenues based on the timing of our new product introductions  which may cause our customers to delay their purchasing decisions until the new products are commercially available 
alternatively  we may include in our arrangements with customers future deliverables  such as unspecified hardware upgrades or training 
in these cases  we would be required to defer associated revenues from these customers until we have met our future deliverables obligation 
our medical segment sales in the us are generated by our direct sales representatives and our products are shipped to hospitals throughout the us from our facilities in rancho cordova  california and billerica  massachusetts 
our medical segment international sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and are shipped throughout the world from our facilities in rancho cordova  california  billerica  massachusetts  zaventem  belgium  chiba  japan  tokyo  japan  and woodmead  south africa 
our telecom segment sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and these products are shipped to telecommunications companies domestically and abroad from our facility in billerica  massachusetts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs for the products that we sell and other costs associated with our manufacturing process  such as personnel costs  rent  depreciation and utilities 
in addition  cost of revenues includes depreciation of company owned consoles  royalty expenses for licensed technologies included in our products  service costs  provisions for warranty  distribution  freight and packaging costs and stock based compensation expense 
we expect our gross margin for ivus and fm products to improve over time if we are successful in our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve our manufacturing processes and increase production volumes 
we expect our overall gross margins to decrease due to the acquisition of axsun and the lower gross margin generated by their product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the sales  marketing  executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include travel and entertainment expenses  facility costs  trade show  training and other promotional expenses  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock based compensation expense 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing efforts and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support our continued growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  consultants  prototype materials  clinical studies  depreciation  regulatory filing fees  certain legal costs related to our intellectual property and stock based compensation expense 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products  technologies and applications 
in process research and development 
in process research and development  or ipr d  consists of our projects acquired in connection with acquisitions that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of each acquisition date 
certain additional payments that may be required in connection with our acquisitions could result in future charges to ipr d 
in december  we acquired the oct project in connection with our acquisition of cardiospectra  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval remained to be completed as of the acquisition date at an estimated cost of million 
in december  we achieved a milestone specified in the cardiospectra merger agreement related to the receipt of ce mark regulatory approval and million became 
table of contents payable by us to the former stockholders of cardiospectra 
although we have received ce mark approval for a preliminary version of our oct product  this version is not intended to be commercialized 
we believe there is significant incremental effort and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization and there is significant risk that a commercializable product may not result from our efforts 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to complete the oct project for a total of approximately million 
the oct project was originally expected to be commercialized by late  however the oct project was at an earlier stage of development than our initial assessment indicated 
as of december   commercialization is not expected until early accordingly  we have recorded million to ipr d expense related to the milestone for the year ended december  additional milestone payments of up to million may be paid in connection with successful and timely regulatory approvals and commercialization 
if the oct project is not completed in a timely manner  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize a potential competitive position  experience difficulties in obtaining our forecasted revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay some or all of the milestone payments 
in may  we acquired the fl 
ivus project in connection with our acquisition of novelis  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval protocols remained to be completed for the fl 
ivus project as of the acquisition date  at an estimated cost of million 
in december  we recorded million of additional ipr d expense related to the probable achievement of a regulatory approval for the fl 
ivus project 
this represents a contractual milestone payment to be made to the former stockholders of novelis 
we expect to receive this regulatory approval in the first quarter of however  we believe there is significant incremental effort and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to commercialize the first product using fl 
ivus for a total of million 
we originally expected the fl 
ivus project to receive regulatory approvals and be commercialized during as of december   the project was behind schedule by approximately one year 
if the fl 
ivus project is not completed in a timely manner  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize our competitive position and experience a potential loss of revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay the milestone payment 
in november  we acquired an ipr d project in connection with our acquisition of impact medical technologies  llc  a minor acquisition  valued at approximately  the following table summarizes our significant ipr d projects in millions costs incurred since acquisition estimated cost to complete  as of december  total estimated costs to complete since acquisition date as of acquisition date project name fair value estimated cost to complete oct flivus amortization of intangibles 
intangible assets  which consist of our developed technology  licenses  customer relationships  patents and trademarks  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
interest income 
interest income is comprised of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents and our short term available for sale investments 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on capital lease obligations 

table of contents exchange rate gain 
exchange rate gain is comprised of foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses  net  and the effect of changes in value and net settlements of our foreign exchange forward contracts 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes is comprised of state  local and foreign income taxes 
we have evaluated our ability to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
for those jurisdictions in which we believe there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no current benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established at december  and to reflect these uncertainties 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and our state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely 
we also have federal research and experimentation tax credits  which begin to expire in  and state research and experimentation tax credits  which carry forward indefinitely

comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to revenues of million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   revenues related to ivus single procedure disposables increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december   while revenues related to fm single procedure disposables increased million or in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues related to console sales in the year ended december  were relatively flat as compared to the same period last year  as increases in console placements were partially offset by shifts in our customer mix 
overall  our revenue increases were driven by an increase in the number of pcis performed  resulting in increased utilization of our single procedure disposable products 
additionally  the increases in fm disposable revenues were primarily due to the broader availability of ffr technology as this functionality has been incorporated into our multi modality console  in conjunction with an increased adoption of the technology based on recent clinical study data 
telecom segment revenues were million in the year ended december  we had  of telecom segment revenues in the year ended december  as we acquired axsun on december  other revenues increased million  or  due primarily to higher service contract and rental revenues and the inclusion of axsun medical segment revenues in the period  partially offset by lower sales of distributed products 
increases in revenues were realized across all our key geographic markets 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   from million  or of revenues in the year ended december  gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   down from of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the cost of revenues was primarily due to higher sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the addition of lower margin products from axsun  higher console depreciation and higher field service costs 
these unfavorable gross margin impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the production costs of ivus and fm disposable products due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives and higher manufacturing capacity utilization 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to growth in our japan operation to support our direct sales efforts there  increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our us and europe sales organizations  legal expenses related to the lightlab litigation  commission expenses related to the termination of our relationship with goodman  increased infrastructure expenses to support company growth  inclusion of a full year of expenses from ongoing operations of axsun and higher stock based compensation expense 
we acquired axsun in december   therefore the year ended december  did not include significant expenses related to axsun 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in due diligence expenses that were incurred in the year ended december  related to an acquisition that was not consummated 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses from ongoing operations of novelis and axsun  increased personnel related costs  increased spending on various product development projects and increased clinical trial and regulatory expenses 
we acquired axsun in december  therefore the year ended december  did not include significant expenses related to axsun 
we acquired novelis was acquired in may therefore the year ended december  included approximately seven months of expenses relating to novelis 
in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to a milestone of our oct project acquired from cardiospectra and million related to a milestone of our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis 
ipr d expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to the acquisition of novelis 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense increased to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired from axsun 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our investments and a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was entirely due to a reduction in balances of our capital lease obligations 
interest expense during the years ended december  and primarily related to our capital lease obligations 

table of contents exchange rate gain 
exchange rate gain for the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation of the euro and the yen relative to the us dollar and its related effect on the intercompany receivables between volcano corporation and volcano europe and volcano japan 
exchange rate gain was also favorably impacted by gains related to our foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of the hedging program we implemented during the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  compared to a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes consisted primarily of foreign income taxes and domestic state and local income taxes 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to revenues of million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   revenues related to sales of ivus single procedure disposables increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   revenues related to fm single procedure disposables increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  console sales in the year ended december  increased by million  or  over revenues from console sales in the year ended december  other revenues increased million  or  due primarily to higher shipping and handling revenues  increased ivus console rentals  partially offset by decreases in sales of distributed products following the termination of the distribution agreement with ev  inc the increases in shipping and handling revenues were related to higher sales volumes 
the increases in ivus and fm revenues were primarily due to growth in the overall ivus and fm markets and the launch of new products 
in addition  revenues in the year ended december  were favorably impacted by million in foreign currency translation  when compared to the year ended december  increases in revenues were realized across all our key geographic markets 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   from million  or of revenues in the year ended december  gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   up from of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the cost of revenues was primarily due to higher sales volume 
the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from an increase in the average selling prices of ivus and fm disposables and a decrease in production costs of disposables products due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives and higher manufacturing capacity utilization  partially offset by higher distribution  service and depreciation costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our sales force  higher marketing expenses largely the result of an increase in promotional activities and customer training expense  increased infrastructure expenses  million in due diligence expenses that were incurred in the year ended december  relating to an acquisition that was not consummated and higher stock based compensation expense 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  was primarily due to higher costs associated with development of our oct and fl 
ivus products  increased stock based compensation expense and increased clinical and regulatory costs in japan 

table of contents in process research and development 
in process research and development expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to the acquisition of novelis 
in process research and development expenses of million in the year ended december  related to the acquisition of cardiospectra 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense was relatively unchanged at million  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  primarily related to the acquisitions of novelis and axsun  and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our investments 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was entirely due to a reduction in debt balances 
interest expense during the year ended december  primarily related to our capital leases 
exchange rate gain 
exchange rate gain for the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase related primarily to the impact of the change in the us dollar to euro exchange rate on the intercompany receivable between volcano corporation and volcano europe 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes consisted primarily of foreign income taxes and domestic state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity historically  our sources of cash have included proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  including underwritten public offerings of our common stock  cash generated from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  cash generated from operations  primarily from the collection of accounts receivable resulting from product sales  and interest income 
our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs  expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency  capital expenditures related to the acquisition of equipment that we own and place at our customer premises and other fixed assets  cash used to repay our debt obligations and related interest expense  and cash used for acquisitions 

table of contents fluctuations in our working capital due to timing differences of our cash receipts and cash disbursements also impact our cash inflows and outflows 
we completed an underwritten initial public offering on june  that resulted in net proceeds of million  an underwritten follow on offering on december  that resulted in net proceeds of million  and an underwritten follow on offering on october  that resulted in net proceeds of million 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments totaled million 
we invest our excess funds in short term securities issued by corporations  banks  the us government  municipalities  and financial holding companies and in money market funds comprised of us treasury and agency securities 
we do not hold securities backed by mortgages 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since inception  we have generated significant operating losses and as a result we have not generated sufficient operating cash flow to fund our operations and the growth in our business 
accordingly  prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations and acquisitions primarily through the issuances of million of preferred stock  million of senior subordinated notes and million of term loans 
these issuances of equity and debt were supplemented with borrowings from a revolving credit facility and equipment financing arrangements 
the issuances of our senior subordinated notes  term loans and revolving credit facility included warrants to purchase our series b preferred stock  which automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering  or our common stock 
in may our revolving credit facility expired as scheduled 
in connection with our acquisition of axsun in december  we assumed debt in the amount of  the debt was subsequently repaid in january cash flows years ended december  net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million and non cash investment amortization of  in addition  uses of cash include increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and a decrease of accounts payable of million

table of contents future liquidity needs our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to medical diagnostic equipment that we own and place at our customers premises  our facilities expansion needs  including costs of leasing additional facilities and associated tenant improvements  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  upgrades to our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and improve overall productivity  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources in the us and abroad  particularly in japan where our strategy is to continue to pursue a direct sales model  the continued advancement of research and development activities  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  and acquisitions of technologies that enhance our capabilities or compliment our markets 
our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
at december   we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and our short term available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and operations for at least the next months 
we intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital required to support our sales growth  the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  our sales and marketing programs  the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies and changes in the market and regulatory environment 
our ability to fund our longer term cash needs is subject to various risks  many of which are beyond our control see risk factors we may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
should we require additional funding  such as additional capital investments  we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income if we become profitable 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  use of net operating loss carryforwards related to acquisitions of approximately million is limited 
we expect to utilize our available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations in the event we are successful in achieving profitability 
however  future limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other minimum state taxes may increase our overall tax obligations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification to business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
at december   we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
in october  we signed a clinical research support agreement with a third party in which the third party will conduct clinical studies concerning drug eluting stents 
we have agreed to provide a total of million to fund clinical study activities 
at december   we have a remaining obligation of up to million and we will be billed as services are performed under the agreement 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with other third parties to sponsor clinical studies 
generally  we contract with one or more clinical research sites for a single study and no one agreement is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we are usually billed as services are performed based on enrollment and are required to make payments over periods ranging from less than one year up to three years 
our actual payments under these agreements will vary based on enrollment 
at december   we estimate our contractual obligations related to these clinical studies are approximately million over the next three years 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  for each of the periods indicated in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase commitments total we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in the us as well as locations in europe and asia 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases at december  consists of non cancelable commitments primarily for the purchase of production materials 
the table above does not include milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million which may be due to the former shareholders of cardiospectra see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements upon the achievement of certain milestones and may  at our election  be payable in either cash or stock  and up to an estimated million in payments for clinical studies which are billed as services are performed see above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become 
table of contents even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the terms of which are generally free on board shipping point 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables  and for these we apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  multiple element arrangements 
we are required to make judgments which impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
for example  because the sale of our products and services are often contemplated in a single arrangement  we make judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from the arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  our ability to establish and maintain objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the elements in our arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
the elements of a typical revenue arrangement can include a console  options for the console  single procedure disposable products and a service and maintenance agreement 
we occasionally enter into agreements requiring cash payments to partners who are also customers 
we apply the provisions of asc topic  customer payments and incentives  to account for cash payments made under these agreements 
fair value we record our short term available for sale investments at fair value 
at december   our cash and short term available for sale investments totaled million 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note financial statement details to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
valuations using level and inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation 
we utilize a third party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments 
while pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models  the inputs used are based on observable market information  therefore we have classified our inputs as level and level we do not value any of our short term available for sale investments using level inputs 
we also record our foreign exchange forward contracts at fair value 
at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was recorded as assets totaling  we utilize a third party broker to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these instruments 
we classified these fair value inputs as level 
table of contents inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to obsolescence and reductions in estimated future demand 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are generally three to five years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  which is generally between three and ten years 
the straight line method is used for depreciation and amortization 
intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology  customer relationships  licenses  and patents and trademarks  which are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to ten years  representing the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on our new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life  generally ten years 
acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
we believe the useful lives we assigned to these assets are reasonable 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
intangible assets  consisting of acquired technology  licenses  patents and trademarks  and customer relationships  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
asc requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
acquisitions which cause us to recognize goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations that involve estimates and judgments about the value and recoverability of those assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less 
table of contents than their carrying value 
if less than their carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to long lived assets require us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated which requires significant judgment 
actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
foreign currency translation on july   we adopted the japanese yen as the functional currency for volcano japan 
consistent with the considerations specified in fasb asc topic  foreign currency matters  or asc  the change was made to reflect recent developments with our japan operations  including increases in direct sales denominated in the japanese yen and growth in the local infrastructure that has enabled the day to day operations of volcano japan to become relatively self contained and integrated into the japanese economic environment 
in accordance with asc  assets and liabilities of volcano japan s operations are translated into us dollars at period end exchange rates  revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period  and adjustments resulting from the translation are reported on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
due to the complexities and variability of foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and japanese yen  we are not able to estimate the financial effect this change will have on our future results of operations 
on october   approximately million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan was converted into a long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
our determination of the amount of long term investment that would not be repaid for the foreseeable future is judgmental in nature and involved significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows 
actual results may vary 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date 
we adopted asc on january  using the modified prospective method 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight line method 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock based compensation expense 
we have used the black scholes model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected option life 
if we had made different assumptions  the amount of our deferred stock based compensation  stock based compensation expense  gross margin  net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions to determine the fair value of our common stock and that deferred stock based compensation and related amortization were recorded properly for accounting purposes 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
for example  we granted stock options for  shares of our common stock during the year ended december  using our assumptions  we calculated approximately million of stock compensation expense related to these awards that will be amortized over four years 
given a ten percent change in our volatility assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately million 
given a one hundred basis point change in our risk free interest rate assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately million 
given a one year change in our expected option life assumption  the value of these awards would have 
table of contents differed by approximately million 
in addition  given a one hundred basis point change in our weighted average forfeiture rate assumption  our stock compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  would have differed by approximately  we apply the provisions of fasb asc topic  equity based payments to non employees  and use the black scholes model to determine the fair value of each option grant to non employees 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the realization of our deferred tax assets  which had a gross carrying value of million at december   is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
within the us and selected international jurisdictions  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our past and future performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of tax attributes in the past  and the length of carryforward periods and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance in the us and selected international jurisdictions until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable in the respective jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
asu updates guidance on how entities account for revenue arrangements that contain both hardware and software elements 
asu and asu are effective for us on january  and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted asu and asu prospectively on january  together  we expect these changes are likely to result in earlier recognition of revenue for our multiple element arrangements than under previous guidance  however we do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued amendments to fasb asc topic  business combinations  or asc  which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from pre acquisition contingencies be recognized at fair value  in accordance with asc  if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
if the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period  the contingency shall be recognized at the acquisition date in accordance with fasb asc topic  contingencies 
we will apply the guidance of asc  as amended  to all of our future business combinations 

table of contents inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments consisting of highly liquid financial investments with original maturities of one year or less 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european and japanese operations 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
during the year ended december   and of our revenues were denominated in the yen and euro  respectively  and and of our operating expenses were denominated in the yen and euro  respectively 
during the year ended december   revenues were unfavorably impacted by the valuation of the euro and favorably impacted by the valuation of the yen  as compared to the us dollar 
in periods of a strengthening us dollar  our results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods could be negatively impacted 
exchange rate fluctuations resulting from the translation of the inter company balances between volcano corporation  our us entity  and volcano japan  and volcano corporation and volcano europe  and other non us dollar denominated liabilities into non us dollars are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses and are included in exchange rate gain in the consolidated statement of operations 
on october   approximately million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan was converted into a long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
in april  million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano europe was converted into equity  resulting in a decrease in the amount of euro based receivables being marked to market 
these conversions thereby reduce the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations in our consolidated statements of operations 
through september   we did not engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exchange risk 
commencing october  we began using foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a 
table of contents portion of the foreign currency risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the yen and the euro 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one year or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts used to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as these transactions have not been designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
these contracts contain net settlement features 
if we experience unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  we may be required to use material amounts of cash to settle the transactions which may adversely affect the operating results that we report with respect to the corresponding period 
during the year ended december   we recorded exchange rate gains of  related to our foreign exchange forward contracts 
we currently hold foreign exchange forward contracts with a single counterparty 
the bank counterparty in these contracts exposes us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum credit quality guidelines 
in addition  our exposure in the event of a default by our counterparty is limited to the changes in value of our hedged balances 
at december   we were in a net receivable position with our counterparty for
