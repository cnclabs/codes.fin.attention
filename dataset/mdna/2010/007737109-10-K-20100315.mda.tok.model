item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company owns regional aircraft and engines  which are leased to customers under triple net operating leases 
the acquisition of such equipment is generally made using debt financing 
the company s profitability and cash flow are dependent in large part upon its ability to acquire equipment  obtain and maintain favorable lease rates on such equipment  and re lease or sell owned equipment that comes off lease 
the company is subject to the credit risk of its lessees  both as to collection of rental payments under its operating leases and as to performance by lessees of their obligations to maintain the equipment 
since lease rates for assets in the company s portfolio generally decline as the assets age  the company s ability to maint ain revenue and earnings is primarily dependent upon the company s ability to acquire and lease additional aircraft 
the company s principal cash expenditures are for management fees  maintenance expense  financing interest payments  professional fees  insurance and principal payments of the subordinated notes pursuant to an amortization schedule 
maintenance expenditures are incurred when aircraft or equipment are off lease  are being prepared for re lease  or require maintenance in excess of lease return conditions  as well as when maintenance work is performed in connection with the release of maintenance reserves previously received by the company from lessees 
see c 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs  below  regarding the company s accounting treatment of maintenance expenses 
the most significant non cash expenses include aircraft and engine depreciation and impairment provisions  which are affected by significant estimates  and  beginning in the second quarter of  amortization of costs associated with the company s subordinated notes  which is included in interest expense 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the most critical accounting policies include the following aircraft capitalization and depreciation  impairment of long lived assets  maintenance reserves and accrued costs  accounting for income taxes  and revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
a aircraft capitalization and depreciation the company s interests in aircraft and aircraft engines are recorded at cost  which includes acquisition costs 
since inception  the company has purchased only used aircraft and aircraft engines 
it is the company s policy to hold aircraft for approximately twelve years unless market conditions dictate otherwise 
therefore  depreciation on aircraft is initially computed using the straight line method over the twelve year period to an estimated residual value based on appraisal 
the company estimates the period over which it will hold aircraft engines based upon estimated usage  repair costs and other factors  and depreciates them to their appraised residual value over such period using the straight line method 
the company periodically reviews plans for lease or sale of its aircraft and aircraft engines and changes  as appropriate  the remaining expected holding period for such assets 
estimated residual values are reviewed and adjusted periodically  based upon updated appraised residual estimates 
decreases in the market value of aircraft could affect not only the current value  discussed above  but also the estimated residual value 
b impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews its portfolio of assets for impairment 
such review includes estimating current market values  re lease rents and residual values 
the estimates are based on currently available market data and third party appraisals and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
the company initiates its review annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset e xceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected undiscounted cash flows and if different conditions prevail  material write downs may occur 
no impairment provision was recorded in  however  in  the company recorded an impairment provision of  for one of its off lease aircraft based on the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the aircraft 
c maintenance reserves and accrued costs maintenance costs under the company s triple net operating leases are typically the responsibility of the lessees  and the majority of the company s leases require the payment of monthly maintenance reserves 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include i refundable maintenance payments billed to lessees  which are paid out as related maintenance is performed or at the end of the lease  ii for lessees who pay non refundable maintenance reserves  estimated maintenance costs accrued at the time a reimbursement claim or sufficient information is received regarding maintenance work performed  and iii maintenance for work performed for off lease aircraft  which is not related to the release of reserves received from lessees 
non refundable maintenance reserves are reflected as income based on reported usage  if collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses the direct expense method  under which maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
maintenance reserves are set by mutual agreement of the company and its lessee at inception of the lease and are based on the company s estimate of the total maintenance cost at some future point resulting from the lessee s usage 
reserve rates are typically subject to an annual adjustment provision that accounts for inflation of maintenance costs 
if a lessee is required to repair a component during the lease or perform a repair at lease end in order to comply with aircraft return conditions  it will be entitled to collect the reserves related to that repair from the company  and any excess costs would then be the responsibility of the lessee 
therefore  if maintenance rates do not accurately reflect the true cost of a repair  the company will not incur any financial impact 
if  however  the company repossesses an aircraft upon a lessee default  the company would incur expense for the entire cost of the maintenance 
if maintenance rates under the defaulted lease inaccurately reflect the costs of the lessee s usage  such costs would be in excess of collected reserves 
it is also possible that  in the case of a repossessed aircraft  in order to remarket the aircraft  certain inspections and repairs would need to be performed earlier than otherwise required by the manufacturer or regulatory specifications and anticipated by the company 
in such a case  the collected reserves from the defaulted lessee  which were established assuming a normal interval between repairs  would likely be insufficient to cover the total cost incurred by the company 
such was the case with one aircraft in and one aircraft in d accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management must also assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or changes the allowance in a period  the company reflects the corresponding increase or decrease in the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company measures and discloses the amount of its unrecognized tax positions 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s future taxable income for purposes of assessing the company s ability to realize any benefit from its deferred taxes 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
e revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from leasing of aircraft assets is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
deferred rent is recorded when the cash rent received is lower than the straight line revenue recognized 
such receivables decrease over the term of the applicable leases 
non refundable maintenance reserves billed to lessees are accrued as maintenance reserves income based on aircraft usage 
in instances for which collectibility is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenue as cash payments are received 
the company estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer  the level of past due accounts  and its analysis of the lessee s overall financial cond ition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  it could result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in  the company recorded bad debt expense of  and reduced maintenance reserves revenue by  to reserve against amounts due from two lessees with which the company had previously agreed to defer a portion of rent and reserves payments due during the company also recorded bad debt expense of  in in connection with the return of an aircraft 
in  the company recorded bad debt expense of  in connection with the return of an aircraft 
results of operations as discussed below  the company s net income increased by  from to  due primarily to increased operating lease revenues  decreased interest expense and a reduction in provision for impairment of aircraft  the aggregate effect of which was partially offset by decreased maintenance reserves income and increased maintenance expense and depreciation  an increase in bad debt expense  and a larger income tax provision 
a revenues operating lease revenue increased by  from to  as a result of the purchase of additional leased assets during and  as well as increased lease rates on some aircraft re leased during the period  the effects of which were partially offset by the lack of revenue from some assets that were off lease for all or part of revenue from maintenance reserves decreased by  primarily because of i a decrease of  as a result of lower average usage by lessees  ii two aircraft that were off lease for a longer period in than in  and iii a reduction in maintenance reserves revenue of  related to a revenue reserve due to collectibility of the related receivable 
the  increase in other income from to was a result of the receipt of interest on settlement of a federal tax audit  compensation from an unconsummated lease transaction and a gain on expected insurance proceeds related to a damaged spare engine in  as compared to income only from an unconsummated lease transaction in b expenses interest expense decreased by  from to  primarily as a result of lower average interest rates and balances related to the credit facility 
in addition  in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap the swap that expired on december   of day libor for a fixed rate payment on a nominal principal amount of million 
the company recognized a gain of  on the fair value of the swap in which decreased interest expense versus a loss of  in these effects were partially offset by an increase in net settlement interest related to the swap and an increase in subordinated notes interest and fee amortization as a result of the issuance of additional subordinated notes in july the company recognized  more in maintenance expense in than in the increase was due to the net effect of an increase in expense for off lease aircraft and a decrease in maintenance performed by lessees using non refundable reserves 
during and   and  respectively  of the company s maintenance expense was funded by non refundable maintenance reserves that had been recorded as income when accrued 
depreciation increased by  in as compared to  primarily because of purchases of aircraft and aircraft engines during july and august  as well as changes in residual values for several of the company s aircraft  which resulted in an overall decline in residual value 
the company also recognized a provision for asset impairment of  in no such impairment was recognized in management fees  which are calculated on the net book value of the aircraft  increased by only  from to because the increase in additional fees related to acquisitions during and was mostly offset by the effect of depreciation 
professional fees and general and administrative expenses decreased by  in  compared to  primarily because of a decrease in audit related accounting fees 
income tax expense increased  from to as a result of higher pre tax income 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
the change in rate was primarily the result of the recognition in of the effect of a difference for gaap and tax purposes in the valuation of warrants issued in connection with the company s issuance of the subordinated notes which increased the effective tax rate for 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its assets primarily through debt borrowings and excess cash flows 
a credit facility the company s credit facility  which is collateralized by all of the assets of aerocentury corp  expires on march  the aggregate amount of borrowings permitted under the credit facility is million 
during  the company borrowed  and repaid  of the outstanding principal 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility agreement   in principal amount was outstanding  interest of  was accrued  and there was  in borrowing capacity remaining 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility agreement   in principal amount was outstanding  interest of  was accrued  and there was  in borrowing capacity remai ning 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company pays a commitment fee based upon the applicable commitment fee rate on the unused portion of the credit facility 
commitment fees are expensed as incurred and paid quarterly in arrears 
the weighted average interest rate at december  and was and  respectively 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility 
based on its current projections  the company believes it will continue to be in compliance with all covenants of its credit facility  but there can be no assurance of such compliance in the future 
although the current credit facility expires on march   in march  the company received commitments totaling million from a new agent bank  as well as other participants  for a new two year credit facility  which has a maximum of million 
the commitment of one bank  for million  is conditioned upon the company and the other participants reaching agreement regarding some proposed changes to the provisions proposed by the agent bank 
the company is negotiating the revised provisions 
the company anticipates that it will complete the agreements for the new credit facility no later than march   when the current credit facility expires 
the company s interest expense in connection with the credit facility generally increases and decreases with prevailing interest rates  although the company did enter into the swap in december that expired in december  as discussed in note to the company s financial statements and paragraph b below 
because aircraft owners seeking financing generally can obtain financing through either leasing transactions or traditional secured debt financings  prevailing interest rates are a significant factor in determining market lease rates  and market lease rates generally move up or down with prevailing interest rates  assuming supply and demand of the desired equipment remain constant 
however  because lease rates for the company s assets typically are fixed under existing leases  the company normally does not experience any positive or negative impact in revenue from changes in market lease rates due to interest rate changes until existing leases have terminated and new lease rates are set as aircraft are re leased 
b derivative instrument in december  the company entered into a two year interest rate swap the swap with a notional amount of million  under which it committed to make or receive a net settlement for the difference in interest receivable computed monthly on the basis of day libor and interest payable monthly on the basis of a fixed rate of per annum 
the company entered into the swap with the objective of economically converting a portion of its floating rate debt into a fixed rate for the term of the swap  thereby reducing the volatility of cash flow associated with its debt obligations 
the swap expired at december   and therefore is not included in the balance sheet on that date 
at december   the company recorded the negative  fair value of the swap as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet as a component of notes payable and accrued interest 
the company recorded a gain on the swap of  in which decreased reported interest expense and a loss on the swap of  in which increased reported interest expense 
the company also recognized additional interest expense on the net settlement the net amount paid to the counterparty for the fixed versus the floating rate components of the swap of  and  in and  respectively 
for gaap purposes  fair value measurements can be made using several valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow  and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
gaap utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the swap agreement effectively converted million of the company s short term variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under this agreement  the company paid a fixed rate and received a variable rate of libor 
the fair value of this interest rate derivative was based on quoted prices for similar instruments from a commercial bank and  therefore  the interest rate derivative is considered a level input 
c senior unsecured subordinated debt in april  the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the subordinated notes agreement  whereby the company would issue senior unsecured subordinated notes subordinated notes  with an aggregate principal amount of million to certain note purchasers 
the subordinated notes were to be issued at of the face amount and are due december  principal payments which fully amortize the balance of the subordinated notes were due beginning april  through december  in amounts necessary to cause i the balance of the subordinated notes and ii the ratio of total outstanding debt under the credit facility and subordinated notes compared to the discounted portfolio value to not exceed amounts specified in the subordinated notes agreement 
the holders of subordinated notes also were issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a four year period after the earliest of i a change of control  or ii the final maturity of the related subordinated notes  which is december  pursuant to an investors rights agreement  the warrants are subject to registration rights that require the company to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants on a registration statement filed with the sec 
in july  the company and the holders of subordinated notes agreed to amend the subordinated notes agreement to reduce the maximum amount of subordinated notes to be issued from million to million and to reduce the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued from  to  the estimated fair value of the warrants cancelled was  and was recorded as a reduction to paid in capital and debt discount 
the amendment also provided for the refund to the company of certain fees paid at the initial closing of the subordinated notes agreement  as well as a portion of the unused commitment fees paid through june   and revised certain prepayment provisions of the subordinated notes agreement 
the amendment was accounted for a s a debt modification 
the net proceeds from the  of subordinated notes that were issued pursuant to the amendment were used to repay a portion of the company s credit facility debt 
as of december   the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was approximately  outstanding principal amount of  less unamortized debt discount of approximately  and accrued interest payable was as of december   the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was approximately  outstanding principal amount of  less unamortized debt discount of approximately  and accrued interest payable was the company was in compliance with all covenants under the subordinated notes agreement as of december  and d special purpose financing at december   aerocentury vi llc owned a dash aircraft  which was financed using a non recourse note from a bank separate from the company s credit facility 
the principal amount owed under the note at december  was  and interest of was accrued 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants of this note obligation 
in march  the company repaid the outstanding principal of  owed by the subsidiary under its special purpose financing and paid a prepayment penalty of  at the same time  the company transferred ownership of the aircraft that served as collateral for the financing from aerocentury vi llc to aerocentury corp  whereupon the aircraft became eligible as collateral under the credit facility 
aerocen tury vi llc was dissolved in september e cash flow the company s primary sources of cash are aircraft lease rentals and maintenance reserves billed monthly to lessees based on aircraft usage 
maintenance reserves collected by the company are not required by the leases to be segregated and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is currently not receiving lease revenue for its off lease assets  comprised of four fokker and two saab a aircraft and one general electric cf e engine 
the company has incurred significant maintenance expense in order to prepare the saab a aircraft for re lease 
six of the company s leases expire during the first half of in addition  in january  the company received notice from a lessee that one of the company s dash aircraft had sustained significant damage 
the insurer deemed the aircraft a total loss  and the company is awaiting insurance proceeds  which will be used to acquire a replacement aircraft 
the company expects that the insurance proceeds will be in excess of the net bo ok value of the aircraft 
the company s primary uses of cash are for servicing principal and interest payments due under the company s debt obligations  maintenance expense  management fees  professional fees  and insurance 
debt repayment obligations increased in april  when the subordinated notes debt repayment schedule began to require principal amortization in addition to interest 
the amount of interest paid by the company is dependent on the outstanding balances of its credit facility and subordinated notes debt 
although the subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate  the amount of interest owed under the credit facility is dependent on changes in prevailing interest rates  since the credit facility debt carries a floating interest rate 
the amount and timing of the company s maintenance payments are dependent on the aggregate amount of the maintenance claims submitted by lessees for reimbursement from reserves and expenses incurred in connection with preparation of off lease aircraft for re lease to new customers 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its ongoing operational needs  including required repayments under its credit facility  new credit facility and subordinated notes  based upon its estimates of future revenues and expenditures  which include assumptions regarding i replacement of the credit facility when it expires in march  ii rents on assets to be re leased  iii timely use of proceeds of unused debt capacity toward additional acquisitions of income producing assets  iv required debt payments  v interest rate increases and decreases  and vi the cost and anticipated timing of maintenance to be performed 
although the company believes that the assumptions it has made in forecasting its cash flow are reasonable in light of experience  actual results could deviate from such assumptions 
among the more significant factors outside the company s control that could have an impact on the accuracy of cash flow assumptions are i an increase in interest rates that negatively affects the company s profitability and causes the company to violate covenants of its credit facility  new credit facility or its subordinated notes agreement  which may in turn require repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility  new credit facility or the subordinated notes  ii lessee non performance or non compliance with lease obligations which may affect credit facility collateral limitations and subordinated notes covenants  as well as revenue and expenses  iii inability to locate and acquire a sufficient volume of additional aircraft assets at prices that will produce acceptable net returns  iv lessee performance of maintenance earlier than anticipated  v inability to locate new lessees for returned equipment within a reasonable remarketing period  or at a rent level consistent with projected rental rates for the asset  vi failure to renew the credit facility on terms favorable to the company or at all  and vii if the credit facility is renewed  a reduction in participation by lender participants that reduces the company s ability to borrow 
i operating activities the company s cash flow from operations increased from to by  as discussed below  the change in cash flow was primarily a result of an increase in payments received for rent  security deposits and tax refunds and a decrease in expenditures for interest  the effects of which were partially offset by an increase in expenditures for maintenance and a decrease in payments received for maintenance reserves 
lease rents  maintenance reserves and security deposits payments received from lessees for rent increased from to by  in  primarily due to rent payments for aircraft and aircraft engines acquired during and  and re leases during at increased rental rates for several of the company s aircraft 
the aggregate effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to two aircraft that were off lease for all or part of  as well as the effect of rent that was deferred for several aircraft 
payments received for refundable and non refundable maintenance reserves are based on usage of the company s aircraft 
such payments were  lower in than in  primarily as a result of lower average usage of aircraft by some of the company s lessees 
the company received security deposits in the amount of  during during  the company returned a  security deposit to a lessee upon return of an aircraft at lease end and received security deposits totaling  in connection with the re lease of one of the company s aircraft 
payments for interest payments for interest decreased by  in  compared to the company paid  less interest related to the company s credit facility and special purpose financing debt in the period compared to the same period in as a result of lower average outstanding balances and lower average index rates upon which the credit facility and special purpose financing interest rates were based 
however  the company paid  more in commitment fees related to the unused portion of its credit facility in the period 
the company paid  less in commitment fees related to its subordinated notes debt in the period because no such fees were payable after the company s issuance of the remaining available subordinated notes in july the aggregate effect of these decreases was partially offset by an increase of  in interest payments related to the company s subordinated notes in  compared to  as a result of a higher average principal balance 
during  the company also paid  more of net settlement interest related to the swap than during the period 
payments for maintenance payments for maintenance increased by  in  compared to the period  as a result of payments related to off lease aircraft  which were  greater in  offset partially by  of lower payments for lessee maintenance claims in the amount of payments for maintenance in future periods will be dependent on the amount and timing of maintenance paid as reimbursement to lessees from maintenance reserves  which are dependent upon utilization and required maintenance intervals  and maintenance paid for off lease aircraft 
income taxes federal and state income tax receipts net of payments were  higher in than in in  the company made payments of  for federal and state taxes and received a tax refund of  as a result of amending its tax return 
in  the company made payments of  for federal and state taxes and received a tax refund of  as a result of amending its and federal tax returns 
ii investing activities during and  the company used cash of  and  respectively  for aircraft and aircraft engine purchases and capital equipment installed on aircraft 
iii financing activities the company borrowed  and  during and  respectively 
the company repaid  and  of its outstanding debt in and  respectively 
such payments were funded by excess cash flow 
in  the company also issued  of principal amount of subordinated notes  the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the company s credit facility debt 
outlook a general the current global downturn has resulted in a significant reduction in airline passenger volume and in reaction to that  a reduction in the number of aircraft needed for operation by large and small carriers in nearly all geographic areas 
this capacity reduction has created a challenging environment for the company in three respects the reduction in the demand for aircraft has increased the possibility that the company s current lessees will choose to return leased aircraft at lease expiration rather than renew the existing leases  notwithstanding that returning aircraft under the lease terms may be very expensive 
in  leases for of the company s aircraft expire  so extending current leases and remarketing aircraft that are returned will be a significant focus 
it is likely that the company will experience lower on lease utilization rates  as the company experiences longer lead times for remarketing of returned aircraft 
the downturn also creates fewer opportunities for acquisitions for the company 
the company s customers are generally carriers needing additional aircraft to expand their route system or frequency 
in the current environment of reduced demand for air travel and consequently reduced capacity by carriers  there is likely to be a significant decrease in the pool of such customers requiring leased aircraft 
therefore  it is likely that the company s portfolio growth will be slower in the near future than it has been in recent years  as fewer carriers seek to expand their fleets with leased aircraft 
finally  the global economic situation also increases the possibility of an unanticipated lessee default due to a business failure by a lessee  particularly the less established carriers among the company s customers 
this could result not only in the unscheduled return of an aircraft to the company for remarketing  but also an unanticipated expense related to defaults by the lessee in its maintenance and return condition obligations 
at december   the company recorded an allowance against a total of  due from two of these lessees 
the company has seen indications of a weakening in both the financial condition and operating results of the majority of its customers 
the company is monitoring the performance of all of its lessees 
as discussed below  the company has agreed to payment deferrals with several of its lessees 
in february  the company agreed to defer a portion of the rent and maintenance reserves due from the lessee of two of the company s fokker aircraft 
the agreement required payment in four  equal monthly installments beginning in march  the company has received all four payments 
in march  the company agreed to defer  of the rent and maintenance reserves due in january and february from the same lessee 
the deferred amounts are to be paid in monthly installments from june through december in june  the company and the lessee for three of the company s fokker aircraft entered into an agreement which deferred payment of three months of rent for each aircraft  totaling  and allowed for the application of a portion of the security deposits held by the company to maintenance reserves owed to the company 
the deferred rent is to be paid in monthly installments beginning january and continuing through the expiration date of each lease 
the company has received the deferral payments due in january and february  after which the deferral balance  including accrued interest  was approximately  in march  the company agreed to apply a portion of the lessee s security deposits to rent that was due in january and to defer an additional  of rent due in february  to be paid in two monthly installments in march and april the deferral agreement requires that the lessee restore the security deposits to their full amounts no later than may  in june  the company also agreed to defer payment of rent and reserves due from the lessee of two of the company s dhc and one dhc aircraft 
the agreement allows for the deferred amount of approximately  to be paid in monthly installments beginning in august the company has received all deferral payments due to date 
the company has received the deferral payments due through february  after which the deferral balance  including accrued interest  was approximately  in october  the company and a customer that leases two of its fokker aircraft agreed to defer payment of rent and reserves totaling approximately  to april in february  the company agreed to defer a portion of the rent and maintenance reserves due in february  march and april  with all deferred amounts to be paid in april b pending transactions  events and remarketing efforts in march  the company received commitments totaling million from a new agent bank  as well as other participants  for a new two year credit facility  which has a maximum of million 
the commitment of one bank  for million  is conditioned upon the company and the other participants reaching agreement regarding some proposed changes to the provisions proposed by the agent bank 
the company is negotiating the revised provisions 
the company anticipates that it will complete the agreements for the new credit facility no later than march   when the current credit facility expires 
on december   the company entered into a lease of a fokker aircraft that was returned by its previous lessee in august the aircraft was delivered in march during  the company extended the terms of six leases and re leased two aircraft that were returned in august and february the lease for another of the company s aircraft  which was due to expire in april  was extended for two years in early the company is seeking a lessee for the engine it purchased in december  and has a signed term sheet for the two off lease saab a aircraft 
in february  the lessee of three of the company s fokker aircraft returned two of the aircraft 
in addition  the lessee for two other fokker aircraft  with leases which were to expire on march   declared bankruptcy  and the company took possession of the aircraft 
the company is investigating its rights related to the cash security deposits and letter of credit held by the company 
if the aircraft that are currently off lease remain off lease for an extended period of time and the company is not successful in extending the leases for a majority of the leases expiring in  the company may not have sufficient cash flow to meet its operational needs or remain in compliance with the terms of its credit facility  new credit facility and subordinated notes 
factors that may affect future results availability of financing 
the current term of the company s million credit facility expires in march as of march   the balance due under the credit facility was million 
in march  the company received commitments totaling million from a new agent bank  as well as other participants  for a new two year credit facility  which has a maximum of million 
the commitment of one bank  for million  is conditioned upon the company and the other participants reaching agreement regarding some proposed changes to the provisions proposed by the agent bank 
the company is negotiating the revised provisions 
the company anticipates that it will complete the agreements for the new credit facility no later than march   when the current credit facility expires 
the company believes that the availability under the new credit facility will be sufficient to fund projected acquisitions through in the longer term  however  the company s continued growth will depend on its ability to obtain capital  either through debt or equity financings 
the financial markets have experienced significant setbacks that have made access to capital more costly and difficult 
as a result  commercial lending origination has dramatically decreased  and asset based debt financing is now more difficult to obtain 
the company will continue to seek additional lenders for participation in the new credit facility in order to increase the maximum availability and will continue to investigate other sources of debt financing 
there is no assurance that the company will succeed in finding such additional funding  and if such financing is found  it will likely be on terms less favorable than the company s current debt financings 
general economic conditions and lowered demand for travel 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the industry is in a period of financial difficulty and contraction due to the global economic downturn 
passenger volume has fallen significantly for carriers worldwide  and the loss of revenue has affected many carriers financial condition 
this loss of revenue  combined with the continuing lack of availability of additional debt financing relied on by many regional carriers caused by the ongoing credit crisis  increases the likelihood of failures 
events such as the spread of the hn flu epidemic or a terrorist attack against aviation could exace rbate an already weakened condition and lead to widespread failures in the air carrier industries 
if lessees experience financial difficulties and are unable to meet lease obligations  this will  in turn  negatively affect the company s financial performance 
during periods of economic contraction  carriers generally reduce capacity in response to lower passenger loads  and as a result  there is a reduced demand for aircraft and a corresponding decrease in market lease rental rates and aircraft values 
this reduced market value for aircraft could affect the company s results if the market value of an asset or assets in the company s aircraft portfolio falls below carrying value  and the company determines that a write down of the value on the company s balance sheet is appropriate 
furthermore  as older leases expire and are replaced by lease renewals or re leases at decreasing lease rates  the lease revenue from the company s existing portfolio is likely to decline  with the magnitude of the decline dependent on the length of the downturn and the depth of the decline in market rents 
economic downturns can affect specific regions of the world exclusively 
as the company s portfolio is not entirely globally diversified  a localized downturn in one of the key regions in which the company leases aircraft could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
several of the company s lessees that have experienced financial difficulties arising from a combination of the weakened air carrier market and their own unique financial circumstances have requested and been granted deferral of certain overdue and or future rental or reserve payment obligations 
current deferral arrangements are described in the section entitled outlook a general 
if the current weakened air carrier environment continues  it is possible that the company may enter into additional deferral agreements 
when a lessee requests a deferral of lease obligations  the company evaluates the financial plan of the lessee and the likelihood that the lessee can remain a viable carrier  and whether the deferral will be repaid according to the agreed s chedule 
if the company feels that there is a risk that deferred obligations will not be repaid  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the company makes a judgment that the lessee is likely to meet its deferred obligations  the company continues to record the deferred rental and reserve payments as income in the periods in which they accrue 
it is possible that a lessee that the company judges to be likely to repay its deferred obligations could experience worsening financial condition 
in that circumstance  the company may determine that full repayment of the deferred obligations is no longer likely  in which case the company would record a bad debt expense or reduction of income 
this could have a material effect on the company s financial results in the period that such bad debt expense or income reduction is recorded 
ownership risks 
the company s portfolio is leased under operating leases  with lease terms that are less than the entire anticipated remaining useful life of an asset 
the company s ability to recover its purchase investment in an asset subject to an operating lease is dependent upon the company s ability to profitably re lease or sell the asset after the expiration of the initial lease term 
some of the factors that have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell include worldwide economic conditions  general aircraft market conditions  regulatory changes that may make an asset s use more expensive or preclude use unless the asset is modified  changes in the supply or cost of aircraft equipment and technological developments which cause the asset to become obsolete 
if the company is unable to remarket its aircraft equipment on favorable terms when the operating leases for such equipment expire  the company s business  financial condition  cash flow  ability to service debt and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  a successful investment in an asset subject to an operating lease depends in part upon having the asset returned by the lessee in the condition as required under the lease 
typically  a lessee has the obligation to return an aircraft to the company in the condition required under a lease  which generally requires the aircraft be returned in equal or better condition than at delivery to the lessee 
if the lessee becomes insolvent during the term of its lease and the company has to repossess the aircraft from the lessee  it is unlikely that the lessee will have the financial ability to meet these return obligations 
thus  upon repossession  the company may be required to expend funds in excess of the maintenance reserves collected from the lessee to return the aircraft to a remarketable condi tion if the collected reserves are insufficient to fund the total expense of such repair and maintenance 
furthermore  an asset impairment charge against the company s earnings may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse changes that impact the company s estimates of expected cash flows generated from such asset 
the company periodically reviews long term assets for impairment  in particular  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the company may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a prolonged weak economic environment  challenging market conditions in the airline industry or events related to particular lessees  assets or asset types 
several of the company s leases do not require payment of monthly maintenance reserves  and if a repossession due to lessee default occurs  the company will not have received payment for the costs of unperformed repair and maintenance under the applicable lease 
credit facility obligations 
the company is obligated to make repayments of principal under the credit facility in order to maintain certain debt ratios with respect to its assets in the borrowing base 
assets that come off lease and remain off lease for a period of time  as well as assets with lease payments more than days past due may reduce the borrowing base 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash funds to make any payment that arises due to borrowing base limitations caused by assets scheduled to come off lease in the near term 
the company s belief is based on certain assumptions regarding renewal of existing leases  interest rates  profitability  lessee defaults or bankruptcies  and certain other matters that the c ompany deems reasonable in light of its experience in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove to be correct 
if the assumptions are incorrect for example  if an asset in the collateral base unexpectedly is off lease for an extended period of time and the company has not obtained an applicable waiver or amendment of applicable covenants from its lenders to mitigate the situation  the company may have to sell a significant portion of its portfolio in order to avoid a default under the credit facility agreement 
risks of debt financing 
the company s use of debt as the primary form of acquisition financing subjects the company to increased risks of leveraging 
indebtedness owed under the credit facility and the subordinated notes carries a higher cost of capital relative to equity financing  resulting in relatively higher expense and reduced free cash flow 
debt financing is secured by the company s assets 
in addition to payment obligations  the credit facility and subordinated notes also require the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including a requirement of positive earnings and compliance with interest coverage ratios and required net worth 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could res ult in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company securing the loan 
any such default could also result in a cross default under the subordinated notes 
lessee credit risk 
if a customer defaults upon its lease obligations  the company may be limited in its ability to enforce remedies 
most of the company s lessees are small  regional passenger airlines  which may be even more sensitive to airline industry market conditions than the major airlines 
as a result  the company s inability to collect payments under a lease or to repossess equipment in the event of a lessee default could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue 
most of the company s lessees are foreign and not subject to us bankruptcy laws  although there may be debtor protection similar to us bankruptcy laws available in some jurisdictions 
if a lessee that is a certifie d us airline is in default under a lease and seeks protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  section of the bankruptcy code would automatically prevent the company from exercising any remedies for a period of days 
after the day period has passed  the lessee must agree to perform the lease obligations and cure any defaults  or the company will have the right to repossess the equipment 
this procedure under the bankruptcy code has been subject to significant litigation  however  and it is possible that the company s enforcement rights may be further adversely affected by a declaration of bankruptcy by a defaulting lessee 
investment in new aircraft types 
the company has traditionally invested in a limited number of types of turboprop aircraft and engines 
while the company intends to continue to focus solely on regional aircraft and engines  beginning in  the company has acquired several fokker regional jet aircraft  and may continue to seek acquisition opportunities for new types and models of regional jet and turboprop aircraft and engines used in the company s targeted customer base of regional air carriers 
acquisition of other aircraft types and engines not previously acquired by the company entails greater ownership risk due to the company s lack of experience managing those aircraft and engine types 
the company believes  however  that the overall industry ex perience of jmc s personnel and its technical resources should permit the company to effectively manage such new aircraft types and engines 
further  the broadening of the asset types in the aircraft portfolio may have a benefit of diversifying the company s portfolio see factors that may affect future results concentration of lessees and aircraft type  below 
warrant issuance 
as part of the subordinated notes financing  as revised upon the second and final closing in july  the holders of subordinated notes hold warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  which represents of the post exercise fully diluted capitalization of the company as of the initial closing of the subordinated notes financing 
the exercise price under the warrants is per share 
if the warrants to purchase shares are exercised at a time when the exercise price is less than the fair market value of the company s common stock  there would be dilution to the existing holders of common stock 
this dilution of the company s common stock could depress its trading price 
concentration of lessees and aircraft type 
for the month ended february   the company s two largest customers were located in mexico and antigua and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s monthly lease revenue 
a lease default by or collection problem with one or a combination of any of these significant customers could have a disproportionate negative impact on the company s financial results  and  therefore  the company s operating results are especially sensitive to any negative developments with respect to these customers in terms of lease compliance or collection 
such concentrat ion of lessee credit risk decreases as the company leases additional assets to new lessees 
as of february   the company owned fourteen fokker  eight dhc and seven fokker aircraft  making these three aircraft types the dominant types in the portfolio and representing  and  respectively  of net book value  respectively 
as a result  a change in the desirability and availability of any of these types of aircraft  which would in turn affect valuations of such aircraft  would have a disproportionately significant impact on the company s portfolio value 
such aircraft type concentration will diminish if the company acquires additional assets of other types 
conversely  acquisition of these types of aircraft will increase the company s risks related to its concentration of those aircraft types 
leasing risks 
the company s successful negotiation of lease extensions  re leases and sales is critical to its ability to achieve its financial objectives  and involves a number of risks 
demand for lease or purchase of the assets depends on the economic condition of the airline industry  which is  in turn  sensitive to general economic conditions 
the ability to re lease equipment at acceptable rates may depend on the demand and market values at the time of remarketing 
the company acquires used aircraft equipment 
the market for used aircraft equipment has been cyclical  and generally reflects economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the demand for and value of many t ypes of used aircraft in the recent past has been depressed by such factors as airline financial difficulties  increased fuel costs  the number of new aircraft on order and the number of aircraft coming off lease 
values may also increase for certain aircraft types that become desirable based on market conditions and changing airline capacity 
if the company were to purchase an aircraft during a period of increasing values  it would in turn need to lease such aircraft at a corresponding higher lease rate to compensate for its higher purchase price 
risks related to regional air carriers 
because the company s customer base is regional air carriers and the company continues to focus on this market  it is subject to additional risks 
some of the lessees in the regional air carrier market are companies that are start up  low capital  and or low margin operators 
often  the success of such carriers is dependent upon contractual arrangements with major trunk carriers or franchises from governmental agencies that provide subsidies for operating essential air routes  both of which may be subject to termination or cancellation with short notice periods 
because of this exposure  the company typically is able to obtain generally higher lease rates from these types of lessees 
 in the event of a business failure or bankruptcy of the lessee  the company can generally regain possession of its aircraft  but the aircraft could be in substantially worse condition than would be the case if the aircraft were returned in accordance with the lease provisions at lease expiration 
the company evaluates the credit risk of each lessee carefully  and attempts to obtain a third party guaranty  letters of credit or other credit enhancements  if it deems them necessary in addition to customary security deposits 
there is no assurance  however  that such enhancements will be available or that  if obtained  they will fully protect the company from losses resulting from a lessee default or bankruptcy 
also  most of the company s current and expected growth is outside of the united states  where collection and enforcement are often more difficult and complicated than in the united states 
the company has seen indications of a weakening in both the financial condition and operating results of the majority of its customers 
the company is closely monitoring the performance of all of its lessees 
if any of the company s current or future lessees are unable to meet their lease obligations  the company s future results could be materially and adversely impacted 
interest rate risk 
the credit facility and the proposed new credit facility carry a floating interest rate based upon short term interest rate indices 
lease rates typically  but not always  move over time with interest rates  but market demand and numerous other factors for the asset also affect lease rates 
because the company s typical lease rates are fixed at the origination of leases  interest rate changes during the term of a lease have no effect on existing lease payments 
therefore  if interest rates rise significantly  and there is relatively little lease origination by the company following such rate increases  the company could experience lower net income 
further  even if significant lease origination occurs following such rate increases  other contemporaneous aircraft market forces may result in lower or flat rental rates  and the company could also experience lower net income 
international risks 
the company has focused on leases in overseas markets 
leases with foreign lessees  however  may present different risks than those with domestic lessees 
foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may be more or less protective of lessor rights than those which apply in the united states 
the company could experience collection or repossession problems related to the enforcement of its lease agreements under foreign local laws and remedies in foreign jurisdictions 
the protections potentially offered by section of the bankruptcy code do not apply to non us carriers  and applicable local law may not offer similar protections 
certain countries do not have a central registration or recording system with which to locally establish the company s interest in equipment and related leases 
this could make it more difficult for the company to recover an aircraft in the event of a default by a foreign lessee 
a lease with a foreign lessee is subject to risks related to the economy of the country or region in which such lessee is located  which may be weaker than the us economy 
a foreign economic downturn may impact a foreign lessee s ability to make lease payments  even though the us and other economies remain stable 
in addition  foreign lessees are subject to risks related to currency conversion fluctuations 
although the company s current leases are all payable in us dollars  the company may agree in the future to leases that permit payment in foreign currency  which would subject such lease revenue to monetary risk due to currency fluctuations 
in addition  if the company undertakes certain obligations under a lease to contribute to a repair or improvement and if the work is performed in a foreign jurisdiction and paid for in foreign currency  currency fluctuations causing a weaker dollar between the time such agreement is made and the time payment for the work is made may result in an unanticipated increase in us dollar denominated cost for the company 
even with us dollar denominated lease payment provisions  the company could still be affected by a devaluation of the lessee s local currency that would make it more difficult for a lessee to meet its us dollar denominated payments  increasing the risk of default of that lessee  particularly if its revenue is primarily derived in the local currency 
finally  ownership of a leased asset operating in a foreign country and or by a foreign carrier may subject the company to additional tax liabilities that are not present with domestically operated aircraft 
depending on the jurisdiction  laws governing such tax liabilities may be complex  not well formed or not uniformly enforced 
in such jurisdictions  the company may decide to take an uncertain tax position based on the best advice of the local tax experts it engages  which position may be challenged by the taxing authority 
if the taxing authority later assesses a liability  the company may be required to pay penalties and interest on the assessed amount  which penalties and interest would not give rise to a corresponding foreign tax credit on the company s u 
s 
tax return 
reliance on jmc 
all management of the company is performed by jmc under a management agreement between the company and jmc  which is in the thirteenth year of a year term and provides for an asset based management fee 
jmc is not a fiduciary to the company or its stockholders 
the company s board of directors the board has ultimate control and supervisory responsibility over all aspects of the company and owes fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
the board has no control over the internal operations of jmc  but the board does have the ability and responsibility to manage the company s relationship with jmc and the performance of jmc s obligations to the company under the management agreement  as it would have for any third par ty service provider to the company 
while jmc may not owe any fiduciary duties to the company by virtue of the management agreement  all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and in that capacity owe fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
in addition  certain officers of the company hold significant ownership positions in the company and jhc  the parent company of jmc 
the management agreement may be terminated if jmc defaults on its obligations to the company 
however  the agreement provides for liquidated damages in the event of its wrongful termination by the company 
all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and certain directors of the company are also directors of jmc 
consequently  the directors and officers of jmc may have a conflict of interest in the event of a dispute between the company and jmc 
although the company has taken steps to prevent conflicts of interest arising from such dual roles  such conflicts may still occur 
jmc has acted as the management company for two other aircraft portfolio owners  jetfleet iii  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds  and aerocentury iv  inc aerocentury iv  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds 
in the first quarter of  aerocentury iv defaulted on certain bond obligations 
in june  the indenture trustee for aerocentury iv s bondholders repossessed aerocentury iv s assets and took over management of aerocentury iv s remaining assets 
jetfleet iii defaulted on its bond obligation of  in may the indenture trustee for jetfleet iii bondholders repossessed jetfleet iii s unsold assets in late may management fee structure 
all decisions regarding acquisitions and disposal of aircraft from the company s portfolio are made by jmc 
jmc is paid a management fee based on the net asset value of the company s portfolio 
it also receives a one time asset acquisition fee upon purchase of an aircraft by the company  and a one time sale fee upon disposal of an aircraft 
optimization of the results of the company depends on timing of the acquisition  lease yield on the acquired assets  and re lease or sale of its portfolio assets 
under the current management fee structure  a larger volume of acquisitions generates acquisition fees and also increases the periodic management fee by increasing the size of the aircraft portfolio 
since the compan y s current business strategy involves continued growth of its portfolio and a buy and hold strategy  a compensation structure that results in greater compensation with an increased portfolio size is not inherently inconsistent with that strategy 
the compensation structure does  nonetheless  create a situation where a decision by jmc for the company to forego an asset transaction deemed to be an unacceptable business risk due to the lessee or the aircraft type is in conflict with jmc s own pecuniary interest 
as a result  the compensation structure could act to incent greater risk taking by jmc in asset acquisition decision making 
all acquisition decisions by jmc on behalf of the company  however  currently require credit facility lender approval of the asset acquired and the lessee in order to be included in the credit facility borrowing base  and the company has established objective target guidelines for yields on acquired assets 
further  any acquisition that involves a new asset type must be approved by the board of the company  including the outside independent directors 
while the company currently believes the foregoing are effective mitigating factors against undue compensation incented risk taking by jmc  there is no assurance that such mechanisms can entirely and effectively eliminate such risk 
government regulation 
there are a number of areas in which government regulation may result in costs to the company 
these include aircraft registration  safety requirements  required equipment modifications  and aircraft noise requirements 
although it is contemplated that the burden and cost of complying with such requirements will fall primarily upon lessees of equipment  there can be no assurance that the cost will not fall on the company 
furthermore  future government regulations could cause the value of any non complying equipment owned by the company to decline substantially 
competition 
the aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with aircraft manufacturers  distributors  airlines and other operators  equipment managers  leasing companies  equipment leasing programs  financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing  managing or remarketing aircraft  many of which have significantly greater financial resources 
however  the company believes that it is competitive because of jmc s experience and operational efficiency in identifying and obtaining financing for the transaction types desired by regional air carriers 
this market segment  which is characterized by transaction sizes of less than million and in many cases privately held lessees  without well esta blished third party credit ratings  is not well served by the company s larger competitors 
jmc has developed a reputation as a global participant in this segment of the market  and the company believes that jmc s reputation benefits the company 
there is  however  no assurance that competition from larger aircraft leasing companies will not increase significantly or that jmc s reputation will continue to be strong in this market segment 
casualties  insurance coverage 
the company  as owner of transportation equipment  may be named in a suit claiming damages for injuries or damage to property caused by its assets 
as a triple net lessor  the company is generally protected against such claims  since the lessee would be responsible for  and insure against and indemnify the company for such claims 
although some protection may be provided by the united states aviation act with respect to the company s aircraft assets  it is unclear to what extent such statutory protection would be available to the company with respect to most of the company s aircraft  which are operated in foreign countries  where such provisions of the united states aviation act may not apply 
 also  although the company s leases generally require a lessee to insure against likely risks  there may be certain cases where the loss is not entirely covered by the lessee or its insurance 
though this is a remote possibility  an uninsured loss with respect to the equipment  or an insured loss for which insurance proceeds are inadequate  would result in a possible loss of invested capital in and any profits anticipated from  such equipment  as well as a potential claim directly against the company 
compliance with future environmental regulations 
compliance with future environmental regulations may harm the company s business 
many aspects of aircraft operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations  and growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition by the u 
s and foreign governments of additional regulation of carbon emissions  aimed at either requiring adoption of technology to reduce the amount of carbon emissions or putting in place a fee or tax system on carbon emitters 
it is likely that any such regulation will be directed at the company s customers  as operators of aircraft  or at the company  as owners of aircraft 
 while under the company s triple net arrangements  the company would likely shift responsibility for compliance to its lessees  there may be some costs of regulation that are not able to be shifted to a current lessee  and would have to be borne by the company 
although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental regulations adopted in the future will not have such an effect 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to fluctuations following developments relating to the company s operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the airline industry  changes in accounting principles or tax laws applicable to the company or its lessees  or other developments affecting the company  its customers or its competitors  or arising from other investor sentiment unknown to the company 
because the company has a relatively small capitalization of approximately million shares outstanding  there is a correspondingly limited amount of trading and float of the company s shares 
consequently  the company s stock price is more sensitive to a single large trade or a small number of simultaneous trades along the same trend than a company with larger capitalization and higher trading volume and float
