executive summary general tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages losses from continuing operations were million cents per diluted share in compared with income from continuing operations of million cents per diluted share in gains on the sale of assets  investment write downs or write ups and other items and losses related to plant shutdowns  assets impairments  restructurings and other charges are described in results of operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page film products in film products  net sales were million in  down versus million in operating profit from ongoing operations was million in  an increase of compared with million in volume decreased to million pounds in from million pounds in net sales declined compared to last year due to the impact on selling prices from the pass through of lower resin costs  volume declines in personal care materials and packaging films and the unfavorable effect of changes in the us dollar value of currencies for operations outside the us operating profit from ongoing operations increased in compared to as cost reduction efforts  productivity gains  the positive impact of the change in product mix driven mostly by an increase in sales of high value surface protection materials and the lag in the pass through of reduced resin costs were partially offset by lower overall sales volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rates 
film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
the estimated impact of the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs and year end adjustments for inventories accounted for under the last in first out method lifo was a positive million in and a negative  in the estimated unfavorable impact from us dollar value currencies for operations outside the us was million in compared with future operating profit levels within film products will depend upon our ability to deliver product innovations and cost reductions  to support growth in the sales of higher value surface protection materials and to address competitive pressures facing our personal care and packaging materials businesses 
capital expenditures in film products were million in  up from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in as spending returns to more normalized levels 
depreciation expense was million in  down from million in  and is projected to be approximately million in aluminum extrusions net sales from continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in operating losses from ongoing us operations were million  a negative change of million from operating profits of million in volume from continuing operations was million pounds in  down from million pounds in the decrease in net sales was mainly due to lower sales volume and a decrease in average selling prices driven by lower average aluminum costs 
weak market conditions led to decreased shipments in most markets 
shipments in nonresidential construction  which comprised of total volume in  declined by approximately in compared with operating losses from ongoing us operations in were primarily driven by lower sales volume 
given the uncertainty as to the timing of a meaningful recovery in the nonresidential construction market  our short term focus in aluminum extrusions continues to be reducing our breakeven point while strategically investing in the business to ensure continued improvement in product and service offer ings to our customers 
upon completing a goodwill impairment analysis as of march   a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax was recognized in aluminum extrusions 
this impairment charge represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with the aluminum extrusions reporting unit 
for additional detail on this goodwill impairment charge  see note of the notes to the financial statements beginning on page capital expenditures for continuing operations in aluminum extrusions were million in  a million increase from million in  and are projected to be approximately million in the month project to expand capacity at our carthage  tennessee manufacturing facility  which will increase our capabilities in the nonresidential construction sector  accounted for million of capital expenditures in depreciation expense for continuing operations was million in  a decrease of from million in  and is projected to be million in on february   we sold our aluminum extrusions business in canada for approximately million to an affiliate of hig capital 
we realized cash income tax benefits in from the sale of approximately million 
all historical results for this business have been reflected as discontinued operations 
other developments net pension income from continuing operations was million in  an unfavorable change of million from amounts recognized in most of the change is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the operating profit by segment table presented on page we contributed approximately  to our pension plans for continuing operations in  and minimum required contributions to our pension plans in are expected to be comparable 
the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans at december  is approximately million at a weighted average discount rate of  and net pension expense in is estimated at million 
corporate expenses  net in increased in comparison to prima rily due to adjustments made to accruals for certain performance based compensation programs and the unfavorable change in pension income noted above 
interest expense  which includes the amortization of debt issue costs  was  in  a million decline versus  primarily due to reduced average debt levels and lower average interest rates 
the effective tax rate used to compute income taxes from continuing operations was in compared with in the change in the effective tax rate for continuing operations for versus was due to numerous factors as shown in the effective income tax rate reconciliation provided in note on page on april   we invested million in harbinger capital partners special situations fund  lp harbinger  a fund that seeks to achieve superior absolute returns by participating primarily in medium to long term investments involving distressed high yield debt securities  special situation equities and private loans and notes 
the fund is a highly speculative investment and subject to limitations on withdrawal 
there is no secondary market for interests in the fund 
our investment in harbinger  which represents less than of harbinger s total partnership capital  is accounted for under the cost method 
at december   harbinger reported our capital account value at million versus the carrying value of million included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet 
see discussion of investment accounted for under the fair value method on page in  we repurchased  shares of our stock under a standing authorization from our board of directors at an average price of per share  compared to million shares of stock repurchased in at an average price of 
due to strong cash flows from operations  our net cash balance cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of million was million at december   compared to net cash cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of million of million at december  net cash is not intended to represent debt or cash as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  but is utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation and we believe that in vestors also may find net debt or cash helpful for the same purposes 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december st of each year 
our reporting units include film products and aluminum extrusions  each of which may have separately identifiable operating net assets operating assets including goodwill and intangible assets net of operating liabilities 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and comparative enterprise value to ebitda multiples 
these calculations require us to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based on the severity of the economic downturn and its impact on sales volumes of our aluminum extrusions business a decline in sales volume in the first quarter of compared with the first quarter of  the resulting first quarter loss  possible future losses and the uncertainty in the amount and timing of an economic recovery  we determined that impairment indicators existed 
upon completing the impairment analysis as of march   a goodwill impairment charge of million  which represents the entire amount of goodwill associated with aluminum extrusions  was recorded 
based upon assessments performed as to the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets  we have recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations of million in  million in and  in for asset impairments relating to discontinued operations  see note to the notes to financial statements 
investment accounted for under the fair value method on august   we invested million in a privately held drug delivery company that is developing and commercializing state of the art drug delivery systems designed to improve patient compliance and outcomes 
on december   we invested an additional million as part of a new round of equity financing completed by the investee 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives are similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   our ownership interest was approximately on a fully diluted basis 
us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the dates of our investments august  and december   we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to the last round of financing  and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates drop to level inputs since there i s no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  the company currently has no product sales 
accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or any other significant financial transaction  fair value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 
in connection with the new round of equity financing in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an unrealized gain of million for the write up of this investment based upon the implied valuation of our ownership interest 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an additional unrealized gain of million for the appreciation of our ownership interest upon the investee entering into an exclusive licensing agreement that included an upfront payment  additional potential milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license 
at december  and  the fair value of our investment the carrying value included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet was million and 
million  respectively 
the fair market valuation of our interest in the drug delivery company is sensitive to changes in the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flow projections for the high degree of risk associated with meeting development and commercialization milestones as anticipated 
at december   the effect of a basis point change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have increased or decreased the fair value of our interest in the drug delivery company by approximately million 
any future changes in the estimated fair value of our ownership interest will likely be attributed to a new round of financing  a merger or initial public offering or adjustments to the timing or magnitude of cash flows associated with development and commercialization milestones 
adjustments to the estimated fair value of our investment will be made in the period upon which such changes can be quantified 
pension benefits we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income or expense recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
our weighted average discount rate for continuing operations was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of not applicable in and 
based on plan changes announced in  pay for active participants of the plan was frozen as of december  a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations increased million  or  in  partially recovering from an million decline in the asset value decline in was primarily due to the drop in global stock prices 
between and  the value of our plan assets relating to continuing operations increased due to improved general market conditions after declining from to our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is primarily based on estimated market and economic conditions as well as asset mix  was in  from to  in and in and prior years 
we anticipate that our expected long term return on plan assets will be for fiscal year see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
included in the  and amounts were  million and million  respectively  for tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which the timing of deductibility is uncertain 
because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting  other than interest  penalties and deductions not related to timing  a longer deductibility period would not affect the total income tax expense or the annual effective tax rate shown for financial reporting purposes  but would accelerate payments to the taxing authority 
tax payments r esulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority for accelerated deductions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately  million and million at december   and  respectively   and  respectively  net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
in  we settled several disputed issues raised by the internal revenue service the irs during its examination of our us income tax returns for  the most significant of which regards the recognition of our captive insurance subsidiary as an insurance company for us income tax purposes 
the settlement with the irs for the disputed issues cost us approximately million  which is lower than the previous estimate of million and was applied against the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 
tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us  various states and jurisdictions outside the us generally  except for refund claims and amended returns  tredegar is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december  and  we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the information that an entity must provide in its financial statements surrounding a transfer of financial assets and the effect of the transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
these new accounting rules are effective as of the beginning of the annual period beginning after november  we do not expect these fasb rules to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
the fasb also provided guidance in june that clarifies and improves financial reporting by entities involved with variable interest entities 
the revised statement amends previous guidance to require an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this new accounting standard is effective for annual periods beginning after november  we do not expect these fasb ru les to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
in october  the fasb emerging issues task force issued a consensus updating accounting standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the stated objective of the accounting standards update was to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
the revision of current fasb guidance provides amended methodologies for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands disclosure requirements 
the accounting standards update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adopti on permitted 
we do not expect these fasb rules to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
the fasb issued guidance in january that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this update also clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about the purchase  sale  issuance and settlement activity of level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for the interim periods in that year 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures

changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
see the executive summary beginning on page and the business segment review beginning on page for discussion regarding the impact of the lag in the pass through of resin price changes 
the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products is shown in the chart below 
source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using monthly data provided by chemical data inc cdi 
in january  cdi reflected a cents per pound non market adjustment based on their estimate of the growth of discounts over the to period 
the th quarter average rate of cents per pound is shown on a pro forma basis as if the non market adjustment was made in october resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days see the executive summary on page and the business segment review on page for more information 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 
source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using daily closing data provided by bloomberg 
in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the continuing monthly operating profit for our us operations in aluminum extrusions 
in september  we announced an energy surcharge for our aluminum extrusions business in the us to be applied when the previous quarter s nymex natural gas average settlement price is in excess of per mmbtu

exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency exposure on income from continuing foreign operations relates to the euro  the chinese yuan  the hungarian forint and the brazilian real 
in film products  where we are typically able to match the currency of our sales and costs  we estimate that the change in value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had a negative impact on operating profit of approximately million in compared with  a positive impact of million in compared with and a positive impact of million in compared with trends for the euro and chinese yuan are shown in the chart below source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using daily closing data provided by bloomberg
