item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents power costs 
in addition to price changes resulting from the general rate case process  the opuc has approved the following mechanisms by which pge can adjust retail customer prices to cover the company s nvpc  which consists of direct and indirect costs of power and fuel less revenues from wholesale electricity sales annual power cost update tariff 
under this tariff  customer prices are adjusted annually to reflect the latest forecast of nvpc 
such forecasts assume average regional hydro conditions based on a year regulation study covering the period utilized in the company s most recent general rate case  with no adjustments for updated hydro projections 
an initial forecast  submitted to the opuc by april each year  is updated during the year and finalized in november 
based upon the final forecast  new prices  as approved by the opuc  become effective at the beginning of the next calendar year  and power cost adjustment mechanism pcam 
customer prices can also be adjusted to reflect a portion of the difference between each year s forecasted nvpc included in prices and actual nvpc for the year 
under the pcam  pge is subject to a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the difference between actual nvpc and that included in base prices 
the pcam utilizes an asymmetrical deadband within which pge absorbs cost variances  with a sharing of such variances between customers and the company outside of the deadband 
annual results of the pcam are subject to application of a regulated earnings test  with final determination of any customer refund or collection made by the opuc through a public filing and review

renewable energy 
the oregon renewable energy act the act established a renewable energy standard res which requires that pge serve at least of its retail load within the state from renewable resources from through  for through  for through  and in and subsequent years 
pge anticipates that it will meet the requirement of the act with existing or currently planned renewable resources 
further  the company expects that  with additional resources included in its currently proposed integrated resource plan  it will meet the requirement 
it is anticipated that subsequent years requirements will be met by the acquisition of additional renewable resources  as determined pursuant to the company s integrated resource planning process 
for additional information  see the power supply section in this item the act also provides for the recovery in customer rates of all prudently incurred costs required to comply with the res 
under a renewable adjustment clause rac mechanism  pge can recover the revenue requirement of new renewable resources and associated transmission that are not yet included in rates 
under the rac  pge submits a filing on april of each year for new renewable resources being placed in service in the current year  with rates to become effective january st of the following year 
in addition  the rac provides for the deferral of eligible costs incurred prior to january st of the following year 
for additional information  see the legal  regulatory and environmental matters discussion in the overview section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other ratemaking proceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs  programs  or activities  as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recorded pursuant to specific opuc authorization 
such amounts are generally collected from  or refunded to  retail customers through the use of supplemental tariffs 
utility rate treatment of income taxes in  oregon adopted senate bill sb 
the law attempts to more closely match income tax amounts forecasted to be collected in revenues with the amount of income taxes paid to governmental entities by investor owned electric and natural gas utilities or their consolidated group 
the law requires that utilities file a report with the opuc each year regarding the amount of taxes paid by the utility with certain adjustments  as well as the amount of taxes authorized to be collected in rates  as defined by the 
table of contents statute 
this report is filed by october th of the year following the reporting year 
if the opuc determines that the difference between the two amounts is greater than  the utility is required to adjust future rates  with a regulatory asset or liability recorded for the total amount including accrued interest to be collected from  or refunded to  retail customers 
application of the provisions of sb can  in certain situations  result in unusual outcomes  commonly termed the double whammy effect 
as the provisions of the law apply to pge  if the company records higher actual operating income than forecast in its latest general rate case  customers are surcharged for the resulting increase in income taxes  further increasing earnings 
conversely  if the company records lower actual operating income than forecast in its latest rate case  customers receive refunds for the resulting decrease in income taxes  further decreasing earnings

retail customer choice program this program allows pge s commercial and industrial customers direct access to other suppliers of electricity electricity service suppliers  or esss 
while such customers can purchase their electricity from other suppliers  pge continues to deliver the energy 
the program provides for transition adjustments that reflect the above or below market cost of energy resources owned or purchased by the utility  with such adjustments designed to ensure that such costs or benefits do not unfairly shift to the utility s remaining energy customers 
the retail customer choice program is intended to have no material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
in addition to opting out of cost of service for terms of one year or less to be served by an ess  pge also offers an option by which certain large non residential customers may elect to be removed from cost of service pricing for a fixed three year or a minimum five year term 
in  esss supplied pge customers with a total average load of approximately mwa  representing of pge s non residential load and of the company s total retail load for the year 
in early  the four esss registered to transact business with pge supply an average load of approximately mwa  representing of the company s non residential load and of total retail load 
daily and monthly market price options are also available to pge s commercial and industrial customers 
at the end of  pge served customers with a total load of mwa under such options  representing of nonresidential load and less than of total retail load 
pge served the remaining of nonresidential load under cost of service or other portfolio options 
residential and small commercial customers can purchase electricity from pge from a portfolio of rate options that include a basic cost of service rate  a time of use rate  and renewable resource rates 
as of december   approximately  customers were enrolled in renewable energy options  with  enrolled in time of use options 
as of december   approximately  customers were enrolled in renewable energy options  with  enrolled in time of use options 
energy efficiency funding oregon s electricity restructuring law also provides for a public purpose charge to fund cost effective energy efficiency measures  new renewable energy resources  and weatherization measures for low income housing 
this charge  equal to of retail revenues  is collected from customers and remitted to the energy trust of oregon eto and other agencies for administration of these programs 
in and  approximately million and million  respectively  were billed to customers for this charge 
pge also remits to the eto amounts collected under an energy efficiency adjustment tariff to fund additional energy efficiency measures 
the tariff  which became effective on june   included an approximate charge for eligible customers  providing about million annually for measures that enable customers to reduce their energy use 
effective january   the charge was increased to approximately  which is expected to provide about million annually 

table of contents decoupling pursuant to opuc authorization in pge s most recent general rate case general rate case  the company is deferring  for later ratemaking treatment  amounts associated with a new decoupling mechanism 
the mechanism is intended to provide for recovery of reduced revenues resulting from a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency and conservation efforts by residential and certain commercial customers 
it also provides for customer refunds if weather adjusted use per customer exceeds that approved in the rate case 
for  pge accrued a refund to customers of million  as weather adjusted use per customer for the year exceeded that approved in the rate case 
regulatory accounting as a regulated public utility  pge is subject to generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its financial statements 
these principles provide for the deferral as regulatory assets of certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense  based on expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on expected future credits or refunds to customers 
pge records regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that they will be allowed for recovery or refund in future rates  based on regulatory orders or other available evidence 
the company periodically assesses the applicability of regulatory accounting to its business  considering both the current and anticipated future rate environment and related accounting guidance

retail revenues retail customers are categorized into residential  commercial  and industrial classes  with no single customer representing more than of pge s total retail revenues or of total retail deliveries 
commercial and industrial customer classes are not dominated by any single industry 
while the largest commercial and industrial customers constituted of total retail revenues in  they represented nine different groups  including retail  high technology  paper manufacturing  metal fabrication  health services and governmental agencies 
additional information on these customer classes follows 

table of contents residential customers include single family housing  multiple family housing such as apartments  duplexes and townhomes  mobile homes  and small farms 
pricing of service to the residential class is based on the costs pge incurs to provide electric service  unless the customer has selected time of use or renewable resource pricing 
on average for the last three years  residential customers have comprised of total customers  provided of total retail revenues  and accounted for of total retail energy deliveries 
residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather  with demand historically highest during the winter heating season although  due to the increased use of air conditioning in pge s service territory  the summer peaks have increased in recent years 
the state of the economy also affects demand from the company s residential customers 
historical data has suggested that a increase in oregon s unemployment rate has resulted in an approximate decrease in total demand from the company s residential customers 
during  however  when the unemployment rate increased about  total residential deliveries remained comparable to commercial customers consist of non residential customers who accept delivery at voltages equivalent to that delivered to residential customers 
this customer class includes most commercial businesses  as well as small industrial customers and public street and highway lighting  with pricing based on the amount of electricity used 
on average for the last three years  commercial customers comprised of total customers  provided of total retail revenues  and accounted for of total retail energy deliveries 
demand from the company s commercial customers is generally not affected significantly by weather  however  demand can be affected by total employment in the region 
typically  a change in oregon s total employment can lead to an approximate change in demand from the company s commercial customers 
during  as the oregon economy lost about of its payroll  the company s commercial energy deliveries decreased compared to industrial customers consist of non residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers  with pricing based on the amount of electricity used and applicable tariff rate 
on average for the last three years  industrial customers have comprised less than of total customers  provided of total retail revenues  and accounted for of total retail energy deliveries 
demand from industrial customers is primarily affected by national and global economic conditions 
weather has little impact on this customer class 
typically  a change in oregon s total employment can lead to an approximate change in demand from the company s industrial customers 
although the oregon economy lost about of its payroll in  total energy deliveries to industrial customers decreased in compared to direct access customers consist of commercial and industrial customers who purchase their electricity from an ess  with pge delivering the electricity 
the revenue earned in connection with the transmission and delivery of this electricity  net of transition adjustments  is included in other retail revenues 
pge served an average of direct access customer accounts in  in  and in the number of ess customers  deliveries  and revenues are included among the figures discussed above for the company s total commercial and industrial customers 
residential exchange program rep under the rep  the bonneville power administration bpa provides federal hydropower benefits to residential and small farm customers of certain investor owned electric utilities 
under the program  pge receives monthly payments from bpa and passes such payments along to eligible customers in the form of monthly billing credits 
in may  the bpa suspended payments under the program  which resulted in an approximate average price increase to the company s eligible customers 
benefits were partially restored on a temporary basis in april  which reduced prices for residential and small farm customers by an average of 
in september  the bpa and pge entered into an agreement that provides for monthly payments through the term of the agreement  which extends to september for the twelve month period ended september  
table of contents  pge received payments totaling approximately million 
payments for the twelve month periods ending september  and are expected to be approximately million and million  respectively  with benefits to be credited to eligible customers 
the company will continue to pursue ongoing benefits for its customers under the rep 
wholesale revenues pge participates in the wholesale marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts 
the company s wholesale market participation includes purchases and sales of power resulting from economic dispatch decisions for its own generation  which allows pge to secure reasonably priced power for its customers  and purchases and sales of natural gas 
interconnected transmission systems in the western united states serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power  water conditions  and seasonal demand 
the majority of pge s wholesale sales are to utilities and power marketers and are predominantly short term 
the company may net purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power  with only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations physically settled 
other operating revenues other includes sales of natural gas or oil in excess of generating plant requirements and revenues from transmission services and excess transmission capacity resales  pole contact rentals  and certain other electric services to customers 
seasonality seasonal demand for electricity by pge s residential customers is affected by weather conditions  as discussed above 
heating and cooling degree days are common measures used to analyze the effect of weather on the demand for electricity 
heating and cooling degree days  which measure how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees  indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use electricity for heating or air conditioning 
the higher the numbers of degree days  the greater the expected demand for heating or cooling 
the following table indicates the heating and cooling degree days for the most recent three year period  along with year averages provided by the national weather service  as measured at portland international airport heating degree days cooling degree days year average for the table indicates that during  demand for heating was greater than the year average  but less than what it was in demand for electricity for air conditioning was also greater in than it was in  which was a near average cooling degree year 
the company tracks both base load growth and peak capacity for purposes of long term load forecasting and resource planning 
pge s all time high net system load peak of  mw occurred in december the company s all time summer peak of  mw  driven by unusually warm weather  occurred in july and exceeded the december winter peak of  mw 
pge s average load was  mwa for the winter and  mwa for the summer in  compared to  mwa for the winter and  mwa for the summer in 
table of contents power supply pge relies upon its generating resources as well as short and long term power purchase contracts to meet its customers energy requirements 
the company executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation  and participates in the wholesale market as a result of those economic dispatch decisions  in an effort to obtain reasonably priced power for its retail customers 
pge s base generating resources consist of five thermal plants  seven hydroelectric plants  and wind farms located at biglow canyon 
the volume of electricity the company generates is dependent upon  among other factors  the capacity and availability of its generating resources 
capacity of a given plant represents the mw the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions  net of electricity used in the operation of the plant 
the capacity of the company s thermal generating resources is also affected by ambient temperatures 
availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations  which reflects the impact of planned  forced and maintenance outages 
for a complete listing of these facilities  see item properties 
the company also promotes the expansion of renewable energy resources  as well as energy efficiency measures  to meet such needs and enhance customers ability to manage their energy use more efficiently

pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available for coyote springs  based on anticipated operation of the plant 
although coyote springs was designed to also operate on oil  such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations 
purchased power pge supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its energy requirements 
the company utilizes short and long term wholesale power purchase contracts to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis 
such contracts have terms ranging from one month to years and expire at varying dates through pge s medium term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions 
the strategy allows the company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery 
by purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period  pge attempts to mitigate volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel from year to year 
the company s major power purchase contracts consist of the following also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts capacity exchange these five contracts provide pge with firm capacity to help meet the company s peak loads

future energy resource strategy periodically  pge is required to file with the opuc an integrated resource plan irp  which guides the utility on how it will meet future customer demand and describes the company s energy supply strategy for the coming years  reflecting new technologies  market conditions  and regulatory requirements 
the primary goal of the irp is to identify an acquisition plan for generation  transmission  demand side and energy efficiency resources that  along with the company s existing portfolio  provides the best combination of expected cost and associated risks and uncertainties for pge and its customers 
on november   pge filed a new irp that includes a four year strategy for the acquisition of new resources and a year strategy that outlines long term expectations for resource needs and portfolio performance 
pge projects that it will need mwa of new resources by  increasing to  mwa by  to meet expected customer demand 
such projected energy gaps are driven primarily by continued load growth and the expiration of certain long term power supply contracts and will be updated periodically for any changes in underlying assumptions 
to meet the projected energy gap  the irp includes energy efficiency measures  new renewable resources  new transmission capability  new generating plants  and improvements to existing generating plants as follows acquisition of mwa of energy efficiency through continuation of energy trust of oregon programs  with funding to be provided from the existing public purpose charge and through enabling legislation included in oregon s renewable energy standard

as part of this irp  pge plans to install emissions controls at its boardman plant to reduce the plant s haze causing emissions  including airborne mercury 
after filing the irp  pge determined that it will consider an alternative operating plan for boardman  under which the plant will either discontinue the use of pulverized coal as a fuel source  or cease operations in and be replaced with a new base load resource 
as a result  the company requested that the opuc delay consideration of the irp to allow for additional analysis 
the company intends to file an addendum to its irp during march  following the presentation of the company s proposal to intervenors in this matter 
the company has also agreed to submit a final proposed irp schedule following discussions with intervenors 
pursuant to the final schedule  the opuc will review pge s irp and accept public comments before issuing an order concerning acknowledgment of the plan

environmental matters pge s operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  including those related to air and water quality  climate change  noise  endangered species  and waste disposal 
various state and federal agencies have jurisdiction over environmental matters that include the siting and operation of generation  transmission  and substation facilities and the accumulation  cleanup  and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances 
in addition  certain of the company s hydroelectric projects and transmission system facilities are located on property under the jurisdiction of federal  tribal  and or state agencies which have authority in environmental protection matters 
air quality standards clean air act pge s operations  primarily its thermal generating plants  are subject to the federal clean air act caa 
primary pollutants addressed by the caa that affect pge are sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxides  carbon monoxide  and particulate matter 
state governments  including oregon  also monitor and administer certain portions of the caa and must set standards that are at least equal to federal standards 
pge manages its air emissions by the use of low sulfur fuel  emissions controls and monitoring  and combustion controls 
the so emissions allowances awarded under the caa  along with expected future annual allowances  are anticipated to be sufficient to permit the company to operate its thermal generating plants at forecasted capacity for at least the next several years within the limitations of current so emissions requirements 

table of contents mercury rules the states in which pge facilities are located have adopted the following regulations concerning mercury emissions that are likely to have an impact on the company s boardman and colstrip plants the montana board of environmental review adopted final rules on mercury emissions from coal fired generating plants in montana  including colstrip  which required compliance with mercury emission limits by january  with the installation of additional mercury control systems now completed  the colstrip plants are expected to meet these requirements 
the oregon environmental quality commission oeqc has adopted final rules on mercury emissions from the state s coal fired generating plants  including boardman 
such rules require compliance with stated mercury limits by july   although this deadline can be extended by two years under certain circumstances 
pge has submitted its mercury control plan to the oregon department of environmental quality deq outlining measures it will take to comply with the state s mercury emissions rules 
regional haze rules in accordance with federal regional haze rules aimed at visibility impairment in certain federally protected areas  the deq conducted an assessment of emission sources that has indicated that boardman contributes to visibility impairment in several federally protected areas and would be subject to a regional haze best available retrofit technology determination  as required under the caa 
in june  the oeqc adopted a rule that would require the installation of emissions controls at boardman in phases  with estimated completion by the oeqc rule has been submitted to the environmental protection agency epa for approval as part of the oregon regional haze state implementation plan sip 
the company expects the epa to issue a decision on the sip in based on requirements outlined in the oeqc s rule and current market conditions for air quality equipment  pge estimates that the approximate cost of the controls required by the rule would be between million and million of total costs  excluding allowance for funds used during construction  or afdc 
pge has no commitments in place at this time and cautions that the cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change 
pge will seek recovery of such costs through the ratemaking process 
in pge s november irp filing  given the options provided by the oeqc of either ceasing operation of boardman or installing controls and continuing operations  the company recommended the continued operation of boardman through with the addition of the controls required by the oeqc 
continuing discussions with irp stakeholders indicate support for the analysis of an alternative strategy regarding boardman 
the company is committed to seeking the best plan for providing reliable and reasonably priced electricity for customers 
accordingly  pge has informed the opuc that the company intends to pursue an alternative operating plan for boardman that would allow the operation of boardman through with only the mercury controls and low nitrogen oxide burners 
pge has requested  and the opuc has granted  suspension of the irp proceedings to allow the company sufficient opportunity to prepare an alternative boardman operating plan for inclusion in the irp 
for additional information  see boardman emissions controls in the capital requirements section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the alternative plan  using a timeline  would allow the company time to plan and implement an appropriate replacement strategy for boardman if the plant were to close 
current options under consideration include construction of a new plant or the use of an alternative fuel to operate boardman 
pge would seek to recover in future rates its remaining investment in boardman approximately million as of december  plus the cost of the mercury controls  low nitrogen oxide burners and decommissioning and other costs related to the plant s closure  as well as the construction or acquisition costs of replacement generating capacity 

table of contents if agreement with all regulatory bodies cannot be reached to allow for an alternative operating plan for boardman  pge will continue to seek approval for installation of all required emissions controls and continued operation of the plant 
climate change greenhouse gas ghg emissions and their potential impacts on climate change have received increased public attention  with state  regional  and federal legislative efforts initiated to establish mandatory controls 
recent or pending environmental measures include the following in  the state of oregon adopted a goal to reduce ghg emissions to below levels by the non binding goal does not mandate reductions by any specific entity nor does it include penalties for failure to meet the goal  however  it serves as a policy guideline for the state 
in june  the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of  which seeks to establish a cap and trade system for ghg emissions 
debate in the us senate on similar legislation is continuing 
the epa has made it mandatory  effective january   for certain companies  including pge  to measure and report ghg emissions 
reported data will be used to establish a baseline for measuring progress toward any future emissions reduction targets in the united states 
the oregon emissions performance standard  passed by the oregon legislature in  prohibits utilities from entering longer than five year commitments with energy facilities  or contracts for energy  for which the associated emissions exceed prescribed levels 
this standard may have an impact on the company s ability to contract for  or prices it pays to acquire  energy to meet future customer needs 
other states in the western electricity grid  including washington and california  have also enacted similar legislation 
any laws that impose mandatory reductions in ghg emissions could have a material impact on pge  as the company utilizes fossil fuels in its own power generation and other companies use such fuels to generate power that pge purchases in the wholesale market 
pge s beaver  coyote springs  and port westward natural gas fired facilities  and the company s interest in boardman and colstrip coal fired facilities  provide approximately of the company s net generating capacity 
the ultimate impact that the above regulatory requirements and emissions controls will have on future operations  costs  or generating capacity of pge s thermal generating facilities is not yet determinable and is being evaluated as part of the integrated resource planning process 
water quality and endangered species protection water quality the federal clean water act requires that any federal license or permit to conduct an activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the united states must first receive a water quality certification from the state in which the activity will occur 
in oregon  the deq is responsible for reviewing proposed projects under this requirement to ensure that federally approved activities will meet water quality standards and policies established by the state 
pge has certificates of compliance for its hydroelectric operations under the ferc license agreements 
fish protection populations of many migratory fish species in the pacific northwest have declined significantly over the last several decades 
many of these distinct populations have been granted protection under the federal endangered species act esa 
as a result  long term recovery plans for these species include major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects  which have resulted in reductions in hydroelectric generation capacity and the seasonal shifting of hydroelectric generation from the fall and winter periods to the spring and summer periods 
pge has purchase contracts for power generated at affected facilities on the 
table of contents mid columbia river in central washington and may be adversely affected by such reductions and seasonal shifting at those facilities 
the timing of stored water releases also affects the availability and prices of power in the regional wholesale market 
pge is implementing a series of fish protection measures at its hydroelectric generation projects on the clackamas  deschutes  and willamette rivers that were prescribed by the us fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service under their authority granted in the esa 
as a result of measures contained in their operating license agreements  the pelton round butte and willamette river projects have been certified as low impact hydro  with a portion of their output included as part of the company s renewable energy portfolio used to meet the requirements of oregon s renewable energy standard 
the following are related to conditions outlined in the company s ferc operating license agreements ferc approval of a year license term for the company s four hydroelectric projects on the clackamas river is expected in operating conditions proposed in the new license could result in a reduction in power production 
pending issuance of a new license  the project is operating under annual licenses issued by the ferc 
as required by the ferc license for its pelton round butte project on the deschutes river  which is in effect until  pge constructed a selective water withdrawal system in an effort to restore fish passage on the upper portion of the river 
the system  which was placed in service in january  is designed to collect juvenile salmon and steelhead  allowing them to bypass the dam when migrating to the pacific ocean 
the system will also help regulate downstream water temperature 
as required under the ferc license for its willamette river hydroelectric project  in effect until  pge implemented several fish protection measures  the performance of which will receive ongoing evaluation 
decommissioning of pge s former bull run hydroelectric project  located in the sandy river basin  has been substantially completed under a ferc surrender order 
the project is no longer operating and remaining activity consists primarily of the removal and disposition of certain minor facilities 
avian protection various statutory authorities as well as the migratory bird treaty act have established civil  criminal  and administrative penalties for the unauthorized take of migratory birds 
operation of electric transmission lines and wind generation projects can pose risks to a variety of such birds 
pge has developed and implemented an avian protection plan to reduce risks to bird species that can result from company operations 
hazardous waste pge has a comprehensive program to comply with requirements of both federal and state regulations related to hazardous waste storage  handling and disposal 
the handling and disposal of hazardous waste from company facilities is subject to regulation under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
in addition  the use  disposal  and clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls  contained in certain electrical equipment  are regulated by the federal toxic substances control act 
pge is also subject to regulation under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  referred to as superfund 
cercla can assert joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs for designated superfund sites 
pge is currently listed by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites discussed as follows portland harbor a investigation by the epa of a segment of the willamette river  known as the portland harbor  revealed significant contamination of river sediments 
the epa subsequently included portland harbor on the federal national priority list as a superfund site pursuant to cercla and listed sixty nine prps  including pge  which has historically owned or operated property near the river 

table of contents harbor oil the harbor oil site in north portland is the location of a company that pge engaged to process used oil from power plants and electrical distribution systems until the harbor oil facility continues to be utilized by other entities for the processing of used oil and other lubricants 
in september  the harbor oil site was included on the federal national priority list as a federal superfund site

under the nuclear waste policy act of  the us department of energy usdoe is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
pge has contracted with the usdoe for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel for trojan that is stored in the independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi  an nrc licensed interim dry storage facility that houses the fuel at the plant site 
the spent nuclear fuel is expected to remain at the isfsi until permanent off site storage is available  which is not likely to be before shipment of the spent nuclear fuel from the isfsi to off site storage is not expected to be completed prior to

risk factors 
certain risks and uncertainties that could have a significant impact on pge s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  or that may cause the company s actual results to vary from the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k  include  but are not limited to  those set forth below 
recovery of pge s costs is subject to regulatory review and approval  and the inability to recover costs may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the prices that the opuc authorizes pge to charge for its retail services are a major factor in determining the company s operating income  financial position  liquidity  and credit ratings 
the opuc has the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred 
furthermore  the regulatory process does not provide assurance that pge will be able to achieve the earnings level authorized 
although the opuc is required to establish rates that are fair  just and reasonable  it has significant discretion in determining the application of this standard 
in pge s general rate case  the company s initial proposal included an overall rate increase of  compared to a overall increase approved by the opuc 
the company attempts to manage costs at levels consistent with the reduced rate increase 
however  if the company is unable to do so  or if such cost management results in increased operational risk  the reduced rate increase could adversely affect the company s operations or results of operations 
on february   pge filed with the opuc a general rate case with a test year general rate case 
this general rate case seeks to more closely align customer prices with the company s cost structure 
there can be no assurance that the opuc will approve the rate increase sought by pge in this case 
for additional information regarding the general rate case  see the overview section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
pge utilizes a pcam by which the company can adjust future prices to reflect a portion of the difference between each year s forecasted and actual nvpc 
use of the approved cost sharing methodology requires that pge absorb certain power cost increases before the company is allowed to recover any amount from customers 
accordingly  application of the pcam is expected to only partially mitigate the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages  severe weather  reduced hydro availability  and volatile wholesale energy prices 
in  pge s actual nvpc exceeded the baseline nvpc included in prices by million 
as this amount was below the threshold for recovery under the pcam  pge absorbed these increased costs 
the current economic downturn has reduced the demand for electricity and has impaired the financial soundness of many customers  which has adversely affected pge s results of operations and could continue to do so 
the economic slow down has resulted in a rise in oregon s average unemployment rate to for from for and for  compared to the national average unemployment rate of for oregon s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased to in december compared to in december the slowing of the oregon and national economies has resulted in reduced demand for electricity and could result in a continued reduction in such demand 
this reduced demand has adversely affected the company s results of operations and cash flow and could continue to do so 
as a result of the economic slow down  pge experienced  among other unfavorable trends  the following in a decrease of in energy deliveries to industrial customers from  and the sale of electricity  originally intended to meet forecasted retail load requirements  into a depressed wholesale market 

table of contents in addition  the company s uncollectible customer accounts increased in compared to if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  amounts owed to the company 
the inability of customers to pay the company could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flow 
furthermore  as a result of the current economic downturn affecting the economies of the state of oregon  the united states and other parts of the world  the company s vendors and service providers could experience serious cash flow problems 
as a result  pge s vendors and service providers may be unable to perform under existing contracts or may significantly increase their prices or reduce their output or performance on future contracts 
the construction of new generating facilities  or modifications to existing facilities  is subject to risks that could result in the disallowance of certain costs for recovery in prices  reduced plant efficiency  or higher operating costs 
long term increases in both the number of customers and demand for energy will require continued expansion and reinforcement of pge s generation  transmission  and distribution systems 
construction of new generating facilities  or modifications to existing facilities  could be affected by various factors  including unanticipated delays and cost increases  which could result in the disallowance of certain costs in the rate determination process 
in addition  the failure to complete construction projects according to specifications could result in reduced plant efficiency  equipment failure  and plant performance that falls below expected levels  which could increase operating costs 
adverse changes in pge s credit ratings could negatively affect its access to the capital markets and its cost of borrowed funds 
access to capital markets is important to pge s ability to operate and to complete its ongoing capital projects  including biglow canyon phase iii  the smart meter project  and ongoing upgrades and replacements of transmission  distribution and generation infrastructure 
in their normal course of business  credit rating agencies re examine pge s credit ratings on a periodic basis and when certain events occur 
a ratings downgrade could increase the interest rates and fees on pge s revolving credit facilities  increasing the cost of funding day to day working capital requirements  and could also result in higher interest rates on future long term debt 
a ratings downgrade could also restrict the company s access to the commercial paper market  a principal source of short term financing  or result in higher interest costs 
in addition  if moody s investor service moody s and or standard and poor s ratings services s p reduce their rating on the company s unsecured debt to below investment grade  pge could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral  which could have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect the company s access to capital  cost of capital  and ability to execute its business plan as currently scheduled 
access to capital and credit markets is important to pge s ability to operate 
the company faces significant capital requirements in and for the next few years and expects to issue debt and equity securities in order to fund certain major projects 
in addition  because of contractual commitments and regulatory requirements  the company has limited ability to delay or terminate these projects  which include biglow canyon phase iii and the smart meter project in for additional information concerning pge s capital requirements  see capital requirements in the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if the capital and credit market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world deteriorate  the company s future cost of debt and equity capital  as well as access to capital markets  could be adversely affected 
in addition  restrictions on pge s ability to access capital markets could affect its ability to execute its business plan as currently scheduled 

table of contents adverse market performance could result in reductions in the fair market value of benefit plan assets and increase the company s liabilities related to such plans 
sustained depreciation of the fair value of the plans assets could result in significant increases in funding requirements  adversely affecting pge s liquidity and results of operations 
performance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s defined benefit pension plan 
sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the company and could increase pge s funding requirements related to the pension plan 
additionally  changes in interest rates affect the company s liabilities under the pension plan 
as interest rates decrease  the company s liabilities increase  potentially requiring additional funding 
during  the value of the pension plan assets declined substantially  contributing to the pension plan s underfunded status of million as of december  during  the value of the pension plan assets appreciated and changes in certain actuarial assumptions resulted in an improvement in the underfunded status of the pension plan to million as of december  as a result  the company expects to make no contribution to the pension plan in and a million contribution in  pursuant to the requirements of the federal pension protection act 
performance of the capital markets also affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s non qualified employee benefit plans  which include deferred compensation plans and a supplemental executive retirement plan 
as changes in the value of these assets are recorded in current earnings  decreases can adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  such decreases can require that pge make additional payments to satisfy its obligations under these plans 
in  pge recorded a loss on the fair value of these assets of million  which reduced net income by million for the year ended december   while in  pge recorded a gain of million  which increased net income by million for the year ended december  for additional information regarding pge s contribution obligations under its pension and non qualified benefit plans  see the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table in the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and pension and other postretirement plans in note  employee benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
market prices for power and natural gas are subject to forces that are often not predictable and which can result in price volatility  and general market disruption  adversely affecting pge s costs and ability to manage its energy portfolio and procure required energy supply  ultimately affecting the company s liquidity and results of operations 
pge purchases power and natural gas in the open market or pursuant to short term  long term or variable priced contracts as part of its normal business operations 
market prices for power and natural gas are influenced primarily by factors related to supply and demand 
these factors generally include the adequacy of generating capacity  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  hydroelectric generation levels  prices and availability of fuel sources for generation  disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities  weather conditions  economic growth  and changes in technology 
volatility in these markets can affect the availability  price and demand for power and natural gas 
disruption in power and natural gas markets could result in a deterioration of market liquidity  increase the risk of counterparty default  affect the regulatory and legislative process in unpredictable ways  affect wholesale power prices  and impair pge s ability to manage its energy portfolio 
changes in power and natural gas prices can also affect the market value of derivative instruments and cash requirements to purchase power and natural gas 
although the company s pcam can be expected to partially mitigate adverse financial effects related to market conditions  cost sharing features of the mechanism do not provide for full recovery in customer prices 
if power and natural gas prices decline relative to the terms of pge s existing purchased power and natural gas agreements  pge may be required to provide increased margin deposits in accordance with these purchased 
table of contents power and natural gas agreements which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
in the latter half of and into  as a result of depressed wholesale power and natural gas prices  pge was required to provide increased levels of margin deposits for its existing purchased power and natural gas agreements 
conversely  if power and natural gas prices rise  especially during periods when the company requires greater than expected volumes that must be purchased at market or short term prices  pge could incur greater costs than originally estimated 
the company may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through ratemaking 
pge is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings  the outcome of which is uncertain  and resolution unfavorable to pge could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
from time to time in the normal course of its business  pge is subject to various regulatory proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  which could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions  or other relief 
these actions are subject to many uncertainties and management cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
the final resolution of some of the matters in which pge is involved could require the company to make additional expenditures  in excess of established accruals  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on its cash flows and results of operations 
similarly  the terms of resolution could require the company to change its business practices and procedures  which could also have an adverse effect on its cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
there are certain pending legal and regulatory proceedings  such as those related to pge s recovery of its investment in trojan  the proceedings related to refunds on wholesale market transactions in the pacific northwest and the investigation and any resulting remediation efforts related to the portland harbor site  that may have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows for future reporting periods 
for additional information  see note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
legislative or regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could lead to increased capital and operating costs and have an adverse impact on the company s operations or results of operations 
pge expects that future federal  and possibly state  legislation or regulations may result in the imposition of limitations on greenhouse gas emissions from the company s fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would require greenhouse gas emission reductions from such generating facilities and other sectors of the economy 
no such legislation has yet been enacted  although the house of representatives passed climate legislation in june compliance with any greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements could require pge to incur significant expenditures  including those related to carbon capture and sequestration technology  purchase of emission allowances and or offsets  fuel switching  and or retirement of high emitting generation facilities and replacement with lower emitting generation facilities 
the cost to comply with expected greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements is subject to significant uncertainties  including those related to the timing of the implementation of emissions reduction rules  required levels of emissions reductions  requirements with respect to the allocation of emissions allowances  the maturation  regulation and commercialization of carbon capture and sequestration technology  and pge s compliance alternatives 
accordingly  the company cannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  the cost to comply with such requirements  however  could be material 
the company would likely seek to recover such costs through the ratemaking process 
however  there can be no assurance that such recovery would be granted 
forced outages at pge s generating plants can increase the cost of power required to serve customers because the cost of replacement power purchased in the wholesale market generally exceeds the company s cost of generation 
forced outages at the company s generating plants could result in power costs greater than those included in customer prices 
as indicated above  application of the company s pcam could help mitigate adverse financial 
table of contents impacts of such outages  however  full recovery is not assured 
inability to fully recover such costs in future rates could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
extended maintenance and repair outages at colstrip unit and boardman resulted in incremental replacement power costs of million in under certain circumstances  one or more of the banks participating in pge s credit facilities could decline to fund an advance requested by the company or could withdraw from participation in the credit facilities 
pge has revolving credit facilities with various banks for an aggregate amount available to the company for general corporate purposes of million 
these credit facilities supplement operating cash flow and provide a primary source of liquidity 
the credit facilities may also be used as backup for commercial paper borrowings 
the company is required to make certain representations to the banks each time it requests an advance under one of the credit facilities 
these credit facilities are commitments on the part of the banks to make loans and  in certain cases  to issue letters of credit 
however  in the event of the occurrence of certain events that could result in a material adverse change in the business  financial condition or results of operations of pge  the company may not be able to make certain representations  in which case the banks would not be required to lend 
pge is also subject to the risk that one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligation to make loans under the credit facilities 
in addition  it is possible that the company might not be aware of certain developments at the time it makes such a representation in connection with a request for an advance  which could cause the representation to be untrue at the time made and constitute an event of default 
such a circumstance could result in a loss of the banks commitments under the credit facilities and  in certain circumstances  an acceleration of repayment of any outstanding advance 
weather conditions that reduce stream flows  or unfavorable wind conditions  could adversely affect generation expected from pge s hydro and wind resources and increase the company s cost of generation or purchased power required to meet this energy gap 
pge derives a portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities and from hydroelectric facilities owned by certain public utility districts in the state of washington and the city of portland  with whom the company has long term power purchase contracts 
regional rainfall and snow pack levels affect stream flows and the resulting amount of generation available from these facilities 
shortfalls in low cost hydro production would require increased generation from the company s higher cost thermal plants and or power purchases in the wholesale market  which could have an adverse effect on operating results 
pge also derives a portion of its power supply from wind resources  output from which is dependent upon wind conditions 
unfavorable wind conditions could require increased reliance on power from the company s other generating resources or purchased power from the wholesale market  both of which would have an adverse effect on operating results 
although the application of the pcam could help mitigate adverse financial effects from any decrease in power provided by hydroelectric and wind resources  full recovery of any increase in power costs is not assured 
inability to fully recover such costs in future rates could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the effects of weather on electricity usage can adversely affect operating results 
weather conditions can adversely affect pge s revenues and costs  impacting the company s financial and operating results 
temperatures outside the normal range can affect customer demand for electricity  with 
table of contents warmer than normal winters or cooler than normal summers reducing energy sales and revenues 
weather conditions are the dominant cause of usage variations from normal seasonal patterns  particularly for residential customers 
severe weather can also disrupt energy delivery and damage the company s transmission and distribution system 
rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected adverse weather changes  particularly if coupled with transmission constraints  could adversely impact pge s cost and ability to meet the energy needs of its customers 
conversely  rapid decreases in load requirements could result in the sale of excess energy at depressed market prices 
measures required to comply with state and federal regulations related to emissions from thermal electric generating plants could result in increased capital expenditures and changes to pge s operations that could increase operating costs  reduce generating capacity and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in june  the oeqc adopted a rule as part of a separate regulatory process related to haze  mercury  and the company s air permits that would require the installation of emissions controls at boardman in three phases 
the oeqc s rule has been submitted to the epa for approval as part of the sip 
the company expects the epa to issue a decision on the sip in for additional information  see environmental matters in item business 
although the full impact of required state and federal remediation measures is not yet determinable  they could have an adverse effect on future operations  operating costs  and generating capacity at both boardman and colstrip 
the company would seek to recover through the ratemaking process any costs of additional emission control equipment or emission reduction measures that may be required 
however  there can be no assurance that such recovery would be granted 
in addition  pge could be subject to litigation brought by environmental groups and other private parties alleging violations of state or federal law and seeking the imposition of penalties  damages  injunctive relief  and the closure of plants

v 
portland general electric company in item legal proceedings 
failure of pge s wholesale suppliers to perform their contractual obligations could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver electricity and increase the company s costs 
pge relies on suppliers to deliver natural gas  coal and electricity  in accordance with short and long term contracts 
failure of suppliers to comply with such contracts in a timely manner could disrupt pge s ability to deliver electricity and require the company to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of its customers 
in addition  as these contracts expire  pge could be unable to continue to purchase natural gas  coal or electricity on terms and conditions equivalent to those of existing agreements 
cost and availability of natural gas and coal can also impact the cost and output of the company s thermal generating plants 
capital expenditures and changes in operations required to comply with both existing and new environmental laws related to fish and wildlife could adversely affect pge s results of operations 
a portion of pge s total energy requirement is comprised of generation from hydroelectric projects on the columbia  clackamas  deschutes  and willamette rivers 
operation of these projects is subject to extensive regulation related to the protection of fish and wildlife 
the listing of various species of salmon  wildlife  and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally authorized activities  including those of hydroelectric projects 
salmon recovery plans could include further major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects  including those owned by pge and those from which the company purchases 
table of contents power under long term contracts 
in addition  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to such facilities  which could further increase required expenditures for salmon recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydro generation available to meet the company s energy requirements 
the company would likely seek recovery of any such expenditures through the ratemaking process  however  there can be no assurance that such recovery would be granted 
storms and other natural disasters could damage the company s facilities and disrupt delivery of electricity resulting in significant property loss  repair costs  and reduced customer satisfaction 
the company has exposure to natural disasters that can cause significant damage to its generation  transmission  and distribution facilities 
such events can interrupt the delivery of electricity  increase repair and service restoration expenses  and reduce revenues 
such events  if repeated or prolonged  can also affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight 
as a regulated utility  the company is required to provide service to all customers within its service territory and generally has been afforded liability protection against customer claims related to service failures beyond the company s reasonable control 
to the extent reasonably possible  pge utilizes insurance to cost effectively mitigate the risk of physical loss or damage to the company s property  excluding transmission and distribution property  resulting from natural disasters  subject to certain coverage terms and conditions 
the company would likely seek recovery of large storm related losses to transmission and distribution property through the ratemaking process  however  there can be no assurance that any recovery would be granted 
if such recovery is not granted  these increased costs could have an adverse effect on pge s results of operations 
pge s business is subject to extensive regulation that affects the company s operations and costs 
pge is subject to regulation by the ferc and the opuc  and by federal  state and local authorities under environmental and other laws 
such regulation significantly influences the company s operating environment and affects many aspects of its business 
changes to regulations are ongoing  and the company cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on the company s business 
however  changes in these regulations could delay or adversely affect business planning and transactions  and substantially increase the company s costs 
pge has an aging workforce with a significant number of employees approaching retirement age 
the company anticipates higher averages of retirement rates over the next ten years and will likely need to replace a significant number of employees in key positions 
pge s ability to successfully implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon the company s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers 
without a skilled workforce  the company would face greater challenges in providing quality service to its customers and meeting regulatory requirements  both of which could affect operating results 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with the renewal of hydroelectric licenses could require large capital expenditures 
pge is currently involved in renewing the federal license for its hydroelectric projects on the clackamas river 
the ferc  under the federal power act  may impose conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters in connection with the renewal of pge s license 
the company cannot predict with certainty the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process  the economic impact of those requirements  whether a new license will ultimately be issued or whether pge will be willing to meet the relicensing requirements to continue operating its clackamas hydroelectric projects 
the company would likely seek recovery of any additional costs related to such licensing requirements through the ratemaking process

all jurisdictional sellers of energy and or capacity at wholesale into electric energy and or capacity markets in the pacific northwest  including parties to the western system power pool agreement  federal energy regulatory commission  docket nos 
el  et seq  and ninth circuit court of appeals  case no 
collectively  pacific northwest refund proceeding 
on july   the ferc called for a preliminary evidentiary hearing to explore whether there may have been unjust and unreasonable charges for spot market sales of electricity in the pacific northwest from december  through june  during that period  pge both sold and purchased electricity in the pacific northwest 
in september  upon completion of hearings  the appointed administrative law judge issued a recommended order that the claims for refunds be dismissed 
in december  the ferc re opened the case to allow parties to conduct further discovery 
in june  the ferc issued an order terminating the proceeding and denying the claims for refunds 
in november and february  the ferc denied all requests for rehearing of its june decision 
parties appealed various aspects of these ferc orders to the us ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit 
on august   the ninth circuit issued its decision on appeal  concluding that the ferc failed to adequately explain how it considered or examined new evidence showing intentional market manipulation in california and its potential ties to the pacific northwest and that the ferc should not have excluded from the pacific northwest refund proceeding purchases of energy made by the california energy resources scheduling cers division in the pacific northwest spot market 
the ninth circuit remanded the case to the ferc to i address the new market manipulation evidence in detail and account for it in any future orders regarding the award or denial of refunds in the proceedings  ii include sales to cers in its analysis  and iii further consider its refund decision in light of related  intervening opinions of the court 
the ninth circuit offered no opinion on the ferc s findings based on the record established by the administrative law judge and did not rule on the ferc s ultimate decision to deny refunds 
two requests for rehearing were filed with the court and on april   the ninth circuit issued an order that denied the requests for rehearing 
on april   the ninth circuit issued a mandate giving immediate effect to its august  order remanding the case to the ferc 
since issuance of the mandate  certain parties proposing refunds have filed pleadings with ferc suggesting procedures on remand  attempting to initiate new proceedings  and containing additional evidence that they assert shows market wide manipulation that justifies refunds from early in parties opposing refunds  including pge  have filed various pleadings that contest allegations of market wide manipulation and urge the ferc to reaffirm  with a more detailed explanation of its consideration of market manipulation claims  its previous decision not to initiate proceedings to order refunds 
on september   various parties  including pge  filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the us supreme court requesting that the supreme court review the decision of the ninth circuit in the pacific northwest refund proceeding 
in january  the supreme court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari 
on may   the ferc approved a settlement between pge and certain parties in the california refund case in docket no 
el  et seq 
this resolves the claims as between pge and the california parties named in the settlement as to transactions in the pacific northwest during the settlement period  january  through june  the settlement with the california parties does not resolve potential claims from other market participants relating to transactions in the pacific northwest 
management cannot predict the outcome of the pacific northwest refund proceeding  or whether the ferc will order refunds in the pacific northwest  and if so  how such refunds would be calculated 
management believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of the company  but may have a material adverse impact on pge s results of operations and cash flows in a future reporting period
