general we are in a highly stratified industry with the top five producers accounting for percent of poultry production in this country and the next fifteen accounting for percent 
our company currently produces ready to cook product of million pounds per week  placing it as the twenty second integrated broiler company ranked by ready to cook pounds 
cagle s produces a product which differentiates itself from the average broiler company  as industry live weights average pounds per head  and our birds weigh approximately pounds per head 
while this difference impacts the fixed cost per unit of our operations  we believe it serves our company by allowing us to compete for a value added customer profile namely the fast food  institutional  and deli markets 
we believe this is a market segment that we excel in and can provide our customers with distinctive  q uality product to fit their needs at margins necessary to offset the higher cost per unit brought about by the smaller live weight 
the company has begun to transition its pine mountain valley processing facility to a deboning operation where of the breast will be boned with the remaining portion of the bird being packed for retail and or export 
this transition will be completed by the first of june and will result in an increase to the company s pounds processed and revenue of approximately 
live bird size at pine mountain valley after the transition is estimated to be pounds and capacity will be adjusted to  birds per hour 
for the fiscal year ending  the company reported net income of million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share for fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to million as compared to for fiscal poultry sales pounds for the year increased reflecting an increase in further processed  breaded products coupled with an average price per pound increase of when compared to fiscal head processed for the company were more in than fiscal market prices compared to fiscal for boneless breast  wings and tenders were up  and  respectively 
all year to year comparison dark meat prices were down  as boneless thigh  leg quarters and drums decreased  and  respectively 
as a company we continue to focus on niche markets where we can react to our customer needs in a quick and efficient manner 
given our bird size and production facilities we continue to exploit our expertise in the deli fast food are na

total debt of million reflected a decrease of or million this fiscal year 
as we begin fiscal we anticipate that economic conditions will continue to improve and the value and demand for poultry will increase providing positive margins for the remainder of this fiscal year 
it is our expectation that capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand and cash generated through operations

table of contents financial condition liquidity analysis of cash flows we expect that cash flow from operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund operations  to make all payments of principal and interest when due  and to fund capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations contractual obligations at april  were as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations td width valign bottom bgcolor cceeff style background cceeff  padding in in in in  width  other long term liabilities total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  o r changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect 
table of contents the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon product shipment and transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  allowances or promotions 
estimates for any special pricing arrangements  promotions or other volume based incentives are recorded upon shipment of the product in accordance with the terms of the promotion  allowance or pricing arrangements 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts reflecting estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
due to the nature of the industry and the short term nature of these accounts  there have not been material revisions in these estimates of management 
inventories live bird and hatching egg inventories are stated at cost and breeder hens are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  consistent with industry standards 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over a forty week period 
finished poultry products  feed  and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventories and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting the inventories obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  which are carried in inventories at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected at cost or market  whichever is lower 
for inventory valuation purposes costs include live production costs principally feed  chick cost  medications and other raw materials  labor and production overhead 
not all broilers and breeders survive to maturity or disposition  normal losses are not expensed directly because total costs of the project are assigned to the survivors 
the company would record adjustments to reduce the values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market values if market prices for poultry or feed grains moved substantially lower  this would increase our cost of sales 
the company has not experienced material revisions to its inventory costs 
property  plant and equipment the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations  and estimated salvage values  and ii estimated fair market value of the assets 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance insurance expense and liabilities for employee related health care benefits and casualty claims is estimated using historical experience  insurance and actuarial projections 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual liabilities and expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
related party transactions members of the cagle s family beneficially own  in the aggregate  of the company s outstanding common stock  giving them control of approximately of the total voting power of the company s outstanding voting stock 
in addition  three 
table of contents members of the cagle s family serve on the company s board 
as a result  members of the cagle s family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over management and affairs  and over substantially all matters requiring action by the stockholders  including amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws  the election and removal of directors  any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets  and other corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by other stockholders and could depress the stock price 
the firm of byrne  davis hicks  pc in which g 
bland byrne  iii  a director of the company  is a principal  received thousand  thousand and thousand during the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the payments received are for fees incurred for legal services rendered to the company and its subsidiaries 
included in other assets at april  and march  is a receivable of million due to the company from two related party irrevocable life insurance trusts 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
the company adopted asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective april  asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption or at april  accordingly  the company does not have any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
however  if interest or penalties were to be incurred related to uncertain tax positions  such amounts would be recognized in income tax expense 
tax periods for all years after remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which it is subject 
the company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of  the company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes through realization of these future tax benefits is dependent on the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period 
due to the significant amount of income that would be needed to fully utilize the credits available  the company has recorded a valuation allowance for a significant portion of the deferred tax asset associated with the tax credit carryforwards 
the company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and  accordingly  there is no valuation allowance associated with the net operating loss carryforwards 
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which established the fasb asc as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
pursuant to the provisions of fasb asc  the company has updated references to gaap in its consolidated financial statements issued for the period ended october  the adoption of fasb asc did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued new us gaap guidance that requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this guidance also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued new us gaap guidance clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value 
among other things  the guidance clarifies how the price of a traded debt security an asset value should be considered in estimating the fair value of the issuer s liability and is effective for the first reporting period beginning after its issuance 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new us gaap guidance that requires an entity to allocate revenue arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices the relative selling price method 
the guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation  in which the undelivered element is measured at 
table of contents its estimated selling price and the delivered element is measured as the residual of the arrangement consideration  and requires the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables 
the new guidance must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted through either prospective application for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  after the effective date or through retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken 
profitability in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken and feed ingredients  which are determined by supply and demand factors  which result in cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens  and deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating resul ts in the past 
we periodically seek  to the extent available  to enter into advance purchase commitments for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
the use of such instruments may not be successful 
leverage our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and expect to continue to have  an amount of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds  and fail ing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
the company had variable interest rate exposure on the revolving credit facility at april  the company s theoretical interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings at april   would be  with a one percentage point increase in average interest rates on the company s borrowings would increase future interest expense by thousand per month and a two percentage point increase would increase future interest expense by thousand per month 
the company determined these amounts based on million of variable rate borrowings at april   multiplied by and  respectively  and divided by twelve 
the company is currently not using any interest rate collars  hedges  or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
as a result  any increase in interest rates on the company s va riable rate borrowings would increase interest expense and reduce net income 
additional borrowings available despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future 
contamination of products if our products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
livestock and poultry disease outbreaks of livestock diseases  in general  and poultry disease  in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  to or from our suppliers  facilities  or customers  or require us 
table of contents to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation  and prospects 
insurance we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage  and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited  and potentially inadequate 
significant competition competition in the chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies could adversely affect our business 
government regulation regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken industry is subject to federal  state  and local governmental regulation  including health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations  and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future
