item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dupont fabros technology  inc the company was incorporated in march under the laws of the state of maryland and is headquartered in washington  dc dupont fabros technology  inc is the sole general partner of dupont fabros technology  lp operating partnership  and  as of december   owned approximately of the partnership interests in the operating partnership 
we are organized so as to qualify  and have elected to be taxed  as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
our common stock trades on the new york stock exchange  or nyse  under the symbol dft 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to the company  we  us and our mean dupont fabros technology  inc and its subsidiaries 
we currently own and operate seven data centers  six of which are located in northern virginia and one of which is located in suburban chicago  illinois 
five of our northern virginia facilities are leased  the first phase of our northern virginia data center facility known as acc  which opened in september  is leased as of december   and the first phase of our chicago facility known as ch  which opened in august  is leased as of december  we also own other development properties and parcels of land that we intend to develop into wholesale data centers in the future 
with this portfolio of operating and development properties  we believe that we are well positioned as a fully integrated wholesale data center provider  capable of developing  leasing  operating and managing our growing portfolio 
to conserve liquidity  we had previously suspended development of acc  our data center located in piscataway  new jersey  known as nj and our data center located in santa clara  california known as sc however  in december we secured million of new financing through our operating partnership s offering of million of senior unsecured notes due and our entry into a million term loan due secured by our acc property 
we are using a portion of these proceeds to develop the second phase of acc  which is pre leased as of december   and resume development of nj in the future  we intend to resume development of sc and develop additional data centers in santa clara  california  northern virginia  and in suburban chicago  illinois 
we rely on third party sources of capital to fund our development projects  and consequently  we will continue to seek additional financing for these projects in and beyond

includes estimated capitalization for construction and development  including closing costs  capitalized interest and capitalized operating carrying costs  as applicable  upon completion 
amount capitalized as of december  we derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our operating properties 
because we believe that critical load is the primary factor used by tenants in evaluating data center requirements  our rents are based primarily on the amount of power that we make available to our tenants  rather than the amount of space that they occupy 
in  we executed leases representing megawatts of critical load and  raised square feet of space 
each of our leases includes pass through provisions under which our tenants are required to pay for their pro rata share of most of our property level operating expenses commonly referred to as a triple net lease  such as real estate taxes and insurance 
in addition  under our triple net lease structure  our tenants pay for only the 
table of contents power they use and power that is used to cool their space 
we intend to continue to structure future leases as triple net leases 
our leases also provide us with a property management fee based on a percentage of property level operating expenses  other than charges for power used by tenants to run their servers and cool their space 
although our leases provide for annual escalation of rents  generally or a function of cpi  our revenue growth in the near term will result primarily from leasing vacant space in our acc and chi data center properties 
as of december   we had a vacancy rate at acc phase and a vacancy rate at ch our revenue will fluctuate based upon the speed with which we lease the vacant space in these properties and in our acc phase ii and nj development properties 
additionally  under our triple net leases  we receive expense reimbursement from tenants only on space that is leased 
vacant space results in portions of our operating expenses being unreimbursed  which in turn impacts net income negatively 
the amount of net rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on our ability to maintain the historical lease rates of currently leased space and to re lease space available from leases that expire or are terminated 
none of our existing leases are scheduled to expire in our operating properties are located in northern virginia and suburban chicago  illinois 
changes in the conditions of these markets will impact the overall performance of our operating properties 
the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments could be impacted by future economic or regional downturns in the markets in which we operate or downturns in the technology industry 
if these or other conditions cause a tenant to default on its payment or other obligations  we could elect to terminate the related lease 
we believe that most of our tenants will renew their leases and will continue to make their rental and other payments when due 
nevertheless  if we cannot attract replacement tenants on similar terms in a timely manner for any leases that are not renewed or are terminated  our rental income will be impacted adversely in future periods 
our taxable reit subsidiary trs  df technical services  llc  generates revenue by providing certain technical services to our tenants on a contract or purchase order basis  which we commonly refer to as a la carte services 
such services include the installation of circuits  racks  breakers and other tenant requested items 
our trs will generally charge our tenants for these services on a cost plus basis 
because the degree of utilization of our trs for these services varies from period to period depending on the needs of our tenants for technical services  we have limited ability to forecast future revenue from this source 
moreover  as a taxable corporation  our trs is subject to federal  state and local corporate taxes and is not required to distribute its income  if any  to us for purposes of making additional distributions to our stockholders 
because demand for its services is unpredictable  we anticipate that our trs may retain a significant amount of its revenue to fund future operations  and therefore we do not expect to receive distributions from our trs on a regular basis 
in the current economic environment  certain types of real estate are experiencing declines in value 
we do not believe that any of our properties have experienced a significant decline in value 
nevertheless  if this trend were to be experienced by any of our datacenters  we may have to write down the value of that datacenter  which would result in us recording a charge against earnings 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue 
operating revenue for the year ended december  was million 
this includes base rent of million  tenant recoveries of million  which includes our property management fee  and other revenue of million  primarily from a la carte projects for our tenants performed by our trs 
this compares to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was due primarily to the lease up of acc and  to a lesser degree  ch  the opening of acc in september and an increase in revenue from a la carte services provided to our tenants 
the increase of million was partially offset by a decrease of straight line rent of million  therefore  cash rents increased million year over year 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was 
table of contents primarily due to the following million of increased operating costs at acc as the property was fully operational in  million of increased ch property operating costs  million of depreciation and amortization resulting from a full year of depreciation and amortization of ch  which was still in development during the first seven months of  and the opening of acc in september  million increase in real estate taxes and insurance  million of increased general and administrative expenses primarily for compensation  million of other expenses for non recurring tenant projects  and million of expenses related the temporary suspension of development of nj and sc interest expense 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs  for the year ended december  was million compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  included in interest in is million for the write off of deferred financing costs for debt retired in as compared to none in total interest incurred for the year ended december  was million  of which million was capitalized as compared to million for the year ending december   of which million was capitalized 
the increase in total interest increased year over year was due to higher debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest capitalized decreased year over year as there was less development activity in versus loss on discontinuance of cash flow hedge 
on december   we completed a million debt offering and repaid and terminated a credit facility  as discussed further below 
in addition  the company paid million to terminate the related interest rate swap agreement 
in connection with the termination of the credit facility and swap agreement  the company determined that the forecasted transaction under this swap agreement was no longer probable as originally forecasted and therefore all amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss were recognized in the statement of operations  resulting in million being recorded as loss on the discontinuance of cash flow hedge 
there was no such loss in net income attributable to controlling interests 
net income attributable to controlling interests for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge  higher interest expense and the operating expenses at ch due to its opening in august  partially offset by the redemption of op units in  which were converted into shares of our common stock and resulted in a greater percentage of net income being allocated to controlling interests 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  since our formation on march  until the closing of our ipo on october   we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of our company 
prior to october   operating results are presented for our predecessor 
operating results for the acquired properties are only reflected for the period subsequent to august  for the periods after the ipo  operating results are presented for the company  which includes the predecessor  the acquired properties  acc  nj  sc and acc and the other formation transactions 
to facilitate a comparison of results of operations for and  we have combined in the discussion below the operating results for our predecessor for the period from january  to october  with the operating results for the company for the period from october  to december  nonetheless  management believes that a year over year comparison may be of limited usefulness due to significant differences in the composition of our portfolio over such time 
in addition  the comparison may be of limited value because  prior to our ipo  our predecessor paid management and asset management fees to affiliates of our sponsors

liquidity and capital resources discussion of cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to additional operating cash generated by the lease up of acc in  an increase in cash based rents and an increase in prepaid rents and other liabilities

this development not only requires us to make substantial capital investments  but also increases our operating expenses  which impacts our cash flows from operations negatively until leases are executed and we begin to realize revenue 
in addition  because we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders annually 
we generally fund the cost of data center development from additional capital  which  for future developments  we would expect to obtain through unsecured and secured borrowings  construction financings and the issuance of additional equity securities  when market conditions permit 
during  we funded a portion of our development costs with cash provided by operating activities 
any increases in project development costs including the cost of labor and materials and costs resulting from construction delays  and rising interest rates would increase the funds necessary to complete a project and  in turn  the amount of additional capital that we would need to raise 
in determining the source of capital to meet our long term liquidity needs  we will evaluate our level of indebtedness and leverage ratio  our expected cash flow from operations  the state of the capital markets  interest rates and other terms for borrowing  and the relative timing considerations and costs of borrowing or issuing equity securities 
to conserve liquidity  in the fourth quarter of  we announced the temporary suspension of three projects under development  phase i of each of acc  nj and sc this decision related to the extremely difficult credit markets at the time  and because funding from a term loan secured by acc described below was less than anticipated 
however  in the first quarter of  we obtained additional financing and restarted development at acc  and we placed phase i in service in september further  in the fourth quarter of  we obtained million of new debt financing  and with the net proceeds of approximately million  we paid off approximately million of existing debt eliminating all maturities until  assuming we elect to extend the acc term loan which such extension is subject to customary conditions 
the excess funds were temporarily invested in marketable securities 
in addition  we expect to use approximately million to complete acc phase ii and million to complete nj phase i  each with an expected completion dates of the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we currently estimate dividends of approximately to per share to meet our reit distribution requirement 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on our receipt of distributions from our operating partnership  which in turn is dependent on our data center properties generating operating income 
the indenture that governs our unsecured notes limits our ability to pay dividends  but allows us to pay the minimum necessary to meet our reit income distribution requirements

off balance sheet arrangements as december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we describe below those accounting policies that we deem critical and require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which commences when control of the space and the critical power have been provided to the tenant 
deferred rent included in our consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that will be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases 
our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion 
table of contents of property operating expenses incurred by us 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue and of below market leases as an increase to rental revenue 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned  including a determination of the lease commencement date for accounting purposes  the existence of lease inducements and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
we analyze individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
capitalization of costs 
we capitalize direct and indirect costs related to construction and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
in addition  the company ceases cost capitalization after a development is placed in service and a certificate of occupancy is obtained  or if a project is temporarily suspended 
we capitalize pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions 
the selection of costs to capitalize and the determination of whether a proposed acquisition is probable are subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
variations in these assumptions would yield different amounts of capitalized costs in the periods presented 
all capital improvements for the income producing properties that extend the property s useful life are capitalized 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the major components of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
we currently depreciate the company s building and building improvements over years  and the electrical and mechanical components of a building over to years 
asset impairment evaluation 
we review the carrying value of our net real estate on a quarterly and annual basis 
we base our review on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property  which would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
one of our key assumptions in the analysis is that we will complete acc and phase i of sc  which is temporarily suspended as of the date of this filing 
since cash flows from properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions dictate an earlier sale date or if we determine that development of a project is no longer viable  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
we estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb relating to business combinations 
this guidance eliminates the step acquisition model  changes the recognition of contingent consideration from being recognized when it is probable to being recognized at the time of acquisition  disallows the capitalization of transaction costs and delays when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized 
also  this guidance addresses initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the adoption of this guidance will impact the accounting only for acquisitions occurring prospectively 
on january   the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb relating to derivatives and hedging that requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under the authoritative guidance  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial positions  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of this guidance see note 
on january   the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under this guidance  the fasb concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and  accordingly  are considered participating securities that shall be included in the two class method of computing basic and diluted eps 
the guidance does not address awards that contain rights to forfeitable dividends 
the impact of the adoption of this guidance on earnings per share was less than per share for the periods presented 
on april   the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased  as well as guidance in identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on april   the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this guidance requires an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information and requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
under this guidance  a publicly traded company shall include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods 
in addition  an entity shall disclose in the body or in the accompanying notes of its summarized financial information for interim reporting periods and in its financial statements for annual reporting periods the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position  as required by this guidance 
the resulting disclosure from the adoption of this guidance is in note during the second quarter of  the company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb relating to subsequent events 
this guidance provides authoritative accounting literature that was previously 
table of contents addressed only in the auditing literature 
the objective of this guidance is to establish principles and requirements for subsequent events 
in particular  this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative accounting guidance which established the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities and stated that all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the authoritative accounting guidance recognized that rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the company adopted the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for the interim reporting period ended september   the adoption of which did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
funds from operations the company the predecessor year ended december  october  ipo to december  january  to october  net loss income depreciation and amortization less non real estate depreciation and amortization ffo funds from operations  or ffo  is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we use ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
we also believe that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to our ffo 
therefore  we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an 
table of contents alternative to net income loss or to cash flow from operating activities each as computed in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
related party transactions leasing arrangements as of december   the company leased approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc  an office building owned by an entity controlled by our executive chairman and our president and chief executive officer 
for the year ended december   we paid million under the lease 
we believe that the terms of this lease are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms that we would expect to obtain in an arm s length transaction for comparable space elsewhere in washington  dc aircraft charter from time to time during  we chartered an aircraft owned by our executive chairman and our president and chief executive officer for business related travel 
for the year end december   we paid a total of million under these charters 
we believe that the rates paid for these charters are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms that we would expect to obtain in an arm s length transaction for use of a comparable aircraft 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we occasionally use derivatives to manage interest rate risk  but we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and  to the extent we elect to enter into hedging arrangements under the terms of our loan agreement  we intend to enter into contracts with financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december  would decrease future net income and cash flows by approximately million annually less the impact of capitalization of interest incurred on our net income 
because one month libor was approximately at december   a decrease of would result in a decrease in future net income and cash flows of approximately million annually less the impact of capitalization 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
