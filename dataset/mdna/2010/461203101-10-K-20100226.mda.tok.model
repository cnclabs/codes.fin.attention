goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
under intangibles goodwill and other  asc  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
the discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company s annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates 
i 
table of contents the company utilizes a discounted cash flow method model to analyze reporting units for impairment in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth  profitability  inventory turns  days sales outstanding  etc 
to forecast future cash flows 
the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the year treasury rate for the risk free rate  a market risk premium  the industry average beta  a small cap stock adjustment and company specific risk premiums 
the assumptions used are based on a market participant s point of view and yielded a discount rate of in compared to to in and to in if the discount rate used were basis points higher for the impairment analysis  the company could potentially have an impairment for the asia pacific reporting unit 
accordingly  the performance of the asia pacific region in particular will be closely monitored going forward to determine if the goodwill for the region needs to be re evaluated for potential impairment 
based upon the assumptions indicated above  there was no indication of impairment in related to goodwill impairment 
however  charges totaling  were recognized related to intangibles in europe and na hme and a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company s reporting units should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis 
furthermore  the company s annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly 
for instance  higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus  increase the chance of impairment 
product liability the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance co  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring up to  in annual aggregate losses arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits  as applicable

product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
warranty generally  the company s products are covered from the date of sale to the customer by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product 
certain components carry a lifetime warranty

table of contents adjustments as needed 
historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves 
claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed

as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock based compensation arrangements granted under the plans  which is related to non vested shares  and includes  related to restricted stock awards 
the company expects the compensation expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years

income taxes as part of the process of preparing its financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating the company s current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies

the fasb believed this clarification was needed because the accounting that was being applied for convertible debt prior to fsp apb did not fully reflect the true economic impact on the issuer since the conversion option was not captured as a borrowing cost and its full dilutive effect was not included in earnings per share 
asc required separate accounting for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt in a manner that would reflect invacare s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
accordingly  the company split the total debt amount of  into a convertible debt amount of  and a stockholders equity debt discount amount of  as of the retrospective adoption date of february  and is accreting the resulting debt discount as interest expense over a year life 
the adoption of fsp apb  effective january   resulted in retrospective application and accordingly reported interest expense was increased and net earnings decreased by  per share and  per share for and  respectively 
also as a result of the adoption of fsp apb  the consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects a decrease in long term debt and an offsetting increase in paid in capital of  and a deferred tax liability of  offset by a valuation reserve of the same amount 
in may  subsequent events  asc  was issued that provides authoritative guidance regarding subsequent events as this guidance was previously only addressed in auditing literature 
the company adopted asc effective june  and the adoption had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on july   the fasb issued asc  the accounting standards codification codification is the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  with the exception of guidance issued by the sec 
although the codification is not intended to change us gaap  it does reorganize and supersede current us gaap and therefore all references to us gaap in the company s filings were changed to codification references  beginning with the company s third quarter form q 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company does at times use interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on december  debt levels  a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately  additionally  the company operates internationally and  as a result  is i 
table of contents exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
specifically  the exposure results from intercompany loans and third party sales or payments 
in an attempt to reduce this exposure  foreign currency forward contracts are utilized 
the company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s current financing agreements  established in february  provided the company with total capacity of approximately  the  revolving credit facility has the earliest expiration date  which is february accordingly  the company s exposure to the volatility of the current market environment is limited as the company does not currently need to re finance any of its debt 
however  the company s borrowing arrangements contain covenants with respect to  among other items  maximum amount of debt  minimum loan commitments  interest coverage  dividend payments  working capital  and debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the company s bank agreements and agreement with its note holders 
the company is in compliance with all covenant requirements  but should it fall out of compliance with these requirements  the company would have to attempt to obtain financing in the current market environment and thus likely be required to pay much higher interest rates
