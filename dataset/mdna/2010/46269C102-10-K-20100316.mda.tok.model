background and recent events we were formed as ghl acquisition corp  a special purpose acquisition company  on november   for the purpose of effecting a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase  reorganization or other similar business 
table of contents combination 
we closed an initial public offering of our common stock on february  all of our activity from november  inception through february  related to our formation and initial public offering 
from february  through september   our activities were limited to identifying prospective target businesses to acquire and complete a business combination  and we were considered to be in the development stage 
on september   we acquired  directly and indirectly  all the outstanding equity of iridium holdings llc  or iridium holdings 
we refer to this transaction as the acquisition 
iridium holdings and its two principal subsidiaries  iridium satellite llc  or iridium satellite  and iridium constellation llc  or iridium constellation  were formed under the laws of delaware in and were organized as limited liability companies pursuant to the delaware limited liability company act 
we refer to iridium holdings  together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries  as iridium 
on december   iridium acquired satellite communication assets from iridium llc  a non affiliated debtor in possession  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
iridium and its affiliates held  and following the acquisition we hold  various licenses and authorizations from the fcc and from international regulatory bodies that permit us to conduct our business  including the operation of our satellite constellation 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  we purchased all of the outstanding equity of iridium holdings 
total consideration included million shares of our common stock and million in cash  which included a requirement to make a payment of million in cash to some of the former members of iridium holdings for tax benefits we received 
this requirement was satisfied with payments subsequently made in december and january upon closing of the acquisition  we changed our name from ghl acquisition corp 
to iridium communications inc we accounted for our business combination with iridium holdings as a purchase business combination and recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values pursuant to accounting guidance that was effective at the time 
pursuant to this guidance  we were deemed the legal and accounting acquirer and iridium holdings the legal and accounting acquiree 
iridium is considered our predecessor and  accordingly  its historical financial statements are deemed to be our predecessor financial statements 
iridium s historical financial statements are included in this form k but are presented separately from our financial statements 
for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   we determined that the results of iridium s operations for the one day period from the closing of the acquisition to september  were not material 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  include the results of our pre acquisition operations for the nine months ended september  and our post acquisition operations for the three months ended december  all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
overview following the acquisition  we are now engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites 
we are the second largest provider of satellite based mobile voice and data communications services  and the only provider of mobile satellite communications services offering global coverage 
our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where existing wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are impaired  including extremely remote or rural land areas  airways  open ocean  the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters 
we offer voice and data communications services to businesses  the us and foreign governments  non governmental organizations and consumers using our constellation of in orbit satellites and related ground infrastructure  including a primary commercial gateway 
we utilize an interlinked  mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks 
this unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation  which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence 
we sell our products and services to commercial end users exclusively through a wholesale distribution network  encompassing approximately service providers  value added resellers  or vars  and value added manufacturers  who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers  vars or dealers 
these distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific vertical markets 
at december   we had approximately  subscribers worldwide were machine to machine  or mm  data subscribers who elected to suspend their accounts and as a result were not generating any fees at such time  which represented a increase over december  we have a diverse customer base  including end users in the following vertical markets land based handset  maritime  aviation  mm  and government 

table of contents we expect our future revenue growth rates will be slower than our historical growth rates and we expect future growth will be affected by the current economic slowdown  increased competition  gradual maturation of the satellite communications industry and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates as we increase in size 
our business plan calls for the development of iridium next  the development of new product and service offerings  upgrades to our current services  hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems 
we estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related infrastructure upgrades will be approximately billion although we have not yet entered into definitive agreements for these activities and our actual cost could substantially exceed this estimate 
we expect to fund a substantial portion of these costs from internally generated cash flows  including revenues from secondary payloads and warrant proceeds 
we expect to finance the remaining cost by raising additional debt or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows will meet our expectations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient external capital to fund iridium next and implement other elements of our business plan  due to increased costs  lower revenues or inability to obtain additional financing 
among other factors leading to this uncertainty  some of the warrants whose proceeds we expect to use to fund a portion of iridium next are currently under water  meaning they have an exercise price per share that is significantly higher than the current price at which our common stock is trading 
in addition  none of the warrants are callable by us until such time as our stock trades at a per share price greater than for our warrants or for our warrants for an extended period of time 
as of march   the closing price of our common stock was per share 
unless our stock price increases significantly  we would not expect the under water warrants to be exercised and we will not be able to call any of the warrants 
if we do not obtain such funds from internally generated cash flows  or from the net proceeds of future debt or equity financings  our ability to maintain our network  design  build and launch iridium next and related ground infrastructure  products and services  and pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired 
the recent global economic crisis and related tightening of credit markets has also made it more difficult and expensive to raise capital 
our ability to obtain additional capital to finance iridium next and related ground infrastructure  products and services  and other capital requirements may be adversely impacted by the continuation of these market conditions 
we have engaged goldman  sachs co 
as our lead global advisor to help secure the funding necessary to design  build and launch iridium next  although we cannot assure you that we will have access to sources of financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fully implement our business plan as currently projected  if at all  which would significantly limit the development of our business and impair our ability to provide a commercially acceptable level of service 
the impact of adding the fair value of iridium s assets and liabilities to our balance sheet has resulted in a significant increase in the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
because we estimated the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities  we may revise those estimates through a measurement period ending september   the first anniversary of the acquisition  if better information becomes available to us 
when comparing our results of operations to that of our predecessor  iridium  the impact of the acquisition accounting on the carrying value of inventory  property and equipment  intangible assets and accruals  increased by approximately million  million  million and million  respectively compared to iridium s balance sheet as of september  similarly  iridium s deferred revenue decreased by million 
as a result of accounting adjustments related to the acquisition  our cost of subscriber equipment sales will increase in as compared to those costs and expenses of iridium in prior periods and the decrease in the carrying value of deferred revenue will result in a decrease in revenue in in addition  the increase in accruals will result in a reduction in cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization during and future periods 
the increase in property and equipment and intangible assets will result in an increase to depreciation and amortization expense during and future periods 
material trends and uncertainties iridium s industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services  increased demand for communications services by the department of defense  or dod  disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  a broad and expanding wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets  a growing number of new products and services and related applications  
table of contents improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings  regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services  particularly among maritime end users  a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services equipment  and geographic market expansion through the receipt of licenses in additional countries 
nonetheless  as we continue the iridium business  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties  including our ability to obtain capital and external funding to meet our future capital requirements on acceptable terms or at all  including  in particular  the funding for developing iridium next and related ground infrastructure  products and services  our ability to maintain the health  capacity  control and level of service of our satellite network during transition to iridium next  changes in general economic  business and industry conditions  our reliance on a single primary gateway and a primary satellite network operations center  the competition from other mobile satellite service providers and  to a lesser extent  from the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures  our ability to maintain our relationship with us government customers  particularly the dod  rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry  reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products  services and applications effectively  and our ability to successfully resolve a dispute with motorola  inc  or motorola  regarding fees they have alleged that we owe to them and to license the required intellectual property for iridium next 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and those of iridium  as our predecessor  is based upon our consolidated financial statements and those of iridium  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  useful lives of property and equipment  long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation and other estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and those of iridium  as our predecessor  and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements and those of iridium for a full discussion of these significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition iridium derived  and we now derive  our revenue primarily as a wholesaler of satellite communications products and services 
the primary types of revenue include i services revenue access and usage based airtime fees and ii subscriber equipment revenue 
additionally  we generate revenue by providing engineering and support services to commercial and government customers 

table of contents wholesaler of satellite communications products and services pursuant to wholesale agreements  we sell products and services to service providers who  in turn  sell the products and services to other distributors or directly to the end users 
generally  we recognize revenue when services are performed or delivery has occurred  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable  as follows contracts with multiple elements at times  we sell subscriber equipment through multi element contracts that bundle subscriber equipment with airtime services 
when we sell subscriber equipment and airtime services in bundled arrangements that include guaranteed minimum orders and we determine that we have separate units of accounting  we allocate the bundled contract price among the various contract deliverables based on each deliverable s relative fair value 
we determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value by assessing sales prices of subscriber equipment and airtime services when they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
services revenue sold on a stand alone basis we generate services revenue from our service providers through usage of our satellite system and through fixed monthly access fees per user charged to service providers 
we recognize revenue for usage when the usage occurs 
we recognize revenue for fixed per user access fees ratably over the period in which the services are provided to the end user 
we recognize revenue from prepaid services when usage occurs or  if not used  when the customer s right to access the unused prepaid services expires 
we do not offer refund privileges for unused prepaid services 
deferred prepaid services revenue and access fees are typically earned and recognized as income within one year of customer prepayment 
based on historical information for prepaid scratch card services that do not have an initial expiration date  we record breakage associated with prepaid scratch card account balances for which the likelihood of redemption is remote  which is generally determined after months from issuance 
subscriber equipment sold on a stand alone basis we recognize subscriber equipment sales and the related costs when title to the equipment and the risks and rewards of ownership passes to the customer  typically upon shipment 
services and subscriber equipment sold to the us government we provide airtime to us government subscribers through i fixed monthly fees on a per user basis for unlimited voice services  ii fixed monthly fees per user for unlimited paging services and iii a tiered pricing plan based on usage per device  for data services 
we recognize revenue related to these services ratably over the periods in which the services are provided and we expense the related costs as incurred 
the us government purchases its equipment from third party service providers and not directly from us 
government engineering and support services we provide maintenance services to the us government s dedicated gateway in hawaii 
we recognize this revenue ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
we expense costs as incurred 
other government and commercial engineering and support services we also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies for use on our satellite system 
we recognize the revenue associated with these services when the services are rendered  typically on a percentage of completion method of accounting based on our estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract  and we expense related costs as incurred 
we recognize revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts to the extent of estimated costs incurred plus the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fixed fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation at fair value  accordingly  we expense the estimated fair value of stock based awards made in exchange for employee services over the requisite employee service period 
we determine stock based compensation cost at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest as expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period and that expense is classified in the statement of operations in a manner consistent with the statement of operations classification of the employee s salaries and other compensation 

table of contents business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair value 
we expense all acquisition related costs as incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
recoverability of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present 
we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
any impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the assets carrying amount over their fair value 
fair value is based on market prices where available  an estimate of market value or various valuation techniques 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we perform impairment testing for goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
if the fair value of goodwill were to be less than the carrying amount of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss 
intangible assets not subject to amortization a significant portion of our intangible assets are our spectrum and licenses  and trade names which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
we reevaluate the useful life determination for these assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized 
intangible assets subject to amortization we amortize our intangible assets that do have finite lives  which consist of primarily customer relationships  both government and commercial  core developed technology and software  over their useful lives and we review them for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if any indicators were present  we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset 
if those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount  that is  if the asset is not recoverable  we would perform the next step  which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss  if any 
we reevaluate the useful lives for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives 
stock purchase warrants we account for stock purchase warrants as equity securities unless  based on the underlying terms of the stock warrant purchase agreement  the warrants are determined to be derivative instruments 
at december   all outstanding warrants were classified within stockholders equity 
comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and for the periods prior to the acquisition  we did not engage in any significant operations or generate any revenues from operations 
for the year ended december   we had million of revenue  which is entirely attributable to the three months of operations after the acquisition 
we expect revenue to increase significantly in as we will have a full year of operations 
see comparison of combined results of operations for additional analysis 

table of contents total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to the three months of operations after the acquisition and an increase in transaction costs primarily due to legal and advisory fees associated with the acquisition 
other expense changed to million in the year ended december  from million of other income in the year ended december  this change was primarily due to our determination that the exchange agreements entered into with the holders of million warrants were derivative instruments and the change in fair value of these warrants was million  along with a decrease in other income as a result of lower prevailing interest rates available on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
we had an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  in  we had current tax expenses primarily driven by the non deductibility of the change in fair value of warrants and non deductible transaction costs offset by a favorable change in the deferred tax balances due to the change in basis as a result of the acquisition 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the equivalent period in due to the non deductibility of certain transaction costs and the change in fair value for the derivative instruments associated with the warrant exchange and repurchase agreements 
we do not expect the effective tax rate to continue at this level as the non deductible items related to the warrant exchange agreements and the transaction costs are not expected to have a future impact 
comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  and the period from november  inception to december  net income for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of approximately  for the period from november  inception to december  operations in were limited to minimal administrative costs  compared to  which consisted of approximately million of interest income primarily from the trust account offset by approximately million of transaction fees related to due diligence work incurred in conjunction with our proposed business combination  as well as selling  general and administrative expenses of million and a provision for income taxes of approximately million 
comparison of combined results of operations for the year ended december  and iridium s results of operations for the year ended december  for comparison purposes  we have included the following discussion of our operating results and those of iridium on a combined basis for the year ended december  this presentation is intended to facilitate the evaluation and understanding of the financial performance of our business on a year to year basis 
management believes this presentation is useful in providing the users of our financial information with an understanding of our results of operations because there were no material changes to the operations or customer relationships of iridium as a result of the acquisition 
the combined presentation is a simple mathematical addition of the pre acquisition results of operations of iridium for the period from january  to september  and our results of operations for the year ended december  we had no material operating activities from the date of formation of ghl acquisition corp 
until the acquisition 
accordingly  we are comparing the combined results to iridium s results of operations for the year ended december  there are no other adjustments made in the combined presentation

total subscribers increased by approximately during the year ended december  to approximately  compared to an increase of approximately during the year ended december  subscriber growth slowed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the economic environment 
government services revenue government services revenue increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of an overall increase in work performed under engineering and support services contracts in in addition  voice services revenue increased primarily due to the full year impact of price increases implemented in april  and an increase in mm data revenue driven primarily by subscriber growth 
the number of voice subscribers remained constant from to  because the increase in handset subscribers was offset by a decrease in paging subscribers and voice average revenue per unit  or arpu  increased by to in from in primarily due to an increase in the monthly access fee 
mm data arpu increased by to in from in primarily due to a mix change in our tiered pricing data plans 
we expect government revenue to be slightly lower in as compared to as engineering and support services contract work is expected to decrease in as work curtails 
also  future growth in voice and mm data subscribers and revenue may be negatively affected by changes in us defense spending and usage under our agreement with the us government  which accounts for a majority of our government services revenue and is subject to annual renewals 
government services combined year ended december  iridium year ended december  year over year change revenue in millions and subscribers in thousands revenue subscribers arpu revenue subscribers arpu revenue subscribers arpu voice mm data engineering and support total subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period 
arpu is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period 

table of contents commercial services revenue commercial services revenue increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due principally to growth in commercial voice service subscribers and a increase per user in monthly access fees in january mm data revenue growth was driven principally by evolving applications developed by several of our distributors  and an increase in the subscriber base slightly offset by a decline in usage related to the expiration of a special customer promotion in mm data arpu decreased by to in from in  primarily due to an increase in our suspended accounts in  which did not have corresponding revenue 
in addition  we have a significant number of active mm data subscribers who subscribe through a var who is currently substantially behind on payment 
if we choose to terminate our relationship with this var for non payment  there is no guarantee that these end user subscribers  with whom we do not have a direct relationship  will migrate to another of our service providers or vars to purchase our products and services 
although we do not expect that such a termination would have a material impact on our financial results of operations  it would dramatically decrease our subscriber growth rate 
commercial services combined year ended december  iridium year ended december  year over year change revenue in millions and subscribers in thousands revenue subscribers arpu revenue subscribers arpu revenue subscribers arpu voice mm data other total subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period 
arpu is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
subscribers at december  and subscribers at december  were mm data subscribers who elected to suspend their accounts and as a result were not generating any fees at such time 
subscriber equipment revenue subscriber equipment sales decreased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  decreased subscriber equipment sales were primarily due to lower volumes driven largely by reduced demand for satellite equipment caused by the current economic downturn and customer defections from a competitor in in addition  we have decreased unit prices in response to competitive pressures and also to incent future growth in services revenue 
equipment volume could continue to be affected by increased competitive pressure and the economy in the near term 
subscriber equipment sales to the us government through a non government distributor may be negatively affected by significant changes in us defense spending and usage under our agreements with the us government  which are subject to annual renewals 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased depreciation and amortization  increased cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization and increased transaction costs incurred to complete the acquisition  offset by lower cost of subscriber equipment due to a decrease in sales and lower research and development expenses 

table of contents cost of subscriber equipment sales cost of subscriber equipment sales generally includes the direct costs of equipment sold which are manufacturing costs  allocation of overhead  warranty costs and royalties paid for the subscriber equipment intellectual property 
cost of subscriber equipment sales decreased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to a decrease in sales of subscriber equipment and lower manufacturing costs  partially offset by an million increase related to higher inventory values due to the acquisition 
equipment volume could continue to be impacted by increased competitive pressure and the economy in the near term or changes in us defense spending 
cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization generally includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff and subcontractors  software maintenance  product support services and cost of services for government engineering and support revenue 
cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased engineering and support services related to government revenues  along with increased operations and maintenance expenses from annual price escalations in the long term operations and maintenance agreement  or the o m agreement  between iridium constellation and the boeing company  or boeing 
we expect cost of services to slightly decrease in as our level of effort under government engineering and support services contracts decreases as work curtails 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of a significant decrease in expenses related to our l band transceiver project and iridium next  and reduced spending on iridium openport  the development of which was completed in these decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses related to government handset upgrade projects and future gateway upgrade projects 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase to depreciation and amortization due to increased asset values related to acquisition accounting  and additional depreciation associated with new assets placed in service  primarily equipment and software for our satellite network operations center  gateway and corporate systems 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense in to continue to be at levels significantly higher than in primarily due to higher asset values as a result of the acquisition 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses generally include sales and marketing costs as well as legal  finance  information technology  facilities  billing and customer care expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to accelerated vesting of employee share based awards as a result of the acquisition  an increase in bad debt expense  higher licensing and regulatory fees  and non acquisition legal fees  partially offset by decrease in travel expenses and consulting fees 
transaction costs transaction costs related to the acquisition increased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased legal  accounting  and advisory fees for iridium prior to the acquisition 

table of contents other expense income change in fair value of warrants change in fair value of warrants was million for the year ended december  on a combined basis and was for the year ended december  we determined that the exchange agreements entered into with the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock were derivative instruments and the change in fair value of these warrants between the offer date and exchange date was recorded in we do not expect a change in future periods as these agreements have been settled 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest interest expense decreased by to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from lower prevailing interest rates on the credit facilities and a lower outstanding balance on iridium s debt as mandatory prepayments on the credit facilities were made in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of pursuant to the amendment of the credit facilities agreement  which was paid off on september  if we are successful in obtaining third party debt financing to support a portion of our development of iridium next  our interest expense in could be significantly higher than in interest income and other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net increased by million to million on a combined basis for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a reduction in the impact of foreign currency exchange transaction costs 
income tax benefit prior to the completion of the acquisition  iridium was a limited liability company treated as a partnership for income tax purposes  therefore  the members were subject to income taxation and iridium did not have any income tax benefit or provision for the period from january  to september  and for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had an income tax benefit of million 
in  we had current tax expenses primarily driven by the non deductibility of the change in the fair value of warrants and non deductible transaction costs offset by a favorable change in the deferred tax balances due to the change in basis as a result of the acquisition 
comparison of iridium s results of operations for the years ended december  and for comparison purposes  we have included a discussion of the operating results of iridium the predecessor entity for the years ended december  and management believes this presentation facilitates the evaluation and understanding of the results of iridium s operations since our company conducted no material operating activities from the date of its formation as ghl acquisition corp 
until the acquisition 
revenue total revenue increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due principally to growth in total subscribers  increased commercial services revenue  increased subscriber equipment sales and increased contract revenue from the dod as well as the renewal of its service agreements with the us government and related fee increases 
total subscribers increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  government services revenue government services revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this growth was driven primarily by an increase in engineering and support services revenue relating to several research and development agreements with the igps contract and other us government agencies  including secondary payload research studies 
the remaining growth was attributable to a increase in user fees and higher gateway maintenance revenue as provided in iridium s agreements with the us government  which became effective april

subscriber equipment sales subscriber equipment sales increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  increased subscriber equipment sales were driven principally by subscriber growth and the related increase in sales of iridium s satellite handsets and iridium data modem 
although the proportion of satellite handset sales relative to sales of iridium s other lower priced devices decreased during the period  sales of iridium s higher priced handsets grew in absolute terms  contributing significantly to growth in its revenue from subscriber equipment sales 
until the introduction of its iridium openport terminals  iridium s satellite handsets had been its highest priced devices 

table of contents operating expenses total operating expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased costs of sales resulting from a growth in sales of iridium s voice and data devices as well as increased research and development expenses related to the development of new subscriber equipment and services and iridium next 
total operating expenses for the period also increased as a result of higher selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from increased personnel expenses from growth in total employees resulting from its expansion and higher transaction costs as iridium worked towards completing the acquisition 
cost of subscriber equipment sales cost of subscriber equipment sales increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of subscriber growth and the related increase in sales of iridium s voice and data devices  particularly its satellite handsets 
iridium s handsets have the highest production costs of all its devices  except for iridium openport 
this increase in costs of sales was offset by a decrease in the cost of recognizing previously deferred subscriber equipment sales of million  or approximately  to million for the period ended december   from million in effective january   equipment sales and related costs are recognized when equipment title passes to the customer 
cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased maintenance expenses with respect to iridium s satellite network due to the annual price escalation clause in the o m agreement  higher fees for software licensing and maintenance  increased expenses related to engineering and support services related to the igps contract  and an increase in variable network costs  including termination costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of additional depreciation associated with new equipment placed in service  including a new satellite earth station facility in norway and equipment for iridium s satellite network operations center and gateway 
research and development research and development expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased expenses related to investments in new subscriber equipment and services  including iridium s next generation satellite handset  l band transceiver and short burst data modem and iridium openport  as well as the development of iridium next 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher legal  regulatory and accounting expenses in resulting from iridium s increased personnel and other administrative expenses related to growth and pursuit of expansion opportunities 
transaction costs transaction costs were million for the year ended december  transaction costs primarily include legal  accounting and consulting fees 
there were no such costs for the year ended december  other expense income interest expense  net of capitalized interest interest expense decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from lower outstanding balances on iridium s first and second lien credit agreements 

table of contents interest income and other income expense  net interest and other income decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower interest income resulting from a decrease in the interest earned on iridium s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by increased foreign currency transaction losses 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and internally generated cash flow 
our principal liquidity requirements are to meet capital expenditure needs  including the development of iridium next  working capital  and research and development 
we believe that our sources of liquidity will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for  exclusive of requirements in connection with the continued development of iridium next 
we anticipate entering into contracts and making contractual commitments for the design  manufacturing and deployment of iridium next  which will require substantial capital in and thereafter 
prior to entering into commitments  we will need to secure financing 
we expect to fund a substantial portion of the costs associated with iridium next from internally generated cash flows  including potential revenues from secondary payloads hosted on our iridium next satellites  and from the proceeds generated from the exercise of outstanding stock purchase warrants 
however  a portion of the warrants whose proceeds we expect to use to fund a portion of iridium next are currently under water  meaning they have an exercise price per share that  for certain of our warrants  is significantly higher than the current price at which our common stock is trading 
in addition  none of the warrants are callable by us until such time as our stock trades at a per share price greater than for our warrants  or for our warrants  for an extended period of time 
as of march  the closing price of our common stock was per share 
unless our stock price increases significantly  we would not expect the under water warrants to be exercised and we will not be able to call any of the warrants 
if we do not obtain such funds from internally generated cash flows  or from the net proceeds of future debt or equity financings  our ability to maintain our network  design  build and launch iridium next and related ground infrastructure  products and services  and pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired 
if future internally generated cash flows and revenue from hosting secondary payloads are below expectations  the cost of developing iridium next is higher than anticipated or warrant proceeds are not realized  we will require even more external funding than planned 
since we have not yet entered into an agreement with a prime contractor for iridium next  the exact amount and timing of the payments to be owed under any such agreement is uncertain 
if the timing or amount of our payments under an agreement with our prime contractor are due sooner than expected or are larger than anticipated  we may not have sufficient liquidity to make those payments 
our ability to obtain additional funding for iridium next may be adversely impacted by a number of factors  including the global economic crisis and related tightening of the credit markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such additional liquidity on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure such financing  we would need to delay some or all of the elements of our iridium next development 
our liquidity and our ability to fund our liquidity requirements is also dependent on our future financial performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities iridium s net cash provided by operating activities for the period increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily attributable to less cash used by working capital due to the period not including activity for the three months ended december  as a result of the acquisition  lower inventory balances as demand slowed for equipment in the period and inventory management processes  partially offset by timing of payments to vendors 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to a million increase in net income  an million increase in working capital and a million increase in non cash adjustments during the period 
the increase in working capital primarily relates to a payment made to boeing in in connection with iridium s purchase of their right to receive distributions  which consequentially reduced its working capital for that period  as well as an increase in deferred revenue resulting from higher sales of its prepaid services and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to vendors 
the increase in non cash adjustments consists primarily of increases in depreciation and amortization and increases in other non cash amortization and accretion 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the period decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to lower capital costs related to equipment and software for iridium s satellite and network operations  gateway and corporate systems  which were placed in service in iridium s capital expenditures consisted primarily of the hardware and software upgrades to maintain its ground infrastructure and a portion of the expenses related to the development of iridium openport 
these also include upgrades to our billing system to enable customer billing of new products and services

certain amounts related to iridium next are not included as they are terminable or contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones  which may or may not be achieved 
as a result  the minimum commitment cannot be determined 

table of contents the table above reflects obligations due on december  to motorola pursuant to the transition services  products and asset agreement  or the tsa  by and among motorola  iridium holdings and iridium satellite  and our senior subordinated term loan agreement with motorola  or the note agreement  which may be accelerated if the acquisition constitutes a triggering event 
in addition  we may be required to make an additional payment of cash if the acquisition constitutes a triggering event  distribution event  change of control or other specified transaction under the tsa and note agreement 
any such payment is not reflected in the table above because it is uncertain whether we owe it or what the amount would be 
motorola has recently filed a complaint in illinois state court seeking payment of some of these payments 
for more information  see legal proceedings and risk factors our agreements with motorola contain potential payment provisions that may apply to the acquisition  and motorola has filed a complaint in illinois state court seeking to compel us to make those payments

accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting guidance on financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
the new guidance requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether the company s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
additionally  a company is required to assess whether it has implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures that provide more transparent information about a company s involvement with a variable interest entity 
the new guidance is effective for us beginning with we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  or asu asu amends existing accounting guidance for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific evidence is not available  or the estimated selling price if neither vendor specific evidence nor third party evidence is available 
asu eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
asu requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a stand alone basis 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of asu on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  or asu asu changes the accounting for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components  that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality  are no longer within the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
asu 
table of contents requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance  and provides guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product also would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu also requires that if software contained in the tangible product is essential to the tangible product s functionality  the software is excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this exclusion includes essential software that is sold with or embedded within the tangible products essential software 
asu also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that include both tangible products and software 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of asu on our financial position or results of operations
