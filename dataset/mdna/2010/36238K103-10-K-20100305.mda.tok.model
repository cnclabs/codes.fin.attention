item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in part ii  item of this form k 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
we use the terms gtsi  company  we  our  and us to refer to gtsi corp 
and its subsidiaries 
overview gtsi has over years of experience in selling it products and solutions primarily to us federal  state and local governments and to prime contractors who are working directly on government contracts 
we believe our key differentiators to be our strong brand among government customers  extensive contract portfolio  close relationships with wide variety of vendors  and a technology lifecycle management approach 
the it solutions we offer to our customers have a strong product component  along with a services component on many solutions 
we connect it s leading vendors  products and services inside the core technology areas most critical to government success by partnering with global it leaders such as cisco  sun microsystems  microsoft  hewlett packard  panasonic and network appliance 
gtsi has strong strategic relationships with hardware and software industry leading oems and includes these products in the solutions provided to our customers 
in  we have continued our realignment around solutions that we believe will provide us with a greater opportunity for sustained return on investment 
we directed our attention to government solutions  including mobile evidence capture  unified communications  mobile clinical applications  green it  virtualization and cloud computing 
to help our customers acquire  manage and refresh this technology in a strategic and application appropriate manner  gtsi has created a mix of professional and financial services capable of managing and funding the entire technology lifecycle 
additionally  gtsi offers leasing arrangements to allow government agencies to acquire access to technology as an evenly distributed operating expense  rather than on the much more budget sensitive and discontinuous capital expense basis 
we believe this model represents a distinctive advantage to our customers 
as discussed in more detail below our sales decreased approximately million  or  from to  gross margin decreased million however gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from to  in  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased approximately million however sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from to  our net income for the year ended december  was million  cash used in operations totaled million for the year ended december   our business experiences significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales  operating loss income and net loss income as a result of the buying patterns of the federal government  our primary customer 
in  our results were positively affected by the reversal of the tax valuation allowance of million  which was recorded as an income tax benefit and increased our net income by million or an increase of per share 
for additional details  see the further md a discussion below  and note and of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we continue to evolve as a provider of value added infrastructure solutions that include both products and services to our government and system integrator customers 
we are continually identifying and eliminating certain redundancies within the company and have terminated activities which have failed to yield adequate profitability 
in  we continued to be successful in providing technical assistance to support complex  multi vendor solutions and in priming as well as subcontracting with other service providers 
while the larger infrastructure solutions sales transactions represent a small percentage of our total transactions  they represent the majority of our margin and profits 
going forward  we will continue to focus on these larger  more profitable transactions  and drive processes and changes to make the delivery of the smaller transactions more profitable 
in addition  we will continue to take other action to maintain a profitable company 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most important to our financial condition and require management s significant judgments and estimates pertain to revenue recognition  transfer of receivables  valuation of inventory  capitalized internal use software  accounts payable and income taxes 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting estimates and policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales relates to physical products and is generally recognized when title and risk of loss to the products sold passes to the customer 
based on our standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
this requires us to analyze sales near the end of reporting periods to estimate the amount of products in transit to the customer that cannot be recognized as revenue 
many of our sales of physical products are shipped to our customers directly from our vendor partners 
the accurate recording of revenue for these transactions relies upon the accuracy of shipment dates we receive from our vendors and is subject to additional estimates and judgments by management 
in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition  the company recognizes software related revenue from re selling third party software licenses that do not require significant production  modification or customization  when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when a customer order contains multiple items such as hardware  software and services which are delivered at varying times  the company determines whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under fasb asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangement 
asc states that delivered items should be considered separate units of accounting if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in gtsi s control 
we also offer lease and other financing arrangements to customers to acquire technology 
these arrangements typically have terms from two to four years and are generally accounted for as sales type leases under fasb asc  leases 
certain of our service and solution agreements require the evaluation of pattern of performance 
revenues on professional service contracts are generally recognized using the proportional performance basis of accounting 
for some professional services engagements the completed performance method is used when there are customer specified subjective acceptance criteria 

table of contents at the time of sale  we record an estimate for product returns based on historical experience 
management reviews the assumptions regarding the lag time and volume of sales returns at least on a quarterly basis  and changes in the estimates are recorded in the period in which they occur 
in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition  customer payments and incentives  we record vendor rebates received under our vendor incentive programs pursuant to a binding arrangement as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation that results in progress by the company toward earning the rebate provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if the rebate is not probable and reasonably estimable  it is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
financing receivables we enter into complex agreements with our customers to provide it solutions with payment terms generally spread over a two to four year period 
usually we monetize these future revenue streams by selling such receivables to third party financial institutions 
we have master service agreements with multiple lenders each with varying terms 
these agreements  as well as the individual transaction agreements  require significant analysis to determine whether the transfer of the receivable should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral based on fasb asc  transfers and servicing  criteria that requires gtsi to effectively surrender control over the asset 
the technical accounting and legal requirements involved are complex and subject to interpretation 
significant judgment is required to determine if we have effectively surrendered control over the asset 
if certain criteria are met and control is surrendered  the transaction is recorded as financing revenue and associated expenses as cost of sales 
if the transfer does not meet the criteria for a sale  the transaction is reported as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral 
the collateral remains on our balance sheet and revenues and cost of sales are recognized over the term of the agreement 
differing conclusions in these statements could impact total assets  total liabilities  interest expense and earnings loss per share on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments on estimated fair values 
we adopted this standard using the modified prospective transition method 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we would be required to increase our expense to write down inventory to market value and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
capitalized internal use software significant judgment is required to determine what expenditures qualify for capitalization of internal use software 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task that it previously did not perform 
capitalized internal use software is required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair market value 

table of contents accounts payable we purchase significant amounts of inventory each year and record an estimate of the payable based on purchases as of the balance sheet date and the historic rate of purchase price variances  which is analyzed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
for products shipped directly from our vendors to our customers  management makes significant estimates regarding the payable for shipped goods 
as invoices are received  we record adjustments for purchase price variances 
changes in our estimate of the payable balance may be caused by changes in price between the order date and the receipt date related to volume discounts  changes in market rates  or special pricing promotions offered by our vendors 
bids and proposals we amortize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of a long term contract and that would have not been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract incremental direct acquisition costs 
as long term contracts are awarded the related up front incentive costs  which are specific incremental costs associated with the acquisition of long term contracts  are recorded as prepaid deferred assets and amortized over the term of the contract or five years  whichever is shorter 
income taxes determining our effective tax rate  provision for tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgments and estimates 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against assets  including net operating losses  if it is anticipated that the asset is not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions  which management believes are adequate 
as of december   management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized and no valuation allowance is required 
in  management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized and released the full valuation allowance of million based on our pre tax book income of approximately million and management s projections of future profitability 
our effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if we determine the allowance is or is not required  or if we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves

seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our operations as a result of the us federal government buying and funding patterns

new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets  which is included in the codification under fasb asc  transfers and servicing 
the guidance removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and requires enhanced disclosures to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
the guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  the adoption of this statement will not impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is included in the codification under fasb asc  consolidation 
the guidance affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this statement will not impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition 
these amendments  effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non software deliverable 
the guidance relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the individual deliverables 
also  the guidance expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance if the products contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
the guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after june   and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gtsi had a million credit facility indexed at the prime rate plus margin as of december  the company terminated the credit facility on may  and entered into a million credit agreement with castle pines capital llc cpc and other lenders the credit agreement  which includes inventory financing 
the credit agreement provides a vendor and distributor program under which we receive financing for inventory purchases from several of our largest cpc approved vendors with extended payment terms 
the credit agreement  which matures on may   carries an interest rate indexed at month libor plus basis points for revolving loan advances and month libor plus basis points for floor plan loans 
this credit agreement exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on borrowings under our credit agreement 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would require more cash to service our indebtedness 
as of december   the company had no outstanding loan balance other than non interest bearing floor plan loans and an available credit of million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt subject to interest 
we have not used derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our borrowings 
included in our long term debt are amounts related to lease transactions 
we have reported these amounts in note as long term financed lease debt 
these amounts will amortize over the period of the lease instruments with no cash affect to the company 
the balances of these liabilities were and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates would result in no additional interest expense related to financed lease debt
