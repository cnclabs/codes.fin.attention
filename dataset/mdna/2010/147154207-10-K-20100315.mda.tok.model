item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
the company s reserve for credit losses may not be adequate to cover future loan losses  which could adversely affect our earnings 
the company maintains a reserve for credit losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our portfolio 
while we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non performing  at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses that have not been identified as non performing or potential problem loans 
estimation of the allowance requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in our portfolio 
these assumptions and judgments include historical loan loss experience  current credit profiles of our borrowers  adverse situations that have occurred that may affect a borrower s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimated value of underlying collateral and general economic conditions 
determining the appropriateness of the reserve is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become non performing assets  or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified 
as a result  future significant increases to the reserve for credit losses may be necessary 
additionally  future increases to the reserve for credit losses may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising our loan portfolio  deteriorating values in underlying collateral most of which consists of real estate in the markets we serve and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions  or as a result of incorrect assumptions by management in determining the reserve for credit loss 
additionally  banking regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review our reserve for credit losses 
these regulatory agencies may require us to increase the reserve for credit losses which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
our primary funding source is commercial and retail deposits of our customers  brokered deposits  advances from the fhlb  frb discount window and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future depending on adverse results of operations  financial condition or capital ratings or regulatory restrictions 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
at the onset of the economic downturn in and through and early core deposits declined because customers in general experienced reduced funds available for core deposits 
as a result  the amount of our wholesale funding increased 
core deposits stabilized in late  and the company has established a significant liquidity reserve as of december  however our ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by our financial condition  regulatory restrictions  or impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as fdic insurance changes including the expiration of tag program  or further disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry 
we are presently restricted from accepting additional brokered deposits  including the bank s reciprocal certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
as of december   we had outstanding brokered deposits totaling million  of which will mature in the bank s primary counterparty for borrowing purposes is the fhlb  and liquid assets are mainly balances held at the frb 
available borrowing capacity has been reduced as we drew on our available sources 
borrowing capacity from the fhlb of seattle or frb may fluctuate based upon the condition of the bank or the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion  and the frb or fhlb of seattle could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings 
as with many community banks  correspondent banks have withdrawn unsecured lines of credit or now require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds on a short term basis due to the present adverse economic environment 
in addition  collateral pledged against public deposits held at the bank has been increased under oregon law to more than of such balances 
the bank is a public depository and  accordingly  accepts deposit funds that belong to  or are held for the benefit of  the state of oregon  political subdivisions thereof  municipal corporations and other public funds 
in accordance with applicable state law  in the event of default of one bank  all participating banks in the state collectively assure that no loss of funds is suffered by any public depositor 
generally in the event of default by a public depository  the assessment attributable to all public depositories is allocated on a pro rata basis in proportion to the maximum liability of each public depository as it existed on the date of loss 
the maximum liability is dependent upon potential changes in regulations  bank failures and the level of public fund deposits  all of which cannot be presently determined 
liquidity also may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
these circumstances have the effect of reducing secured borrowing capacity 
there can be no assurance that our sources of funds will remain adequate for our liquidity needs and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
the company s stock price has been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms to provide necessary liquidity  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
the company is seeking additional capital to improve capital ratios  but capital may not be available when it is needed 
the company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities  including under the obligations placed on the bank by the order  to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to offset elevated risks arising from adverse economic conditions  support our business  finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic 
table of contents conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
in that regard  current market conditions and investor uncertainty have made it very challenging for financial institutions in general to raise capital 
market conditions and investor sentiment prevented the company from raising capital through public and private offerings in the fourth quarter of if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects  in addition to any possible action discussed above  that the fdic or dfcs could take in connection with a failure to comply with or a violation of the order 
the company may not be able to obtain such financing or it may be only available on terms that are unfavorable to the company and its shareholders 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to the company s shareholders could result and securities issued in such financings may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
under the company s articles of incorporation  the company may issue preferred equity without first obtaining shareholder approval 
in addition  debt financing may include covenants that restrict our operations  and interest charges would detract from future earnings further  in the event additional capital is not available on acceptable terms through available financing sources  the company may instead take additional steps to preserve capital  including reducing loans outstanding  selling certain assets and increasing loan participations 
the company reduced its dividend to 
in the third quarter of  and eliminated its cash dividend at year end as part of its effort to preserve capital under current adverse economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that dividends on our common stock will be paid in the future  and if paid  at what amount 
real estate values may continue to decrease leading to additional and greater than anticipated loan charge offs and valuation write downs on our other real estate owned oreo properties 
real estate owned by the bank and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as other real estate owned or oreo property 
we foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for many of our loans as part of our business 
at december   we had oreo with a carrying value of million relating to loans originated in the raw land and land development portfolio and to a lesser extent  other loan portfolios 
increased oreo balances lead to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties 
we expect that our earnings in will continue to be negatively affected by various expenses associated with oreo  including personnel costs  insurance and taxes  completion and repair costs  and other costs associated with property ownership  as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in oreo 
moreover  our ability to sell oreo properties is affected by public perception that banks are inclined to accept large discounts from market value in order to quickly liquidate properties 
any decrease in market prices may lead to oreo write downs  with a corresponding expense in our statement of operations 
we evaluate oreo property values periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluations require it 
further write downs on oreo or an inability to sell oreo properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the company is not in compliance with certain continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
on december   the company received a notice letter from the nasdaq stock market regarding its non compliance with rule a of the nasdaq marketplace rules with respect to the minimum bid price requirement of per share 
the company s common stock has failed to meet the minimum bid price for consecutive business days 
in accordance with rule b of the nasdaq marketplace rules  the company has a calendar day grace period  or until june   to comply with the minimum bid price requirement 
to regain compliance  the bid price must meet or exceed per share for at least ten consecutive business days prior to june  the company will continue to evaluate its options with respect to meeting this listing qualification within the time period required 
if the company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by june   nasdaq will again provide written notification that the company s securities are subject to potential delisting 
at that time  the company may appeal the delisting determination to a nasdaq listing qualifications hearings panel 
a delisting of the company s common stock from the nasdaq stock market would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 

table of contents the bank s deposit insurance premium could be substantially higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
either an increase in the risk category of the bank or adjustments to the base assessment rates  and or a significant special assessment could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
in addition  the deposit insurance limit on fdic deposit insurance coverage generally has increased to  through december  these developments will cause the premiums assessed on us by the fdic to increase and will materially increase our noninterest expense 
on february   the fdic issued a final rule that revises the way the fdic calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of under the new rule  the fdic first establishes an institution s initial base assessment rate 
this initial base assessment rate will range  depending on the risk category of the institution  from to basis points 
the fdic will then adjust the initial base assessment higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
the adjustments to the initial base assessment rate will be based upon an institution s levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and certain brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate will range from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
additionally  on may   the fdic announced a final rule imposing a special emergency assessment as of june   payable september   of basis points on each fdic insured deposit any institution s assets  less tier capital  as of june   but the amount of the assessment is capped at basis points of domestic deposits 
the final rule also allows the fdic to impose additional special emergency assessments on or after september   of up to basis points per quarter  if necessary to maintain public confidence in fdic insurance 
these higher fdic assessment rates and special assessments will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are unable to predict the impact in future periods  including whether and when additional special assessments will occur  in the event the economic crisis continues 
however  the fdic has indicated that for now it will not impose additional special assessments but instead is requiring institutions to prepay certain assessments 
on november   the fdic issued a final rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions were required to prepay on december  their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and under the rule  however  the fdic has the authority to exempt an institution from the prepayment requirements if the fdic determines that the prepayment would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the institution 
the bank has received an exemption from the prepayment requirements 
the bank will continue to pay its insurance assessments on a quarterly basis 
we also participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
banks that participate in the tlgp s noninterest bearing transaction account guarantee program in generally paid the fdic an annual assessment of basis points on the amounts in such accounts above the amounts covered by fdic deposit insurance 
the guarantee program has been extended through december  beginning in  participants will be assessed at an annual rate of between and basis points on the amounts in the guaranteed accounts in excess of the amounts covered by the fdic deposit insurance 
to the extent that these tlgp assessments are insufficient to cover any loss or expenses arising from the tlgp program  the fdic is authorized to impose an emergency special assessment on all fdic insured depository institutions 
the fdic has authority to impose charges for the tlgp program upon depository institution holding companies as well 
these charges  along with the full utilization of our fdic deposit insurance assessment credit in early  will cause the premiums and tlgp assessments charged by the fdic to increase 
these actions have significantly increased our noninterest expense in and will likely do so for the foreseeable future 

table of contents changes in interest rates could adversely impact the company 
the company s earnings are highly dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
in addition  changes to the market interest rates may impact the level of loans  deposits and investments  and the credit quality of existing loans 
these rates may be affected by many factors beyond the company s control  including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in interest rates may negatively impact the company s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive regulation which undergoes frequent and often significant changes 
the company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state banking authorities which impose requirements and restrictions on the company s operations 
the regulations affect the company s and the bank s investment practices  lending activities  and dividend policy  among other things 
moreover  federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent and often significant changes and have been subject to significant change in recent years  sometimes retroactively applied  and may change significantly in the future 
changes to these laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could  among other things  make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for the company  could limit the products the company and the bank can offer or increase the ability of non banks to compete and could adversely affect the company in significant but unpredictable ways which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with the laws or regulations could result in fines  penalties  sanctions and damage to the company s reputation which could have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the financial services business is intensely competitive and our success will depend on our ability to compete effectively 
the company faces competition for its services from a variety of competitors 
the company s future growth and success depends on its ability to compete effectively 
the company competes for deposits  loans and other financial services with numerous financial service providers including banks  thrifts  credit unions  mortgage companies  broker dealers  and insurance companies 
to the extent these competitors have less regulatory constraints  lower cost structures  or increased economies of scale they may be able to offer a greater variety of products and services or more favorable pricing for such products and services 
improvements in technology  communications and the internet have intensified competition 
as a result  the company s competitive position could be weakened  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies on its computer information systems in the conduct of its business 
the company has policies and procedures in place to protect against and reduce the occurrences of failures  interruptions  or breaches of security of these systems  however  there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will eliminate the occurrence of failures  interruptions or breaches of security or that they will adequately restore or minimize any such events 
the occurrence of a failure  interruption or breach of security of the company s computer information systems could result in a loss of information  business or regulatory scrutiny  or other events  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services in the financial services industry result in the need for rapid technological change 
in addition  the effective use of technology may result in improved customer service and reduced costs 
the company s future success depends  to a certain extent  on its ability to identify the needs of our customers and address those needs by using technology to provide the 
table of contents desired products and services and to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
certain competitors may have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to successfully implement new technology driven products and services or to effectively market these products and services to our customers 
failure to implement the necessary technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item a controls and procedures of this report for a more detailed discussion of our controls and procedures 
cascade bancorp relies on dividends from the bank 
cascade bancorp is a separate legal entity from the bank and substantially all of our revenues are derived from bank dividends 
these dividends may be limited by certain federal and state laws and regulations 
in addition  any distribution of assets of the bank upon a liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior liens of the bank s creditors 
because of the elevated credit risk and associated loss incurred in and  regulators have required the company to seek permission prior to payment of dividends on common stock or on trust preferred securities 
in addition  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to seek permission prior to payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
the company cut its dividend to zero in the fourth quarter of and deferred payments on its trust preferred securities beginning in the second quarter of we do not expect the bank to pay dividends to cascade bancorp for the foreseeable future 
cascade bancorp does not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future 
cascade bancorp is unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it pays all accrued payments on its trust preferred securities 
as of october   we had million of tps outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
the company elected to defer payments on its tps beginning in the second quarter of and as of october   accrued dividends were million 
if the bank is unable to pay dividends to cascade bancorp in the future  cascade bancorp may not be able to pay dividends on its stock or pay interest on its debt  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company may not be able to attract or retain key banking employees 
we expect our future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with our clients by our executives and senior lending officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with several members of senior management 
the existence of such agreements  however  does not necessarily ensure that we will be able to continue to retain their services 
the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings 
the company strives to attract and retain key banking professionals  management and staff 
competition to attract the best professionals in the industry can be intense which will limit the company s ability to hire new professionals 
banking related revenues and net income could be adversely affected in the event of the unexpected loss of key personnel 
the value of certain securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in the market for these securities 
the company s investment portfolio securities are mainly mortgage backed securities guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises such as fnma  gnma  fhlmc and fhlb  or otherwise backed by fha va guaranteed loans  however  volatility or illiquidity in financial markets may cause certain investment securities held within our investment portfolio to become less liquid 
this coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the credit risk associated with the underlying collateral or guarantors may cause material 
table of contents discrepancies in valuation estimates obtained from third parties 
volatile market conditions may affect the value of securities through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  equity  and capital ratios 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 
fnma is no longer allowing the bank to sell its mortgages to fnma and may potentially force the sale of our msr s on november   fnma informed the bank that as a result of the bank s capital ratios falling below contractual requirements the bank no longer qualified as a fnma designated mortgage loan seller or servicer and the bank had until december  to improve its capital ratios to meet fnma s requirements 
as of december   the bank had not met such requirements  and  accordingly  fnma has terminated the bank s rights to originate and sell mortgage loans directly to fnma 
in addition  fnma now has the option to terminate its mortgage servicing agreement with the bank  upon which occurrence the bank would no longer be allowed to service fnma loans in the future 
management is in the process of discussing such issues with fnma and has been evaluating the prospective impact of this development 
possible outcomes include a reduction of the company s mortgage banking and mortgage servicing revenues in the future and sale or forced transfer of its mortgage servicing business to a third party by fnma 
as a result of the actions by fnma  the company anticipates that the majority of mortgage loans originated in future periods will be sold to other third parties and that the bank will not retain servicing rights 
the company expects that this may result in a significant decrease to future net mortgage servicing income 
management believes that under the circumstances  fnma will provide the company with sufficient time to accomplish an orderly disposition of its msrs 
however  there can be no assurance that fnma will provide for an orderly process nor that a reduction of mortgage banking revenues or possible impairment of msrs will not occur 
because the estimated fair value of the company s msrs exceeds book value at december   and because management believes it is unlikely fnma will preemptively transfer the company s msrs to a third party  no impairment adjustment has been made in connection with this issue as of december  in addition  no valuation allowance for msrs was recorded as of december  and

the company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances after the date hereof 
readers should carefully review all disclosures filed by the company from time to time with the sec 
recent developments in october  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec pursuant to which it intended to offer up to million of its common stock in a public offering  subject to market and other conditions including consummation of the previously announced private offerings with mr 
david f 
bolger bolger and an affiliate of lightyear fund ii  lp lightyear 
on december   the company announced the withdrawal of the registration statement due to market and other conditions 
on february   the company entered into amendments to the stock purchase agreements with each of bolger and lightyear which  among other things  extended the stock purchase agreements to 
table of contents may  in order to provide the company additional time to implement a capital raise 
because capital raising in the current economic environment is very limited  it is uncertain whether the bank will be able to increase its capital to required levels 
on november   fnma informed the bank that as a result of the bank s capital ratios falling below contractual requirements the bank no longer qualified as a fnma designated mortgage loan seller or servicer and the bank had until december  to improve its capital ratios to meet fnma s requirements 
as of december   the bank had not met such requirements  and  accordingly  fnma has terminated the bank s rights to originate and sell mortgage loans directly to fnma 
in addition  fnma now has the option to terminate its mortgage servicing agreement with the bank  upon which occurrence the bank would no longer be allowed to service fnma loans in the future 
management is in the process of discussing such issues with fnma and has been evaluating the prospective impact of this development 
possible outcomes include a reduction of the company s mortgage banking and mortgage servicing revenues in the future and sale or forced transfer of its mortgage servicing business to a third party by fnma 
as a result of the actions by fnma  the company anticipates that the majority of mortgage loans originated in future periods will be sold to other third parties and that the bank will not retain servicing rights 
the company expects that this may result in a significant decrease to future net mortgage servicing income 
management believes that under the circumstances  fnma will provide the company with sufficient time to accomplish an orderly disposition of its msrs 
however  there can be no assurance that fnma will provide for an orderly process nor that a reduction of mortgage banking revenues or possible impairment of msrs will not occur 
because the estimated fair value of the company s msrs exceeds book value at december   and because management believes it is unlikely fnma will preemptively transfer the company s msrs to a third party  no impairment adjustment has been made in connection with this issue as of december  in addition  no valuation allowance for msrs was recorded as of december  and on december   the company received a notice letter from the nasdaq stock market regarding its non compliance with rule a of the nasdaq marketplace rules with respect to the minimum bid price requirement of per share 
the company s common stock has failed to meet the minimum bid price for consecutive business days 
the notice letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
the company has a calendar day grace period  or until june   to comply with the minimum bid price requirement 
to regain compliance  the bid price must meet or exceed per share for at least ten consecutive business days prior to june  the company will continue to evaluate its options with respect to meeting this listing qualification within the time period required 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows reserve for credit losses the company s reserve for credit losses provides for possible losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and related loan commitments 
arriving at an estimate of the appropriate level of reserve for credit losses reserve for loan losses and loan commitments involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in a methodology with relatively complex calculations and analysis 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as consideration of the prevailing business environment 
on an ongoing basis the company seeks to refine its methodology such that the reserve is responsive to the effect that qualitative and environmental factors have upon the loan portfolio 
however  external factors and changing economic conditions may impact the portfolio and the level of reserves in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
the reserve for loan commitments is increased and decreased through non interest expense 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  see reserve for credit losses later in this report 

table of contents other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the reserve for loans losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expenses 
mortgage servicing rights msrs determination of the fair value of msrs requires the estimation of multiple interdependent variables  the most impactful of which is mortgage prepayment speeds 
prepayment speeds are estimates of the pace and magnitude of future mortgage payoff or refinance behavior of customers whose loans are serviced by the company 
errors in estimation of prepayment speeds or other key servicing variables could subject msrs to impairment risk 
on a quarterly basis  the company engages a qualified third party to provide an estimate of the fair value of msrs using a discounted cash flow model with assumptions and estimates based upon observable market based data and methodology common to the mortgage servicing market 
management believes it applies reasonable assumptions under the circumstances  however  because of possible volatility in the market price of msrs  and the vagaries of any relatively illiquid market  there can be no assurance that risk management and existing accounting practices will result in the avoidance of possible impairment charges in future periods 
please see recent developments above for additional information related to fnma and the bank s designation as a seller servicer 
see also non interest income below and note of the company s condensed consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates deferred income tax assets for recoverability based on all available evidence 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws  our ability to successfully implement tax planning strategies  or variances between our future projected operating performance and our actual results 
the company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the more likely than not criterion  we evaluate all positive and negative available evidence as of the end of each reporting period 
future adjustments to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  if any  will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred income tax assets 
the realization of the deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under the tax law 
due to the company s cumulative tax losses in and it was determined that as of december   the company was not able to meet the more likely than not standard as to realization of the deferred tax asset and accordingly established an allowance against such asset 
economic conditions the company s business is closely tied to the economies of idaho and oregon in general and is particularly affected by the economies of central  southern and northwest oregon  as well as the greater boise  idaho area 
the uncertain depth and duration of the present economic downturn could continue to cause further deterioration of these local economies  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
real estate values in these areas have declined and may continue to fall 
unemployment rates in these areas have increased significantly and could increase further 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been impacted and local governments and many businesses are facing serious challenges due to the lack of consumer spending driven by elevated unemployment and uncertainty 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the declining value of collateral securing those loans  is reflective of the business environment in the markets where the company operates 
the present significant downturn in economic activity and declining real estate values has had a direct and adverse effect on the condition and results of operations of the company 
this is particularly evident in the residential land 
table of contents development and residential construction segments of the company s loan portfolio 
developers or home builders whose cash flows are dependent on the sale of lots or completed residences have reduced ability to service their loan obligations and the market value of underlying collateral has been and continues to be adversely affected 
the impact on the company has been an elevated level of impaired loans  an associated increase in provisioning expense and charge offs for the company leading to a net loss in and of million and million  respectively 
the local and regional economy also has a direct impact on the volume of bank deposits 
core deposits have declined since mid because business and retail customers have realized a reduction in cash available to deposit in the bank 
however  core deposits showed signs of stabilization in the latter part of financial highlights and summary of q and full year plan given the economic environment and its affect on the financial condition of the company  the following objectives and plans have been implemented and are expected to be continued in the company continues its efforts to raise additional capital through the sale of its common stock in one or more private offerings  the company has implemented strategies and plans to stabilize and reduce its the level of problem loans and minimizing the severity of associated credit losses to the extent possible  the company has reduced the size of the loan portfolio to lower credit risk and conserve capital and liquidity  the company has worked to stabilize its core deposits and has funded a significant contingent liquidity reserve  and the company has implemented plans to reduce controllable non interest expense 
fourth quarter the company recorded a net loss of per share or million in the fourth quarter of as compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ago quarter 
the quarterly loss was mainly attributable to a million provision for loan losses  a million charge to create a full allowance against the deferred tax assets at december   million in oreo disposition costs and expenses  and a million prepayment penalty to extinguish certain higher rate fhlb borrowings 
additionally  net interest income was million lower than in the linked quarter due to reduced average loans outstanding and million interest reversed on non performing loans 
during the quarter the company took significant steps to maximize the benefit of recent legislation that extended for losses only net operating loss tax carryback to years 
these actions resulted in the company recording a million tax receivable at year end  which is expected to be realized upon filing of our tax return 
tax optimization related endeavors included proactive sales of oreo properties  charge offs and note sales on troubled loans  and prepayment of certain fhlb advances 
linked quarter credit metrics improved with npa s including oreo down along with reduced levels of classified and criticized assets 
the net interest margin for the quarter was up at compared to in the linked quarter primarily resulting from lower average npa s and lower levels of interest reversals on non performing loans compared to the prior quarter 
in october  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec pursuant to which it intended to offer up to million of its common stock in a public offering  subject to market and other conditions including consummation of the previously announced private offerings with bolger and lightyear 
on december   the company announced the withdrawal of the registration statement due to market and other conditions 
on february   the company entered into amendments to the stock purchase agreements with each of bolger and lightyear which  among other things  extended the stock purchase agreements to may  in order to provide the company additional time to implement a capital raise 
because of the company s financial condition and challenging capital market conditions it is uncertain whether the bank will be able to increase its capital to required levels 
full year the company recorded a net loss of million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share for the annual loss was mainly attributable to elevated credit quality related expenses  a substantial charge against existing deferred tax assets  and lower net interest income primarily because of lower average loan yields and a decline in loans outstanding coupled with a higher volume of non performing assets 
for the year  the company recorded million provision for 
table of contents loan losses and million in oreo valuation and disposition costs and related expenses reflecting adverse economic conditions effect on borrower s ability to repay loan obligations 
this compares with million in provision for loan losses expense and million oreo costs in in addition  the company recorded a million charge to create a full allowance against the company s deferred tax assets at december  in order to mitigate credit risk and conserve capital and liquidity  the bank reduced its loan balances by million for the year  but as a consequence net interest income for the year was down million due to lower earning asset volumes and the effect of interest reversals and interest foregone on non performing loans 
core deposits appeared to stabilize in the latter half of and balances were near levels from the prior year end 
non interest income was up million in compared to largely because of our gain on sale of merchant services business 
meanwhile human resource costs and controllable discretionary non interest expenses were decreased in compared to the prior year 
however  total non interest expense increased year over year because of a million in oreo related expenses including valuation charges and loss on sale compared to million in the prior year 
results of operations years ended december   and net income loss the company recorded a net loss of million or per share in compared to a net loss of million or per share for and net income of million in or per share 
the loss in primarily resulted from a decrease in net interest income of million  million loan loss provision  a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million  and oreo expenses of million 
the loss in mainly resulted from the company s non cash impairment of goodwill in the amount of million  a million loan loss provision as well as a decrease in net interest income of million 
net interest income net interest margin for most financial institutions  including the company  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned  principally from loans and investment securities portfolio  and interest paid  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income typically result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income decreased approximately million or for due mainly to lower average earning assets and interest reversals and interest foregone on non performing loans 
in interest income was down by million or as compared to primarily because of lower average yields  including interest reversed  and interest foregone on non performing loans 
total interest expense declined by approximately million or for primarily due to lower rates 
interest expense dropped million or for as compared to as a result of lower rates and reduced volumes of interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
accordingly  net interest income decreased to million or in over net interest income decreased million or in over yields earned on assets decreased to for as compared to in and in meanwhile  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for decreased to compared to in and in the company s net interest margin nim decreased to for as compared to for three factors contributed to the lower nim for the year ended december   including interest forgone and reversed on npa s  an elevated level of assets held at the frb for contingent liquidity purposes  lower average customer balances in non interest bearing deposit accounts  and the effect of lower market interest rates on the company s asset and liability mix 
the margin can also be affected by factors beyond market interest rates  including loan or deposit volume shifts and or aggressive rate offerings by competitor institutions 
the company s financial model indicates a relatively stable interest rate risk profile within a reasonable range of rate movements around the forward rates currently predicted by financial markets 

table of contents components of net interest margin the following table presents further analysis of the components of cascade s net interest margin and sets forth for   and information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant average yields or rates  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities for the company

there can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan related losses or that additional provision expense will not be required should economic conditions remain adverse

non interest income total non interest income decreased in compared to after excluding the one time gain of million on the sale of the merchant card processing business 
service charges on deposit accounts were down million  card issuer and merchant service fees were down million and earnings on bank owned life insurance was down million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in mortgage banking income  gains on sales of investment securities available for sale and other income

table of contents mortgage banking income home mortgage originations and mortgage related revenue the company provides residential mortgage services on a direct to customer basis and does no business through third party brokerage channels 
the company has focused its originations in conventional mortgage products while avoiding sub prime option arm type products 
the low delinquency rate within the company s loan servicing portfolio underscores this long held discipline in mortgage origination 
at december   the portfolio contained about  mortgage loans totaling million with a delinquency rate of loans past due days of only  notably below the mortgage bankers association mba national mortgage delinquency rate of at september  residential mortgage originations totaled million in  up when compared to million in related net mortgage revenue was million  an increase of compared to million for the previous year 
non interest income arising from mortgage servicing totaled approximately million in the general level and direction of interest rates directly influence the volume and profitability of the yield curve in mortgage banking 
a lower interest rate climate continued in and which had the affect of decreasing the profitability of mortgage banking due to a lower interest rate yield curve 
historically  the company sold a predominant portion of its residential mortgage loans to fannie mae  a us government sponsored enterprise and other secondary market investors 
the company services such loans for fannie mae and is paid approximately 
per annum on the outstanding balances for providing this service 
such revenues are included in the above mortgage banking results 
mortgages serviced for fannie mae totaled million at december   an increase over million at december  and an increase over million at december  the related mortgage servicing rights msrs were approximately million in and million in as described under recent developments  the bank received a letter from fnma advising that the bank failed to meet fnma s minimum required total risk based capital ratio of as of september  the letter stated that the bank was being suspended as a fannie mae seller servicer effective immediately 
it was noted that failure to meet applicable standards would result in termination of the bank s selling and servicing contract 
as of december   and through the date of this report  the bank does not meet fnma s minimum financial standards 
as a result  the company may not sell mortgage loans to fnma and fnma may terminate its agreement to allow the company to service fnma loans in the future 
mortgage loans not sold to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or fnma  are generally sold servicing released to other secondary market investors 
loans sold on this basis generate no future servicing fees for the company 
the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights msr portfolio is estimated to exceed book value by amounts ranging from million to million 
the company capitalizes the estimated market value of msrs into income upon the sale of each originated mortgage loan 
the company amortizes msrs in proportion to the servicing income it receives from fannie mae over the estimated life of the underlying mortgages  considering prepayment expectations and refinancing patterns 
in addition  the company amortizes  in full  any remaining msrs balance that is specifically associated with a serviced loan that is refinanced or paid off 
at december   expressed as a percentage of loans serviced  the book value of msr was 
of serviced mortgage loans  while fair value was approximately 
of serviced mortgages 
fair value as a percentage of loans serviced was estimated at 
a year earlier

oreo expenses were million in compared to million in and were only million in oreo costs and valuation adjustments increased million for compared to  primarily due to depressed real estate values on foreclosed land development properties 
in addition  fdic deposit insurance assessments increased million or in when compared to  reflecting 
table of contents the fdic s higher base assessment rate for and expenses related to the fdic s industry wide emergency special assessment in the second quarter 
fdic premiums have increased due to the rise in financial institution failures in and  the company s voluntary participation in the temporary liquidity guarantee program and the fdic s rates applicable to banks in the company s regulatory classification 
professional fees increased million or which includes legal  accounting and other professional services in connection with the company s efforts to raise capital in the fourth quarter of meanwhile  the company continued to see a reduction in salary expenses  and employee benefits expenses declined as staffing continues to be trimmed in response to the slowing economy  no executive bonuses were paid in  or total non interest expense for increased to million as compared to primarily due to the noncash after tax goodwill impairment charge and expenses related to the company s oreo properties 
human resource costs were down in compared to as executive bonuses were foregone in both and the company s efficiency ratio was in compared to in income taxes as of december   the company had recorded refundable income taxes receivable of approximately million related to the carryback of operating losses to prior years and had provided a million charge to create a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets

a portion of the reduction in loan balances was the result of net loan charge offs of million for the reduction in loan balances has resulted in lower credit risk exposure and has helped to support the bank s regulatory capital ratios 
funding sources have increased in  including tlgp debt issuance and internet listing service deposits

real estate loan concentration risk 
real estate loans have historically represented a significant portion of the company s overall loan portfolio and real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
approximately two thirds of total loans have exposure to real estate  including construction and lot loans comprised of land development plus residential and commercial construction loan types  commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  and consumer real estate 
risks associated 
table of contents with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  demand and prices for housing or commercial properties  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and concentration within the bank s market area 
the following paragraphs provide information on portions of the company s real estate loan portfolio  specifically construction lot and commercial real estate 
all such lending activities are subject to the varied risks of real estate lending 
the company s loan origination process requires specialized underwriting  collateral and approval procedures  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk that loans may not be repaid 
note that the minor balance differences between the preceding and following tables are a result of the inclusion of net deferred loan fees in the above tables 
a residential land development category 
this category is included in the construction lot portfolio balances above  and represents loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots 
such loans typically finance land purchase and infrastructure development of properties ie roads  utilities  etc 
with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sale to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units 
the primary source of repayment of such loans is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land while real estate collateral  secondary sources and personal guarantees may provide an additional measure of security for such loans 
the nationwide downturn in real estate has continued to slow down lot and home sales within the company s markets 
this has adversely impacted certain developers by lengthening the marketing period of their projects and negatively affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values 
weakness in this category of loans has contributed significantly to the elevated level of provision for loan losses in and the situation continues to be closely monitored and an elevated level of provisioning may be required should deterioration continue

this category is included in the construction lot portfolio balances above  and represents financing of homeowner or builder construction of new residences and condominiums where the obligor generally intends to own the home upon construction pre sold  or builder construction of homes for resale speculative construction 
pre sold construction loans are underwritten to facilitate permanent mortgage take out financing at the end of the construction phase 
especially with the turmoil in mortgage markets of the last year  no assurance can be made that committed take out financing will be available at conclusion of construction 
speculative construction lending finances builders contractors who rely on the sale of completed homes to repay loans 
the bank may finance construction costs within residential subdivisions or on a custom site basis 
speculative construction loans decreased in as a result of the nationwide downturn in residential real estate 
this may impact certain builders by lengthening the marketing period for constructed homes and negatively affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values

this category is included in the construction lot portfolio balances above  and represents lending to finance the construction or development of commercial properties 
obligors may be the business owner occupier of the building who intends to operate its business from the property upon construction  or non owner speculative developers 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase 
in certain circumstances  the company may provide or commit to take out financing upon construction 
take out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines 
the overall decline in in our commercial construction portfolio is mainly related to project completions 
while our portfolios of these types of loans have not experienced the severe credit quality challenges experienced in residential construction projects  there can be no assurance that the credit quality in these portfolios will not be impacted should present challenging economic conditions persist 
no assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the estimates that are currently included in the reserve for credit losses  which could adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

central oregon of total cre loans northwest oregon of total cre loans southern oregon of total cre loans idaho of total cre loans total commercial real estate owner occupied    non owner occupied   total loans    lending and credit management 
the company has a comprehensive risk management process to control  underwrite  monitor and manage credit risk in lending 
the underwriting of loans relies principally on an analysis of an obligor s historical and prospective cash flow augmented by collateral assessment  credit bureau information  as well as business plan assessment 
ongoing loan portfolio monitoring is performed by a centralized credit administration function including review and testing of compliance to loan policies and procedures 
internal and external auditors and bank regulatory examiners periodically sample and test certain credit files as well 
risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  which could result in the classification of such loans as non performing 
certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
reserve for credit losses 
the reserve for credit losses reserve for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments represents management s recognition of the assumed and present risks of extending credit and the possible inability or failure of the obligors to make repayment 
the reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses on loans and unfunded commitments based on management s current assessment of a variety of current factors affecting the loan portfolio 
such factors include loss experience  review of problem loans  current economic conditions  and an overall evaluation of the quality  risk characteristics and concentration of loans in the portfolio 
the level of reserve for credit losses is also subject to review by the bank regulatory authorities who may require increases to the reserve based on their evaluation of the information available to it at the time of its examination of the bank 
the reserve is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
see income statement overview loan loss provision above 
the following describes the company s methodology for assessing the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses 
for this purpose  loans and related commitments to loan are analyzed and reserves categorized into the allocated reserve  specifically identified reserves for impaired loans  the unallocated reserve  or the reserve for unfunded loan commitments 
the allocated portion of the reserve and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances and commitments to loan  segregated by differing risk categories 
loss factors are based on historical loss experience  adjusted for current economic trends  portfolio concentrations and other conditions affecting the portfolio 
in certain circumstances with respect to adversely risk rated loans  loss factors may utilize information as to estimated collateral values  secondary sources of 
table of contents repayment  guarantees and other relevant factors 
the allocated portion of the consumer loan reserve is estimated based mainly upon a quarterly credit scoring analysis 
impaired loans are either specifically allocated for in the reserve for loan losses or reflected as a partial charge off of the loan balance 
the bank considers loans to be impaired when management believes that it is probable that either principal and or interest amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral or related guaranty 
since a significant portion of the bank s loans are collateralized by real estate  the bank primarily measures impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral or related guaranty 
in certain other cases  impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
smaller balance homogeneous loans typically installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual installment loans for impairment disclosures 
generally  the bank evaluates a loan for impairment when a loan is determined to be adversely risk rated 
the unallocated portion of the reserve is based upon management s evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the allocated and specific reserves 
such factors include uncertainties in economic conditions  uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates  risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors  regulatory examinations  and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
in addition  the unallocated reserve may be further adjusted based upon the direction of various risk indicators 
examples of such factors include the risk as to current and prospective economic conditions  the level and trend of charge offs or recoveries  levels and trends in delinquencies or non accrual loans  risks in originating loans in new or unfamiliar markets  risk of heightened imprecision of appraisals used in estimating real estate values  or initiating specialty lending to industry sectors that may be new to the company 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate  the total reserve for credit losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the reserve for loan losses  the relationship of the unallocated component to the total reserve for loan losses may fluctuate from period to period 
as of year end the company s unallocated reserve balance was approximately of its calculated reserve based upon the management s assessment of elevated risk factors mainly relating to uncertain and adverse economic conditions and the level and trend of delinquencies  nonaccrual loans and charge offs 
the bank s ratio of reserve for credit losses to total loans was at december  compared to at december  and at december  at this date  management believes that the company s reserve is at an appropriate level under current circumstances and prevailing economic conditions 
the total amount of actual loan losses may vary significantly from the estimated amount 
no assurance can be given that in any particular period  the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient  or that loan losses will not be sustained that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that changing economic factors or other environmental conditions could cause increases in the loan loss provision 
the company classifies reserves for unfunded commitments as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
such reserves are included as part of the overall reserve for credit losses 
reserves for unfunded commitments totaled approximately and  at december  and  respectively 
allocation of reserve for credit losses 
the higher reserve for loan losses in recent years is attributable to the affect the adverse economy has had on obligor s ability to repay loans 
the unallocated portion of the reserve reflects the level of uncertainty as to the future direction and severity of the economic environment 
while a combination of evidence demonstrating greater clarity on construction lot exposure and reduced exposure levels has lessened concern in this loan portfolio  risk in other asset categories continues 
typical factors leading to changes in reserve allocation include changes in debt service coverage ratios  guarantor and or collateral valuation as well as economic conditions that may have a specific or generalized impact on the relative risks inherent in various 
table of contents loan portfolios 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate  the total reserve for loan losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
the following table allocates the reserve for credit losses among major loan types

the accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when  in management s judgment  the future collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt 
loans placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time of such determination  and may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse  and charge against current income  interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest subsequently collected on such loans is credited to loan principal if  in the opinion of management  full collectibility of principal is doubtful 
interest income that was reversed and charged against income for was million  million in and in during our normal loan review procedures  a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are currently measured at lower of cost or fair value 
certain large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  collectively measured for impairment  are excluded 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
in addition  net overdraft losses are included in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses per the guidance provided by regulatory authorities early in  in joint guidance on overdraft protection programs 
at december   the company s recorded investment in certain loans that were considered to be impaired was million and specific valuation allowances were million 
impaired loans were million with specific valuation allowances of at year end at december   the company had three borrowers with loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings tdrs totaling million  or of total assets

in addition  local relationship based reciprocal cdars deposits totaled million at december  and million at december  however  banks that fail to be well capitalized are restricted from accessing wholesale brokered deposits 
further  the order restricts the bank s ability to accept additional brokered deposits  including the bank s reciprocal cdar s program  for which it previously had a temporary waiver from the fdic

the purpose of the company s million of trust preferred securities was to fund the cash portion of the f m holding company acquisition in  to support general corporate purposes and to augment regulatory capital 
management believes that at december   the tps meet applicable regulatory guidelines to qualify as tier i capital in the amount of million and tier capital in the amount of million 
at december   the tps met applicable regulatory guidelines to qualify as tier i capital and tier capital in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company s obligations under the junior subordinated debentures the debentures and related agreements  taken together  constitute a full and irrevocable guarantee by the company of the obligations of the trusts 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon the maturity of the debentures  or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture related to the debentures 
the trust preferred securities may be called by the company at par at varying times subsequent to september   and may be redeemed earlier upon the occurrence of certain events that impact the income tax or the regulatory capital treatment of the trust preferred securities 
in october  the company entered into a binding letter agreement with cohen company financial management  llc for the restructuring of the company s tps 
pursuant to the letter agreement  at such time that a capital raise transaction is agreed  the company will exchange the tps for senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million representing of the original balance of the tps 
subsequent to the capital raise the notes will be extinguished for cash and liability for tps debt will be fully extinguished  resulting in an after tax gain of approximately million for the company 
the agreements with bolger and lightyear including their respective contributions of capital are contingent upon the execution of this transaction 
the exchange of the tps for the notes will have no effect on capital at the bank and does not impact the amount of capital needed by the bank to comply with the order

regulatory benchmarks for an adequately capitalized designation are  and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively  well capitalized benchmarks are   and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively 
however  as mentioned elsewhere in this report  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
additional information regarding capital resources are located in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item this report 
federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure of capital deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulator for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
at december   the company does not meet the regulatory benchmarks for adequately capitalized institutions 
as mentioned earlier in this report the bank is under a regulatory order 
under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures to improve its capital position  maintain liquidity ratios  reduce its level of non performing assets  reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios  improve management practices and board supervision and to assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level 
while the bank successfully completed several of the measures under the order  it was unable to implement certain measures in the time frame provided  particularly those related to raising capital levels 
among the corrective actions required are for the bank to develop and adopt a plan to maintain the minimum capital requirements for a well capitalized bank  including a tier leverage ratio of at least at the bank level beginning days from the issuance of the order 
as of december  and through the date of this report  the requirement relating to increasing the bank s tier leverage ratio has not been met 
bank level capital ratios set forth below are substantially higher than the capital ratios at the company level 
this is mainly because regulatory calculations give different treatment to the million in trust preferred debt proceeds 
at the company level substantial percentage of trust preferred debt is excluded from regulatory capital  while it is fully included at bank level 
at december   the company s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  and the bank s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  which do not meet regulatory benchmarks for adequately capitalized 
regulatory benchmarks for an adequately capitalized designation are  and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively  well capitalized 
table of contents benchmarks are   and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively 
however  as mentioned above  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
from time to time the company makes commitments to acquire banking properties or to make equipment or technology related investments of capital 
at december   the company had no material capital expenditure commitments apart from those incurred in the ordinary course of business 
liquidity and sources of funds the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
core relationship deposits are the primary source of the bank s liquidity 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
the company views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
the bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts  and a lesser percentage in time deposits 
bancorp is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the bank 
such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank 
banking regulations and authorities may limit the amount or require certain approvals of the dividend that the bank may pay to bancorp 
pursuant to the order  the bank is required to seek permission from its regulators prior to payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
the company cut its dividend to zero in the fourth quarter of and deferred payments on its trust preferred securities beginning in the second quarter of we do not expect the bank to pay dividends to cascade bancorp for the foreseeable future 
cascade bancorp does not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future 
cascade bancorp is unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it pays all accrued payments on its trust preferred securities 
as of october   we had million of tps outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
the company elected to defer payments on its tps beginning in the second quarter of and as of october   accrued dividends were million 
to build contingent liquidity in response to challenging deposit market conditions including restrictions on acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits  the bank has worked to stabilize and retain local deposits  by accessing internet listing service deposits  and by reducing its loan balances 
at december   liquid assets of the bank are mainly balances held at frb totaling million compared to million at prior quarter end and a negligible amount at december  because of the economic situation  the condition of the bank and other uncertainties no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity 
at december  the internet sourced deposits were approximately million compared to a de minimus balance at year end such deposits are sourced by posting time deposit rates on an internet site where institutions seeking to deploy funds contact the bank directly to open a deposit account 
at december  wholesale brokered deposits totaled million down from million at december  andlocal relationship based reciprocal cdars deposits totaled million at december  and million at december  which are also technically classified as brokered deposits 
the bank is currently restricted from accepting or renewing brokered deposits 
available borrowing capacity has been reduced as the company drew on its available sources 
at december   the fhlb had extended the bank a secured line of credit of million that may be accessed for short or long term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral 
as of december   the bank had qualifying collateral pledged for fhlb borrowings totaling million which was largely utilized by approximately million in secured borrowings and million fhlb letter of credit used for collateralization of oregon public deposits held by the bank 
in addition  at december   the bank had short term borrowings from the frb of approximately million and the bank also had undrawn borrowing capacity at frb of approximately million at december  that is currently supported by specific qualifying collateral 
borrowing capacity from fhlb or frb may fluctuate based upon the 
table of contents acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
also  frb or fhlb could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings 
as with many community banks  correspondent banks have withdrawn unsecured lines of credit or now require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds on a short term basis due to the present adverse economic environment 
in  the us tlgp under which the fdic would temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior debt of fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
on february  the bank issued million of notes under the tlgp 
the issuance included million floating rate and million fixed rate notes maturing february  liquidity may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
historically a significant portion of such commitments such as lines of credit have expired or terminated without funding 
in addition  more than one third of total commitments pertain to various construction projects 
under the terms of such construction commitments  completion of specified project benchmarks must be certified before funds may be drawn 
at december   the bank had approximately million in outstanding commitments to extend credit  compared to approximately million at year end at this time  management believes that the bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business 
inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices  therefore  the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the disclosures in this item are qualified by the risk factors set forth in item a and the section entitled cautionary information concerning forward looking statements included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report and any other cautionary statements contained herein 
interest rate risk and asset and liability management the goal of the company s asset and liability management policy is to maximize long term profitability under the range of likely interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk management requires estimating the probability and impact of changes in interest rates on assets and liabilities 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
management hires and engages a qualified independent service provider to assist in modeling  monthly reporting and assessing interest rate risk 
the company s methodology for analyzing interest rate risk includes simulation modeling as well as traditional interest rate gap analysis 
while both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates  it is management s opinion that simulation is the more effective tool for asset and liability management 
the bank has historically adjusted its sensitivity to changing interest rates by strategically managing its loan and deposit portfolios with respect to pricing  maturity or contractual characteristics 
the bank may also target the expansion or contraction of specific investment portfolio or borrowing structures to further affect its risk profile 
in addition  the bank is authorized to enter into interest rate swap or other hedging contracts with re pricing characteristics that tend to moderate interest rate risk 
however  there are no material structured hedging instruments in use at this time 
because of the volatility of market rates  event risk and other uncertainties described below  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve its interest rate risk objectives 
to assess and estimate the degree of interest rate risk  the company utilizes a sophisticated simulation model that estimates the possible volatility of company earnings resulting from changes in interest rates 
management first establishes a wide range of possible interest rate scenarios over a two year forecast period 
such scenarios routinely include a stable or unchanged scenario and an estimated or most likely scenario 
table of contents given current and forecast economic conditions 
in addition  scenarios titled rising rates  declining rates  and alternate rising rates are established to stress test the impact of more dramatic rate movements that are perceived as less likely  but may still possibly occur 
next  net interest income and net income are simulated in each scenario 
note that earnings projections include the effect of estimated loan and deposit growth that management deems reasonable  however  such volume projections are not varied by rate scenario 
note also that the downturn in real estate has caused elevated levels of non performing loans which lower reported nim depending on the absolute volume of such assets 
simulated earnings are compared over a two year time horizon 
the following table defines the market interest rates projected in various interest rate scenarios 
generally  projected market rates are reached gradually over the year simulation horizon

estimated rate scenario compared to ar first twelve month average change in pro forma net interest income second twelve month average change in pro forma net interest income th month annualized change in pro forma net interest income declining rate scenario alternate rising rate scenario rising rate scenario management s assessment of interest rate risk and scenario analysis must be considered in the context of market interest rates and overall economic conditions 
the federal reserve is holding short term rates low in an effort to stimulate economic growth 
the yield curve is unusually steep as a result 
rates are expected to rise toward the end of as the fed reduces the excess liquidity in the monetary system 
in management s judgment and at this date  the interest rate risk profile of the bank is reasonably balanced within the most likely range of possible outcomes 
the model indicates that should future interest rates actually follow the path indicated in the estimated rate scenario  the net interest margin would range between and all else being equal 
however  with the more dramatic changes reflected in the rising or declining scenarios  the model suggests the margin would likely fall outside of this range should such interest rates actually occur 
this is mainly because the bank has a large portion of non interest bearing funds approximately of total deposits that are assumed to be relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates 
thus in the event of rising rates  yields on earning assets would tend to increase at a faster pace than overall cost of funds  leading to an improving margin 
conversely  should rates fall to the low levels assumed in the declining scenario  yields on loans and securities would compress against an already low cost of funds 
also in this declining rate scenario  the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate on loans currently outstanding that would refinance to lower rates  contributing to margin compression 
thus in the declining rate scenario where the federal fund rates fall to just  the model indicates that the net interest margin could be or less during the first months of the forecast horizon  and below during the second twelve months 
management has concluded that the degree of margin and earnings volatility under the above scenarios is acceptable because of the cost of mitigating such risk and because the model suggests that the bank would still generate satisfactory returns under such circumstances 

table of contents please carefully review and consider the following information regarding the risk of placing undue reliance on simulation models  interest rate projections and scenario results 
in all scenarios discussed above  results are modeled using management s estimates as to growth in loans  deposits and other balance sheet items  as well as the expected mix and pricing thereof 
these volume estimates are static in the various scenarios 
such estimates may be inaccurate as to future periods 
model results are only indicative of interest rate risk exposure under various scenarios 
the results do not encompass all possible paths of future market rates  in terms of absolute change or rate of change  or changes in the shape of the yield curve 
nor does the simulation anticipate changes in credit conditions that could affect results 
likewise  scenarios do not include possible changes in volumes  pricing or portfolio management tactics that may enable management to moderate the effect of such interest rate changes 
simulations are dependent on assumptions and estimations that management believes are reasonable  although the actual results may vary substantially  and there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of future earnings under such conditions 
this is  in part  because of the nature and uncertainties inherent in simulating future events including no presumption of changes in asset and liability strategies in response to changing circumstances  model assumptions may differ from actual outcomes  uncertainties as to customer behavior in response to changing circumstances  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit volume changes  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  unexpected behavior by competitors  and other unanticipated credit conditions or other events impacting volatility in market conditions and interest rates 
interest rate gap table in the opinion of management  the use of interest rate gap analysis is less valuable than the simulation method discussed above as a means to measure and manage interest rate risk 
this is because it is a static measure of rate sensitivity and does not capture the possible magnitude or pace of rate changes 
at year end  the company s one year cumulative interest rate gap analysis indicates that rate sensitive liabilities maturing or available for re pricing within one year exceeded rate sensitive assets by approximately million 
the company considers its rate sensitive assets to be those that either contains a provision to adjust the interest rate periodically or matures within one year 
these assets include certain loans and leases and investment securities and interest bearing balances with fhlb 
rate sensitive liabilities are those liabilities that are considered sensitive to periodic interest rate changes within one year  including maturing time certificates  savings deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and junior subordinated debentures 

table of contents set forth below is a table showing the interest rate sensitivity gap of the company s assets and liabilities over various re pricing periods and maturities  as of december
