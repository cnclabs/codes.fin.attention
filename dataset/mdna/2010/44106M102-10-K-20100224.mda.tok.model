item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts overview the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
developments us hotel industry 
the us hotel industry continues to feel the effects of the recent recession 
in both and  the us hotel industry generally experienced declines versus the previous year in occupancy  revenues and profitability 
in  our properties experienced a decline in revenue per available room  or revpar  and a decline in cash flow available to pay our minimum returns and rents compared to revpar at our hotels was down in january versus january these declines reflect reduced business and leisure travel resulting from reduced business and consumer spending 
as of december   all returns and rent payments due to us under our hotel operating agreements were current except for the marriott no 
and no 
agreements discussed below 
our hotel operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees and security deposits  which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our operating agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  several of the guarantees and all of the security deposits are for limited amounts and may be exhausted  particularly if the us economy does not fully recover from the recent recession in a reasonable amount of time 
accordingly  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted receipt by us of minimum rents and returns is not assured 
if our tenants  managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our tenants and managers 
during the twelve months ended december   all payments due to us under our hotel leases and hotel management contracts were paid when due except for certain payments from marriott and crestline 
during the twelve months ended december   the payments we received under our marriott no 
contract that requires minimum annual payments to us of approximately  and under our marriott no 
contract that requires minimum annual rent payments to us of approximately  were  and  respectively  less than the minimum amounts contractually required 
we applied the available security deposits to cover these deficiencies 
also  during the period between december  and february   we did not receive payments to cure shortfalls for the marriott no 
and marriott no 
contracts of  and  respectively  and we applied the security deposits we hold to cover these amounts 
at february   the remaining balances of the security deposits which we hold for the marriott no 
and marriott no 
contracts were  and  respectively 
at this time  we expect that marriott will continue to pay us the net cash flows from operations of the hotels included in the defaulted contracts 
we believe the remaining amounts of security deposits we hold from marriott and from crestline for these contracts will exceed the shortfall of the payments we expect to receive compared to the minimum payments due to us under these contracts 
other than applying the security deposits to pay the differences between the net cash flows received from operations of these hotels and the contractual minimum payments  we have not yet determined what additional actions  if any  we may take as a result of these defaults 
when we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold for these agreements or any other operating agreements for payment deficiencies  we record income equal to the amounts by which these deposits are reduced up to the minimum return or minimum rent due to us 
however  reducing the 
table of contents security deposits does not result in cash flow to us of the deficiency amounts  but reducing amounts of security deposits does reduce the refunds due to the respective lessees or managers who have provided us with these deposits 
these deposits are not escrowed 
under all of our hotel contracts that include a security deposit  any amount of the security deposit which is applied to payment deficits may be replenished from future cash flows under the respective contracts 
as of february   all other payments due to us from our hotel managers and hotel tenants under our operating agreements were current 
ta rent deferral 
in  ta accrued  of deferred rent under the provisions of the rent deferral agreement entered by us and ta in august of due to the uncertainties regarding ta s ability to perform its obligations under its leases with us  we have reserved previously accrued straight line rent and deferred recognition of future straight line and deferred rents until circumstances change or these amounts are collected 
ta has elected to defer  of rent for december and january  payable in each of january and february  as it is permitted to do under the rent deferral arrangement 
under the terms of the deferral agreement  beginning on january  interest began to accrue at per month on deferred amounts outstanding  and ta paid interest to us of on february  ta was formerly our owned subsidiary and it became a public company in a spin off transaction in rmr provides certain management services to both us and ta

the terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of 
table of contents total sales at our hotels 
the decrease in ff e reserve income hotels is primarily due to decreased levels of hotel sales in versus at our leased hotels 
we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels as ff e reserve income 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates during the decrease in hotel operating expenses was primarily caused by the decline in occupancy at our managed hotels  manager initiatives to lower expenses  the reduction in expenses such as marketing and reservation fees which are based on revenues and  as discussed below  the funding by certain of our managers of minimum return deficiencies and our application of a security deposit to cover a minimum return deficiency 
our share of the operating results of our managed hotels in excess of the minimum returns due to us  or additional returns  under our hotel management agreements is recognized as income at year end when all contingencies are met and the income is earned 
we recognized additional returns of  in the fourth quarter no additional returns were earned in the decrease in additional returns from is due primarily to the decline in the net operating results of our hotels as a result of the weakness in the hotel industry described above 
certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  less than the minimum returns due to us in  but these amounts were funded by the managers of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements  or in the case of our marriott no 
agreement  applied from the security deposit we hold 
we reflected these amounts in our consolidated statement of income as a reduction to hotel operating expenses 
all of our managed hotels generated net operating results above the minimum returns due to us in the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average borrowings partially offset by slightly higher weighted average interest rates during than in the increase in depreciation and amortization hotels is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us in and the decrease in depreciation and amortization travel centers is primarily due to fully depreciated improvements that were retired during partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to our travel centers during and the increase in general and administrative expense is due primarily to higher professional services fees in the increase in income tax expense is primarily the result of higher state income taxes due to an increase in taxable income for state income tax purposes as a result of our lower common share distributions in we recorded a  reserve in the second quarter of to fully reserve the straight line rent receivable relating to our lease with ta for travel centers 
we recorded a  loss on asset impairment in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets arising from our january ta acquisition to their estimated fair market value

table of contents the decrease in hotel operating revenues in versus was caused primarily by our sale of managed hotels in february  june and december and the conversion of our kauai marriott hotel from managed to leased effective january   partially offset by slightly higher revenues at our remaining managed hotels 
revenues decreased at most of our managed hotels from due to lower occupancy rates  however  these declines were offset by increased revenues at our renovated and rebranded hyatt place hotels in additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page the increase in minimum rents hotels is a result of the conversion of the kauai marriott hotel to a leased hotel as described above and our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that resulted in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us 
the increase in minimum rents travel centers is a result of our acquisition of travel centers and commencement of our second lease with ta on may   offset by the deferral of  of rent by ta under the terms of our deferral agreement with ta 
rental income travel centers includes  and  of adjustments necessary to record rent on the straight line basis for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we ceased recognizing straight line rent under our lease with ta for travel centers in the second quarter of due to the uncertainties regarding its collectibility 
the decrease in percentage rent hotels is the result of decreased sales compared to base year sales at our leased hotels 
the increase in ff e reserve income hotels is primarily due to the conversion of the kauai marriott hotel to a leased hotel as described above offset by decreased levels of hotel sales in versus at our leased hotels 
we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower average cash balances and lower average interest rates during the decrease in hotel operating expenses from was primarily caused by the sale of the three managed hotels and the conversion of our kauai marriott hotel described above 
we recognized additional returns of  and  in the fourth quarter and  respectively 
the decrease in additional returns from is due primarily to weaker operating performance as a result of weakness in the us hotel industry described above 
all of our managed hotels generated net operating results above the minimum returns due to us in certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  less than the minimum returns due to us in  but these amounts were funded by the manager of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements 
we reflected these amounts in our consolidated statement of income as a reduction to hotel operating expenses 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average borrowings  partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate during than in the increase in depreciation and amortization hotels is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us in and the increase in depreciation and amortization travel centers is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of our and travel center acquisitions and improvements made to our travel centers during and the increase in general and administrative expense is due primarily to the impact of additional property investments during and  offset by lower incentive advisory fees recognized in than in 
table of contents the  loss on asset impairment in was to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets to their estimated net realizable value 
we recorded a  loss on asset impairment in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of a hotel held for sale to its estimated net realizable value less costs to sell 
we recorded a  reserve on a straight line rent receivable related to our lease with ta for travel centers in due to uncertainty regarding its collectibility 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to lower federal alternative minimum tax for our trs and foreign taxes relating to our hotels in puerto rico and canada in the net gain on sale of real estate in reflects the sale of three hotels described above

liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts our managers and tenants all of our properties are operated under management agreements or leases 
all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by the third party hotel managers as agents for us or by hotel or travel center tenants for their own account 
these managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  ff e reserve  and returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these managers and tenants fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our management agreements or leases as total property sales minus all property level expenses that are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our operating agreements is presented in the tables on pages and during the twelve months ended december   all of our hotel operating agreements  generated coverage of less than x x to x 
we define coverage for each of our travel center leases as total property level sales minus all property level expenses divided by the minimum rents due to us 
during the twelve months ended december   our two travel center leases  representing properties  generated coverage of x and x  respectively 
effective july   we entered into a rent deferral agreement with ta  the tenant under our two travel center leases 
however  we calculated the rent coverage ratios for the twelve months ended december  using the contractual rent amounts without consideration of the rent deferral 
because substantially all of ta s business is conducted at properties leased from us  property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate ta s ability to pay rents due to us 
we believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what a operator interested to acquire these properties or the leaseholds might use to evaluate these properties contributions to their earnings before corporate level expenses 

table of contents three hundred fifty of our properties  representing of our total investments at cost as of december   are operated under nine management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the total sales less total expenses and required hotel ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us 
some of our managers and tenants or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the manager  tenant or guarantor from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as described above  marriott and crestline have failed to pay the full minimum return or rent amounts due to us under the marriott no 
and marriott no 
agreements  respectively 
as of february   all other payments due from our managers and tenants are current 
however several of the guarantees and all the security deposits are for limited amounts and may be exhausted  especially if the us economy does not fully recover from the recent recession in a reasonable time period 
accordingly  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured 
if any of our property operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service interest and distributions to shareholders 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
however  because of the impact of the weak us economy on the hotel and travel center industries  our operators and tenants may be unable to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due  in which case our cash flow and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of our distributions to common shareholders 
we maintain our status as a reit under the irc by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
the rma was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to trss if the hotels are managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
the income we receive from our hotels in canada and puerto rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements 
during the twelve months ended december   our hotel managers and hotel tenants contributed  to these accounts and  was spent from the ff e reserve escrow accounts and from our payments to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
as of december   there was  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held directly by us and is reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 

table of contents our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we will provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed ff e reserves 
to the extent we make such additional fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of ff e reserve fundings available from hotel operations  as follows during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for improvements to hotels included in our four marriott portfolio agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund approximately  for improvements to these marriott hotels during with funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the january lease agreement we entered with a subsidiary of marriott for our kauai hotel  we agreed to fund certain planned improvements to that hotel 
we funded  for improvements under this agreement during the twelve months ended december  using funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not expect to make any additional fundings related to the planned improvements that we expect to be completed during as we funded these improvements  the annual rent payable to us under this lease increased 
pursuant to an april agreement we entered with a subsidiary of hyatt for management of amerisuites hotels  we agreed to provide funding to hyatt for rebranding of these hotels to the hyatt place brand and for other improvements 
to the extent our fundings exceed  the minimum return payable by hyatt to us increases as these funds are advanced 
as of december   we have funded  we funded  of this amount during the twelve months ended december  using funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
rebranding of the final hotel was completed in and we do not expect to make any fundings for improvements to these hotels during pursuant to january and april agreements we entered with intercontinental  for the management of ten hotels  we agreed to fund  for capital improvements to these hotels during the three years following closing 
we made our final funding under this agreement of  in january using funds from our existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as we funded these improvements  the minimum returns payable to us increased 
our travel center leases with ta do not require ff e escrow deposits 
however  ta is required to maintain the leased travel centers  including structural and non structural components 
on may   we entered into an amendment to our lease with ta for travel centers 
the historical lease provided for our purchase from ta of an aggregate of  of specified capital improvements to the leased travel centers during the first five years of the lease term  and that these purchases were limited to  per year 
the amendment provides that ta may accelerate our purchase of the specified capital improvements 
in the event that ta sells us capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount is discounted to reflect the accelerated disbursement of funds by us according to a present value formula established in the amendment 
as of december   we have funded  and our remaining undiscounted purchase commitment under this lease is  which we expect to fund in using existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
under both our leases with ta  ta may request that we fund additional amounts for capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for annual minimum rent increases  we made no fundings under such lease provisions during the twelve months ended december  
table of contents on january   april   july  and october   we paid a per share distribution to our series b preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ended january   april   july  and october   respectively

on december   we announced our intention to resume making regular quarterly common share distributions in on january   we declared a per share per share per year distribution to our common shareholders of record on january  we paid this distribution on february  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during the twelve months ended december   we repurchased  of our convertible senior notes at a total cost of  excluding accrued interest  and recognized a  gain on extinguishment of debt  net of unamortized discount  issuance costs and a portion of the equity component attributable to the conversion feature 
we made these purchases using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during the second quarter of  we repurchased  of our senior notes at a total cost of  excluding accrued interest  and recognized a  gain on extinguishment of debt  net of unamortized discount and issuance costs 
we made these purchases using borrowings under our revolving credit facility

we made these purchases using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on june   we sold  of our common shares at a price of per share in a public offering 
on july   we sold  of our common shares at a price of per share pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters 
we used the net proceeds from these sales approximately  after underwriting and other offering expenses to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on august   we issued  of senior notes due in a public offering 
net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting and other offering expenses were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents on august   we sold  of our common shares at a price of per share in a public offering 
on august   we sold  of our common shares at a price of per share pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters 
we used the net proceeds from these sales approximately  after underwriting and other offering expenses to repay all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes 
in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
the maturity date of our revolving credit facility is october  and  subject to certain conditions  we have the option to extend the facility for one additional year upon payment of an extension fee of  the annual interest rate payable for drawn amounts under the facility is libor plus a spread 
we may borrow up to  under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unsecured 
we may draw  repay and redraw funds until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we continue to monitor market conditions for comparable revolving credit facilities  and to date our board of trustees has not made a decision to either pursue a new or amended revolving credit facility or exercise the one year extension option 
at december   we had  of cash excluding ff e restricted cash and cash equivalents and  available from our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and for other general business purposes 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in   in   in  and  in our  of convertible senior notes due in are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option  with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
as of december   we had one mortgage note with a current principal balance of  that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of a hotel 
this mortgage note requires monthly payments of for principal and interest and is expected to have an unpaid principal balance of  at maturity in july none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their respective maturity dates 
when amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although recent capital market conditions have improved  the availability and cost of credit continue to be volatile  and credit availability for companies in the hotel and hospitality industry remains tight 
if we are able to renew our revolving credit facility  one or more financial institutions which now participate may choose not to participate in the renewal  we may be unable to find replacement lenders and our access to borrowing under the renewed facility could be reduced 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to renew our revolving credit facility or that  if renewed  we will be able to maintain its current size 
also  if current market conditions worsen  one or more 
table of contents lenders under our current revolving credit facility may be unable or unwilling to fund advances which we request or we may be unable or unwilling to renew our revolving credit facility  and we may not be able to access alternative capital 
while we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity  to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable 
also  the current market conditions have led to increased credit spreads which  if they continue  may result in increased interest costs when we renew our revolving credit facility or refinance our other debts 
these interest cost increases could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations capital improvements projected interest expense total holders of our convertible senior notes  due in may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  the amounts in the table reflect these notes as being due on their maturity date and therefore are included in the more than years category 
of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center 
represents amounts we expect to fund for capital improvements to our properties in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations 
projected interest expense is attributable to only the long term debt obligations listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments  new debt issuances or changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december  consist of our revolving credit facility  our  of unsecured term debt and convertible notes and our  mortgage note 
our unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our 
table of contents revolving credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our revolving credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
if our credit rating is downgraded  our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility would therefore increase 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions with any other debts of  or more 
similarly  our revolving credit facility agreement has cross default provisions with other indebtedness that is recourse of  or more and indebtedness that is non recourse of  or more

the petro lease became effective on may  the ta lease expires on december  the petro lease expires on june   and may be extended by ta for up to two additional periods of years each 
both the ta lease and the petro lease are triple net leases  which require ta to pay all costs incurred in the operation of the leased travel centers  including personnel  utilities  acquiring inventories  services to customers  insurance  real estate and personal property taxes  environmental related expenses and ground lease payments  if any 
the minimum rent payable by ta to us under the ta lease increases annually during the first six years of the lease term from  to  and may increase if we fund or reimburse the cost in excess of  see below for certain improvements to the leased ta travel centers 
the petro lease requires ta to pay minimum annual rent of  to us 
starting in and  respectively  the ta lease and petro lease require ta to pay us additional rent equal to of increases in nonfuel gross revenues and of increases in gross fuel revenues at the leased travel centers over base amounts 
the increases in percentage rents attributable to fuel revenues are subject to a maximum each year calculated by reference to changes in the consumer price index 
ta is also required to generally indemnify us for certain environmental matters and for liabilities which arise during the terms of the leases from ownership or operation of the 
table of contents leased travel centers 
the ta lease and the petro lease also include arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
we had agreed to provide up to  of funding annually for the first five years of the ta lease for certain improvements to the leased properties without an increase in rent 
this funding was cumulative  meaning if some portion of the  was not spent in one year it may be drawn by ta from us in subsequent years  provided  however  none of the  of funding was available to be drawn after december  all improvements funded under the tenant improvements allowance are owned by us 
on may   we and ta amended the ta lease to permit ta to sell to us  without an increase of its rent  certain capital improvements to properties leased from us earlier than previously permitted 
in the event that ta elects to sell these capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount is discounted to reflect the accelerated receipt of funds by ta according to a present value formula established in the amended lease 
during and  ta sold to us qualifying capital improvements under the  tenant improvements allowance provided in the ta lease  as amended in may  for total cash proceeds of  and  respectively 
at december    of the  total amount of the leasehold improvements saleable to us with no increase in ta s rent remained available  which amount would be discounted in accordance with the amended lease to the extent those funds are received by us on an accelerated basis 
as of the date of this report  ta has not sold any such leasehold improvements in to us 
ta may request that we fund approved amounts for renovations  improvements and equipment at the leased travel centers  in addition to the  described above  in return for minimum annual rent increases according to a formula the minimum rent per year will be increased by an amount equal to the amount funded by us times the greater of i or ii a benchmark us treasury interest rate plus 
since january   ta has not sold any such leasehold improvements to us 
at the time of ta s spin off from us  our acquisitions and transactions with ta in connection with the petro lease and an equity offering completed by ta in june  we and ta believed that ta was adequately capitalized to meet all of its obligations  including those owed to us 
however  since then there were material changes in the market conditions under which ta was operating 
specifically  the increase during the first half of in the price of diesel fuel which ta buys and sells at its travel centers and the slowing of the us economy during adversely affected ta s business and increased its working capital requirements 
although ta had undertaken a restructuring of its business to adjust to these changed market conditions  ta s balance sheet flexibility and liquidity remained a concern in light of the impact the then weakening economy and fuel price volatility might have on ta s working capital requirements 
under those circumstances  on august   we and ta entered a rent deferral agreement 
under the terms of this deferral agreement ta has the option to defer its monthly rent payments to us by up to  per month for periods beginning july  until december   and ta was not obligated to pay cash interest on the deferred rent through december  also pursuant to the deferral agreement  ta issued  of its common shares to us approximately of ta s shares then outstanding immediately after this new issuance 
beginning on january   interest on all unpaid deferred rent under the deferral agreement accrues at a rate of per month and is payable monthly by ta to us 
no additional rent deferrals are permitted for rent periods after december  any deferred rent and interest thereon not paid is due to us on july  ta may repay any deferred amounts and related interest at any time 
this deferral agreement also includes a prohibition on share repurchases and dividends by ta while any deferred rent remains unpaid and has change of control covenants so that amounts deferred will be immediately payable to us in the event ta experiences a change of control as defined in the agreement while deferred rent is unpaid 
in connection with this deferral agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with ta  which provides us with certain rights to require ta to conduct a registered public offering underwritten or otherwise with respect to its common shares issued to us pursuant to the deferral agreement  which rights continue through the date which is twelve months following the 
table of contents latest of the expiration of the terms of the ta lease and the petro lease 
as of december   ta had accrued an aggregate of  of deferred rent payable to us  and ta deferred an additional  for january rent payable on february  during  ta paid us cash rent of  under its leases with us 
at the time ta became a separate publicly owned company as a result of the distribution of its shares to our shareholders  ta entered a management and shared services agreement with rmr 
rmr also provides management services to us 
the terms of ta s agreements with us and rmr require that ta afford us a right of first refusal to purchase  lease  mortgage or otherwise finance any interest ta owns in a travel center before it sells  leases  mortgages or otherwise finances that travel center to or with another party  and that ta afford us a right of first refusal to acquire or finance any real estate of the types in which we invest before ta does 
ta also agreed under these agreements to not permit the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of or more of the voting shares or the power to direct the management and policies of ta or any of its subsidiary tenants or guarantors under its leases with us  the sale of a material part of the assets of ta or any such tenant or guarantor  or the cessation of certain continuing directors constituting a majority of the board of directors of ta or any such tenant or guarantor

we have two agreements with rmr to provide management and administrative services to us a business management agreement and a property management agreement 
these agreements were recently amended on january  the business management agreement provides for compensation at an annual rate equal to of the average historical cost of our real estate investments  as described in the business management agreement  up to the first  of such investments  and thereafter 
in addition  rmr receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our cash available for distribution per share  as defined in the business management agreement 
the incentive fee is paid in common shares 
at present  the property management agreement applies to management services to the office building component of one property in baltimore  maryland which also includes an intercontinental hotel 
the property management agreement provides for management fees relating to this office building equal to of gross rents and construction management fees equal to of certain construction costs 
renewals or extensions of the business management agreement and the property management agreement are subject to the annual approval of our independent trustees 
the aggregate business management and property management fees for were  we are generally responsible for all of our expenses and certain expenses incurred by rmr on our behalf 
we are not responsible for payment of rmr s employment  office or administration expenses  except for our pro rata portion of the employment and related expenses of rmr employees who provide on site property management services and of the staff employed by rmr who conduct our internal audit 
under our management agreements with rmr  we acknowledge that rmr manages other businesses  including hrp  snh  gov  ta and five star  and will not be required to present us with opportunities to invest in properties that are primarily of a type that are within the investment focus of another business now or in the future managed by rmr 
under our business management agreement with rmr  rmr has agreed not to provide business management services to any other reit who is principally engaged in the business of ownership of hotel or travel center properties without the consent of our independent trustees 
the business management agreement and the property management agreement also include arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
our audit 
table of contents committee appoints our director of internal audit  and our compensation committee approves his salary and the costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function 
our pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function was in  which amount is in addition to the aggregate fees to rmr described above 
in addition to mr

adam portnoy  mr 
barry portnoy s son 
adam portnoy is our other managing trustee and also serves as the president  chief executive officer and a director of rmr 
each of our executive officers is also an officer of rmr  including mr 
ethan bornstein  who is the son in law of mr 
barry portnoy and the brother in law of mr 
adam portnoy 
transactions between us and rmr are approved by our compensation committee which is composed of our independent trustees 
we  rmr and other companies to which rmr provides management services formed affiliates insurance company  or aic  which is an insurance company  in the state of indiana in november aic received its certificate of authority to transact insurance business in the state of indiana from the indiana department of insurance in may all of our trustees currently serve on the board of directors of aic 
rmr  in addition to being a shareholder  entered a management agreement with aic pursuant to which rmr provides aic certain management and administrative services 
in addition  aic entered an investment advisory agreement with rmr advisors pursuant to which rmr advisors acts as aic s investment advisor 
the same persons who own and control rmr  including messrs 
barry and adam portnoy  our managing trustees  own and control rmr advisors 
our governance guidelines provide that any material transaction between us and aic shall be reviewed  authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire board and the affirmative vote of a majority of our independent trustees 
as of february   we have invested million in aic 
on december   gov purchased  shares of aic from aic  which represented a interest in aic  post acquisition 
in connection with that purchase by gov  we  the other previous shareholders of aic  aic and gov entered an amended and restated shareholders agreement 
the amended and restated shareholders agreement includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
we and the other shareholders of aic each currently own approximately of aic 
we may invest additional amounts in aic in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital  but we are not obligated to do so 
over time we expect to obtain some or all of our insurance coverage from aic 
by participating in this insurance business with rmr and the other companies to which rmr provides management services  we expect that we may benefit financially by reducing insurance expenses or by realizing our pro rata share of any profits of this insurance business 
all transactions between us and aic have been approved pursuant to our governance guidelines

we believe that our agreements with ta  rmr and aic are on commercially reasonable terms 
nonetheless  because of our various relationships with ta  rmr and aic it is possible that some investors may assert otherwise 
for instance  a purported shareholder derivative action has been commenced against ta  its directors  us and rmr which alleges  among other matters  that the rent ta agreed to pay us under the petro lease  which ta entered in connection with the petro transaction described above  is too high 
the terms of ta s agreement with us may require ta to indemnify us for liabilities  costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with this litigation 
rmr has been voluntarily dismissed from the litigation 
we have demanded arbitration of all claims against us pending in this litigation and we and the plaintiff have agreed to defer the arbitration demand

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect our classification of leases and the related impact on the recognition of rental income  allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate and intangible assets  variable interest entities  and income taxes 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 

table of contents we allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their fair values and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we record building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value 
we allocate the excess  if any  of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill 
we base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and  under some circumstances  studies from independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives 
we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
we amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
we do not depreciate the allocated cost of land 
purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates 
incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods 
we periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
an impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value 
we determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
these analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
we have determined that each of our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  is a variable interest entity as defined under the consolidation topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification tm  or the codification 
under this topic  the entity that receives the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of the variable interest entity  with the primary focus on losses  is the variable interest entity s primary beneficiary  and is required to consolidate the variable interest entity 
when one of our trss enters a new operating agreement or materially modifies an existing operating agreement with a third party hotel manager  we are required to assess if our trs or the hotel manager is or continues to be the primary beneficiary 
this assessment requires us to make estimates of the future cash flows of our trs 
incorrect assumptions or estimates of  among other things  future occupancy  average daily room rate and operating expenses of our hotels may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
we have concluded that we must consolidate each of our trss because we are the primary beneficiary 

table of contents we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the codification 
under this topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
despite our reit status  we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trs that  unlike most of our subsidiaries  is generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the trs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
the income taxes topic also prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
tax returns filed for the through tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future  we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels and travel centers that are grouped into operating agreements 
our hotels are managed by or leased to subsidiaries of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host  barcel crestline corporation  or barcel crestline  hyatt and carlson under agreements 
our travel centers are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of ta under two agreements 

table of contents the tables on the following pages summarize the key terms of our leases and management agreements as of december   and include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our managers and tenants 
these statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy  adr  and revpar  for our hotel properties 
we consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables on the following pages  to be important measures of our managers and tenants success in operating our properties and their ability to continue to pay us 
however  none of this third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance and none of it has been independently verified by us

hyatt carlson total average includes data for the calendar year indicated  except for our marriott branded hotels  which include data for comparable fiscal periods 

table of contents seasonality our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flow because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return payments and rents to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our managers or tenants ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of insufficient income at our properties  all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future  the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of climate change the current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our hotel and travel center properties to increase 
we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations  because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or operators directly or in the longer term  passed through and paid by customers of our properties 
although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future  laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or operators and their ability to pay rent or returns to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 

table of contents as of december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of eight issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate  convertible senior notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  except as described in the footnote to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
however  if we refinance these notes at maturity at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our  of convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the noteholder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
at december   we had one mortgage note payable  secured by one hotel  that has a principal balance of  and a fixed interest rate of that matures on july  this note requires monthly principal and interest payments of through maturity  is expected to have an unpaid principal balance of  at maturity and contains a provision that allows us to make repayment at a premium to face value 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october subject to certain conditions  we can extend the maturity for one year for a fee of  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings and  available to draw under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents repayments under this agreement may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under these agreements are subject to interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar short term interest rates  specifically libor 
in addition  upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility  we are vulnerable to increases in credit spreads due to market conditions 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with changes in the outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility 
the following table presents the impact of a change in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at december  if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt
