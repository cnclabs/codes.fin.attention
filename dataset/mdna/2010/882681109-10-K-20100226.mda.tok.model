our founder and chairman  w 
kent taylor  started the business in our mission statement is legendary food  legendary service 
our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants as the local hometown destination for a broad segment of consumers seeking high quality  affordable meals served with friendly  attentive service 
the first texas roadhouse restaurant opened in clarksville  indiana in february as of december   there were restaurants operating in states  including company restaurants  of which were wholly owned and were majority owned 
the results of operations of company restaurants are included in our consolidated operating results

additionally  we provide various management services to these franchise restaurants  as well as five additional franchise restaurants in which we have no ownership interest 
we have contractual arrangements which grant us the right to acquire at pre determined valuation formulas i the remaining equity interests in eight of the majority owned company restaurants and ii of the franchise restaurants 
presentation of financial and operating data we operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last tuesday in december 
fiscal year was weeks in length and  as such  the fourth quarter of fiscal year was weeks in length 
fiscal years and were weeks in length  while the fourth quarters for those years were weeks in length 
long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing markets and new domestic or international markets 
we will remain focused primarily on mid sized markets where we believe there exists a significant demand for our restaurants because of population size  income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base 
restaurants that we owned and operated for the full six months before the beginning of generated average unit volumes of million for in  the total average capital investment for developing our prototype restaurant  including pre opening expenses  was million 
for  we expect our average capital investment to decrease to to million  as a result of building design modifications and lower site work costs  as landlords are becoming responsible for a higher portion of certain of these costs 
our ability to expand our 
table of contents restaurant base is influenced by factors beyond our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth 
due  in part  to increasing restaurant development costs  we moderated our restaurant development plans for and we continue to focus on driving sales and decreasing restaurant development costs in order to increase our restaurant development in the future 
we may  at our discretion  add franchise restaurants  domestically and or internationally  primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with the texas roadhouse or other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions 
we may also look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
additionally  from time to time  we will evaluate potential mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts 
of the restaurants we owned and operated at the end of  operated as texas roadhouse restaurants  while one operated under the name of aspen creek 
the majority of our restaurant growth in will be texas roadhouse restaurants  however  we plan to open two to three additional aspen creek restaurants as we continue testing the viability of the concept 
maintaining and or improving restaurant level profitability 
we plan to maintain  or possibly increase  restaurant level profitability through a combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management 
leveraging our scalable infrastructure 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments in our infrastructure  including information systems  real estate  human resources  legal  marketing and operations 
historically  general and administrative costs have increased at a slower growth rate than our revenue 
whether we are able to continue leveraging our infrastructure will depend  in part  on our new restaurant and comparable restaurant sales growth rates going forward 
stock repurchase program 
we continue to look at opportunities to repurchase our common stock at favorable market prices under our stock repurchase program 
currently  our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of the end of  million worth of common stock remains authorized for repurchase 
we made no repurchases of our common stock during the weeks ended december  key operating personnel key personnel who have a significant impact on the performance of our restaurants include managing and market partners 
each company restaurant has one managing partner who serves as the general manager 
market partners can provide supervisory services for up to to managing partners and their respective management teams

key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular fiscal period 
for company restaurant openings we incur pre opening costs  which are defined below  before the restaurant opens 
typically new restaurants open with an initial start up period of higher than normalized sales volumes  which decrease to a steady level 
table of contents approximately three to six months after opening 
however  although sales volumes are generally higher  so are initial costs  resulting in restaurant operating margins that are generally lower during the start up period of operation and increase to a steady level approximately three to six months after opening 
comparable restaurant sales growth 
comparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year over year sales for the comparable restaurant base 
we define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full months before the beginning of the later fiscal period excluding restaurants closed during the period 
comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by changes in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average annual restaurant sales for all company restaurants open for a full six months before the beginning of the period measured 
average unit volume excludes sales on restaurants closed during the period 
growth in average unit volumes in excess of comparable restaurant sales growth is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the company average 
conversely  growth in average unit volumes less than growth in comparable restaurant sales growth is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels lower than the company average 
store weeks 
store weeks represent the number of weeks that our company restaurants were open during the reporting period

higher average hourly wage rates resulted from several state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates throughout and  including increases in the federal minimum wage rate in july and july we anticipate our labor costs will continue to be pressured by inflation  which is primarily caused by federal and state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates 
these increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments

we either lease our restaurant site locations under operating leases for periods of five to years including renewal periods or purchase the land where it is cost effective 
as of december   there were restaurants developed on land which we owned 
our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new restaurants we open  the timing of those openings and the restaurant prototype developed in a given fiscal year 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new restaurants and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure is able to support a larger restaurant base

we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation asc 
as required by asc  share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate restaurants  cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment 
our evaluation requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life  which can be for a period of over years 
in the estimation of future cash flows  we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
if assets are determined to be impaired  we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
we generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal  if available 
when fair value is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows  the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
we also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we have assigned goodwill to the reporting 
table of contents unit  which we consider to be the individual restaurant level 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
in estimating discounted cash flows we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods  expectations of future sales growth and terminal value 
assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
we also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
at december   we had reporting units  primarily at the restaurant level  with allocated goodwill of million 
the average amount of goodwill associated with each reporting unit is million with six reporting units having goodwill in excess of million 
based on projected future cash flows  we are currently monitoring four restaurants with total goodwill of million 
since we determine the fair value of goodwill at the restaurant level  any significant decreases in cash flows at these restaurants or others could trigger an impairment charge in the future 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below workers compensation general liability property we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
estimates of claims reserves are discounted using a discount rate of approximately at december  resulting in a discount of million 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb asc fasb asc requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
effects of inflation we believe inflation has had a negative effect on our operations during the past few years as we have not substantially offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu  increasing menu prices and or making other adjustments 
whether we are able and or choose to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what  if any  extent inflation affects our operations in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
our options for the rate are the base rate  which is the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus an applicable margin 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
should interest rates based on these borrowings increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by million 
on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  which started on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
our counterparty in the interest rate swap is jp morgan chase  na on january   we entered into another interest rate swap  starting february   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on january   effectively resulting in a fixed rate libor component of the million notional amount 
many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and cheese  and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for other commodities  we employ various purchasing and 
table of contents pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating market prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon two to four vendors 
if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
