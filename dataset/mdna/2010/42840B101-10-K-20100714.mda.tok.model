as potential competitors come into the market and begin selling dorzolamide products  the company anticipates a decline in the sales price and gross profit margin for such products 
additionally  both midlothian laboratories and ecr pharmaceuticals have higher gross margins than hi tech s core generic business  therefore  increased sales from these divisions contributed to the higher gross margin 
the company increased overhead spending in the information systems  quality and regulatory areas

these inflows were offset by an increase of accounts receivables of  and various other changes in working capital accounts 
the receivables for the company increased primarily due to the increase in sales of  in the fourth quarter and extended terms offered to certain customers

additionally  the updates amend existing guidance to require a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
since the amended guidance requires only additional disclosures  the adoption of the provisions effective may  will not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
the implementation of this guidance  for the provisions effective january   did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which is included in the codification in fasb accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles

asu also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the guidance if effective for the company during the interim period ended october  the implementation of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby 
as a result  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments which impact our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include but are not limited to the percentage of new products which may have chargebacks and the percentage of items which will be subject to price decreases 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  adjustments for returns and price adjustments  allowance for doubtful accounts and carrying value of inventory represent significant estimates made by management 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment and when risk is passed to the customer and when estimates of discounts  rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable  collection is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
these estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable 
estimated sales returns  allowances and discounts are provided for in determining net sales 
contract research income is recognized as work is completed and billable costs are incurred 
in certain cases  contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones 
adjustments for returns and price adjustments our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks  rebates  rights of return  pricing adjustments and other allowances 
based on our agreements and contracts with our customers  we calculate adjustments for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the adjustments against accounts receivable and revenue 
chargebacks  primarily from wholesalers  are the most significant of these items 
chargebacks result from arrangements we have with end users establishing prices for products for which the end user independently selects a wholesaler from which to purchase 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler  which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost  and the end customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price 
therefore  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
the reserve for chargebacks is computed in the following manner 
the company obtains wholesaler inventory data for the wholesalers which represent approximately of our chargeback activity 
this inventory is multiplied by the historical percentage of units that are charged back and by the price adjustment per unit to arrive at the chargeback accrual 
this calculation is performed by product by customer 
the calculated amount of chargebacks could be affected by other factors such as a change in retail customer mix a change in negotiated terms with retailers 
table of contents product sales mix at the wholesaler retail inventory levels changes in wholesale acquisition cost wac the company continually monitors the chargeback activity and adjusts the provisions for chargebacks when we believe that the actual chargebacks will differ from our original provisions 
consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period 
the company s estimate for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual returns 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors its estimates for returns and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals 
included in the adjustment for sales allowances and returns is a reserve for credits taken by our customers for rebates  return authorizations and other discounts 
sales discounts are granted for prompt payment 
the reserve for sales discounts is based on invoices outstanding and assumes that of available discounts will be taken 
price adjustments  including shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued from time to time to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and inventory held by the customer 
the company analyzes this on a case by case basis and makes adjustments to reserves as necessary 
the company adequately reserves for chargebacks  discounts  allowances and returns in the period in which the sales takes place 
no material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks and the provision for sales discounts recorded in the current period relate to sales made in the prior periods 
the provision for sales allowances and returns includes reserves for items sold in the current and prior periods 
the company has substantially and consistently used the same estimating methods 
we have refined the methods as new data became available 
there have been no material differences between the estimates applied and actual results 
the company determines amounts that are material to the financial statements in consideration of all relevant circumstances including quantitative and qualitative factors 
among the items considered is the impact on individual financial statement classification  operating income and footnote disclosures and the degree of precision that is attainable in estimating judgmental items 
the following table presents the roll forward of each significant estimate  which balances are reflected as deductions from accounts receivable as of april   and and for the years then ended  respectively 
beginning balance may current provision actual credits in current period ending balance april for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we have historically provided credit terms to customers in accordance with what management views as industry norms 
financial terms  for credit approved customers  are generally on either a net or day basis  though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount 
management periodically and regularly reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of average cost or market  with cost being determined based upon the average method 
in evaluating the inventory  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience  product expiration dates and management s assessment of current product demand 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of april  we are not involved in any material unconsolidated transactions

some of the figures included in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors
