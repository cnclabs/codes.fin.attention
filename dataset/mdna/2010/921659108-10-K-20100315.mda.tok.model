some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k include historical information and other information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and contain forward looking statements that involve risk  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the risk factors section of this report and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of clinical stage products for central nervous system disorders 
we believe that each of our products and partnered products will address a large market with significant unmet medical needs by offering advantages over currently available therapies 
our product portfolio includes fanapt tm iloperidone  a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis 
we had originally entered into a sublicense agreement with novartis on june  pursuant to which we obtained certain worldwide exclusive licenses from novartis relating to fanapt tm 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
novartis began selling fanapt tm in the us during the first quarter of except for two post approval studies started by us prior to the execution date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement  both of which were substantially completed by december   novartis is responsible for the further clinical development activities in the us and canada  including the development of a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt tm 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and will be eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt tm in the us and canada 
we will also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
in addition  we will no longer be required to make any future milestone payments with respect to sales of fanapt tm or any future royalty payments with respect to sales of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt tm outside the us and canada and we will have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt tm for developing and commercializing fanapt tm outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt tm outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt tm outside of the us and canada 
on february   the pto issued a notice of allowance for our patent application for the long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt tm 
the pto has informed us that the application is eligible for patent term adjustment of an additional days  making the patent expiration date august  tasimelteon  a compound for the treatment of sleep and mood disorders  including circadian rhythm sleep disorders crsd 
in november  we announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in transient insomnia 
in june  we announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia 
on january   the united states food and drug administration fda granted orphan designation status for tasimelteon in the crsd  non hour sleep wake disorder in blind individuals without light perception 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting  or fewer us patients per year 
orphan drug designation provides potential financial and regulatory incentives including study design assistance  waiver of fda user fees  tax credits  and up to seven years of market exclusivity upon marketing approval 
we will continue to explore the path to an nda for tasimelteon 
given the range of potential indications for tasimelteon  we may pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of tasimelteon worldwide 
since we began our operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our compounds 
our ability to generate additional revenues largely depends on novartis ability to successfully commercialize fanapt tm in the us and to successfully develop and commercialize fanapt tm in canada and upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the development of our products or product candidates  and to obtain the regulatory approvals for and manufacture  market and sell our compounds 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of part i of this annual report on form k  entitled risk factors 
we completed our initial public offering in april the offering totaled  shares of common stock at a public offering price of  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million  after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions as well as offering expenses 
upon completion of the initial public offering  all shares of the company s series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
in january we completed our follow on offering  consisting of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital throughout and beyond 
however  for the immediate future  we expect to continue to operate on a reduced spending plan with our fixed overhead costs expected to be approximately million to million per year 
fanapt tm 
we have developed fanapt tm  and will continue to develop it outside the us and canada  to treat schizophrenia 
on may   the fda granted us marketing approval of fanapt tm for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis relating to fanapt tm 
we had originally entered into a sublicense agreement with novartis on june  pursuant to which we obtained certain worldwide exclusive licenses from novartis relating to fanapt tm 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
except for two post approval studies started by us prior to the execution date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement  both of which were substantially completed by december   novartis is responsible for the further clinical development activities in the us and canada  including the development of a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt tm 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and will be eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt tm in the us and canada 
we will also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
in addition  we will no longer be required to make any future milestone payments with respect to sales of fanapt tm or any future royalty payments with respect to sales of fanapt tm in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt tm outside the us and canada and we will have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt tm for developing and commercializing fanapt tm outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt tm outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt tm outside of the us and canada 
novartis launched fanapt tm in the us on january  for the year ended december  we incurred approximately million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of fanapt tm 
as a result of the fda s approval of the nda for fanapt tm  we met an additional milestone under the original sublicense agreement which required us to make a license payment of million to novartis 
the million was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt tm 
tasimelteon 
tasimelteon is our product under development to treat sleep and mood disorders 
tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that works by adjusting the human body clock or circadian rhythm 
tasimelteon has successfully completed a phase iii trial for the treatment of transient insomnia in november in june  we announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia 
the trial was a randomized  double blind  and placebo controlled study with patients 
the trial measured time to fall asleep and sleep maintenance  as well as next day performance 
on january   the fda granted orphan designation status for tasimelteon in the crsd  non hour sleep wake disorder in blind individuals without light perception 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting  or fewer us patients per year 
orphan drug designation provides potential financial and regulatory incentives including study design assistance  waiver of fda user fees  tax credits  and up to seven years of market exclusivity upon marketing approval 
we will continue to explore the path to an nda for tasimelteon 
tasimelteon is also ready for phase ii trials for the treatment of depression 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in direct research and development costs directly attributable to our development of tasimelteon 
revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an up front payment  product sales and future milestone and royalty payments 
revenue is considered both realizable and earned when each one of the following four conditions is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the million upfront payment will be recognized ratably on a straight line basis from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt tm may  
approximately million of the million upfront payment was recognized as revenue for the year ended december  revenue related to product sales is recognized upon delivery to novartis 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in product revenue related to the sale of inventory to novartis 
we will recognize revenue from fanapt tm royalties and commercial and development milestones from novartis when realizable and earned 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of fees for services provided by third parties in connection with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  milestone license fees  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  cost for regulatory consultants and filings  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our compounds  related facilities costs  and salaries  other employee related costs and stock based compensation for the research and development personnel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred for compounds in the development stage  including certain payments under our license agreements 
prior to fda approval  all fanapt tm manufacturing related and milestone costs were included in research and development expenses 
post fda approval of fanapt tm  manufacturing and milestone costs related to this product are being capitalized 
costs related to the acquisition of intellectual property have been expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these acquisitions were made in connection with the company s research and development efforts and have no alternative future use 
milestone payments are accrued in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies which states that milestone payments be accrued when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will be achieved 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our products and product candidates and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
for the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products and product candidates 
we also expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we continue our efforts to develop our products and product candidates and to evaluate potential in license product candidates 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the years ended december  to december  included in the following table are the research and development expenses recognized in connection with the clinical development of fanapt tm and tasimelteon 
included in other product candidates are the costs directly related to research initiatives for all other product candidates 
year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  direct project costs fanapt tm tasimelteon other product candidates total direct product costs indirect project costs facility depreciation other indirect overhead costs total indirect expenses total research and development expenses many of our research and development costs are not attributable to any individual project because we share resources across several development projects 
we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs and stock based compensation for personnel  serving executive  business development  marketing  finance  accounting  information technology and human resource functions  facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  insurance costs and professional fees for legal  accounting and other professional services 
general and administrative expenses also include third party expenses incurred to support business development  marketing and other business activities related to fanapt tm 
for the year ended december   we incurred general and administrative expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
interest and other income  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and we have accordingly included them in this discussion 
inventory 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to cost of sales 
prior to fda approval  all fanapt tm manufacturing related costs were included in research and development expenses 
subsequent to fda approval of fanapt tm  manufacturing costs related to this product are capitalized 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we have sold the majority of our finished product to novartis and plan to sell the remainder in early intangible asset  net 
costs incurred for products or product candidates not yet approved by the fda and for which no alternative future use exists are recorded as expense 
in the event a product or product candidate has been approved by the fda or an alternative future use exists for a product or product candidate  patent and license costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected patent life of the related product or product candidate 
milestone payments to our partners are recognized when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will occur 
as a result of the fda s approval of the nda for fanapt tm  we met a milestone under our original sublicense agreement with novartis which required us to make a payment of million to novartis 
the million is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt tm  which we expect to last until may  this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the hatch waxman or pediatric extensions are not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
amortization of the intangible asset is recorded as a component of cost of goods sold 
the carrying values of intangible assets are periodically reviewed to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred 
we had no impairments of our intangible assets for the year ended december  accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
the estimation of accrued expenses involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements 
accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as those under contracts with clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  fees for marketing and other commercialization activities  and severance related costs due to our workforce reduction that took place in december of pursuant to our assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize these expenses as the services are provided 
our assessments include  but are not limited to an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  analyses of data that justify the progress  and management s judgment 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an up front payment  product revenue and future milestone and royalty revenues 
revenue is considered both realizable and earned when each one of the following four conditions is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis has the right to commercialize and develop fanapt tm in the us and canada 
under the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million in december of pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we and novartis established a joint steering committee jsc following the effective date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement 
we expect to have an active role on the jsc and concluded that the jsc constitutes a deliverable under the amended and restated sublicense agreement and that revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably over the term of the jsc  however  the delivery or performance has no term as the exact length of the jsc is undefined 
as a result  we deem the performance period of the jsc to be the life of the us patent of fanapt tm  which we expect to last until may  this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent 
revenue will be recognized ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt tm may  
we will recognize revenue related to fanapt tm royalties and commercial and development milestones as they are realizable and earned  and product revenue upon delivery of our products to novartis 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the fasb guidance on share based payments january  using the modified prospective transition method of implementation and adopted the accelerated attribution method 
we currently use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable entities and other factors due to the lack of historic information of our publicly traded common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on the transition approach provided by fasb guidance as the options meet the plain vanilla criteria required by this method 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock based compensation expense for a period is also affected by expected forfeiture rate for the respective option grants 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments or expected forfeitures are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
total stock based compensation expense  related to all of our stock based awards for the years ended december   and  was comprised of the following year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense per basic and diluted share of common stock since we had a net operating loss carryforward as of december   no excess tax benefits for the tax deductions related to stock based awards were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  no incremental tax benefits were recognized from stock options exercised in or which would have resulted in a reclassification to reduce net cash used in operating activities with an offsetting increase in net cash provided by financing activities 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the accounting guidance will be applied prospectively and will become effective during the first quarter of early adoption is allowed 
we will adopt this guidance beginning january  and we do not expect this accounting guidance to materially impact our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements for related to the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements 
those disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including any possible payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  and the timing and outcome of clinical trials and related possible regulatory approvals 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis relating to fanapt tm 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million 
of which we recognized million as revenue in the remaining amounts will be recognized ratably over the us patent life of fanapt tm which we expect to last until may  this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent 
in addition  we recognized million of product revenue in for product sold to novartis 
we will be eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt tm in the us and canada 
we will also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt tm in the us and canada

clinical trials expense decreased by approximately million primarily due to the costs incurred in in our phase iii trial of fanapt tm in schizophrenia and in our tasimelteon clinical pharmacology trials that were completed in the clinical trial costs incurred in related primarily to our phase iii trial of tasimelteon in primary insomnia that we initiated during the third quarter of contract research and development  consulting  materials and other direct costs decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of decreased development costs incurred in connection with the lower manufacturing costs for the fanapt tm and tasimelteon programs offset by the increase in consulting fees incurred with the engagement of the regulatory consultant to assist us in our efforts to obtain fda approval of the fanapt tm nda 
prior to fda approval of our products  manufacturing related costs were included in research and development expense 
there were no milestone license fees incurred in stock based compensation expense decreased by approximately million as a result of the lower fair value of options granted during compared to options granted in prior periods and the reversal of cumulative amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to the cancellation of unvested options in connection with the workforce reduction in december general and administrative expenses

marketing and related consulting services decreased by approximately million due to the decrease in our market research and other pre commercial launch activities following receipt of the not approvable letter from the fda regarding the nda for fanapt tm 
legal and other professional expenses increased by approximately  due primarily to a higher level of consulting activity in in support of business development activities 
other expenses decreased by approximately  primarily due to lower accounting fees than those incurred in to initially bring the company in compliance with sarbanes oxley 
other income  net 
net other income for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  interest income decreased by approximately million due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances for the year and lower short term interest rates which generated substantially lower interest income than in other income for the year ended december  included approximately  in revenue recognized from a grant from the economic development board in singapore

the million was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt tm  which we expect to last until may  this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the hatch waxman or pediatric extensions are not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic life using the straight line method 
amortization expense was approximately  for the year ended december  we capitalized and began amortizing the asset immediately following the fda approval of the nda for fanapt tm

deposits held with these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits  but we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such deposits 
in september  the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb agreed to delay the effective date of this guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  we have adopted the provisions of the guidance as of january  and january   for financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities  respectively 
although the adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements 
fasb guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable level defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions as december   we did not hold any assets or liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
as of december   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurements at reporting date using quoted prices in active markets for significant other significant identical assets observable inputs unobservable inputs december  level level level description available for sale securities total our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital throughout and beyond 
however  for the immediate future  we expect to continue to operate on a reduced spending plan

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
marketable securities we deposit our cash with financial institutions that we consider to be of high credit quality and purchase marketable securities which are generally investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k
